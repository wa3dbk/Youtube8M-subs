on/off<00:00:37.079> on/off<00:00:39.210> tap<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:41.230> like<00:00:41.560> to<00:00:41.680> keep<00:00:41.800> the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
on/off on/off tap I like to keep the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.210 
on/off on/off tap I like to keep the
time<00:00:42.190> there<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.440> we'll<00:00:44.440> go<00:00:44.590> over<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.890> slider

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
time there and we'll go over the slider

00:00:45.220 --> 00:01:13.980 
time there and we'll go over the slider
a<00:00:45.370> little<00:00:45.520> bit<00:00:45.880> later<00:00:46.270> but<00:00:47.230> here<00:00:47.739> we<00:00:47.829> go

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.680 

Oh

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.630 

Oh

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:43.850 

you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.070 

they'll<00:01:44.860> turn<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:45.310> some<00:01:45.520> modulation

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
they'll turn on some modulation

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:56.670 
they'll turn on some modulation
I<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.550> modulation<00:01:55.060> real<00:01:55.480> subtle<00:01:56.260> in<00:01:56.440> the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
I like the modulation real subtle in the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.740 
I like the modulation real subtle in the
mix<00:01:56.920> but<00:01:57.280> if<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.520> crank<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.090> guy<00:01:58.300> up<00:01:58.480> it<00:01:58.660> gets

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
mix but if you crank this guy up it gets

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:14.730 
mix but if you crank this guy up it gets
pretty<00:01:59.110> dramatic<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:14.020> don't<00:02:14.380> know<00:02:14.500> who

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
pretty dramatic so I don't know who

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380 
pretty dramatic so I don't know who
would<00:02:14.860> use<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.850> different<00:02:16.120> if

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
would use that but it is different if

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.580 
would use that but it is different if
you're<00:02:16.540> looking<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:16.870> weird<00:02:17.050> sounds<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.380> like

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you're looking for weird sounds I like

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:37.750 
you're looking for weird sounds I like
it<00:02:17.740> about<00:02:17.830> right<00:02:18.460> there

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.050 

so<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:39.030> nice<00:02:39.239> simple<00:02:39.719> modulation<00:02:41.060> also

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
so just nice simple modulation also

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.240 
so just nice simple modulation also
we'll<00:02:43.049> go<00:02:43.200> over<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.530> feedback<00:02:44.069> in

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
we'll go over the feedback in

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.649 
we'll go over the feedback in
oscillation<00:02:46.370> sorry<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.489> said<00:02:47.760> oscillation

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
oscillation sorry I said oscillation

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.390 
oscillation sorry I said oscillation
when<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> met<00:02:48.959> modulation<00:02:49.409> before<00:02:49.769> let's<00:02:50.250> go

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
when I met modulation before let's go

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.970 
when I met modulation before let's go
over<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.609> feedback<00:02:50.939> in<00:02:51.120> oscillation<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:51.980> if

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
over the feedback in oscillation now if

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.250 
over the feedback in oscillation now if
you<00:02:53.220> crank<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:53.760> guy<00:02:53.939> up<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.420> will<00:02:54.569> oscillate

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
you crank this guy up it will oscillate

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:07.690 
you crank this guy up it will oscillate
on<00:02:55.980> its<00:02:56.340> own

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.040 

just<00:03:08.120> like<00:03:08.240> any<00:03:08.420> good<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:10.070> know<00:03:10.190> delay<00:03:10.550> pedal

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
just like any good you know delay pedal

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.510 
just like any good you know delay pedal
although<00:03:12.050> if<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.320> switch<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.920> oscillation

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
although if you switch the oscillation

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.440 
although if you switch the oscillation
switch<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.840> oscillates<00:03:15.350> right<00:03:15.920> here

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
switch on it oscillates right here

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.480 
switch on it oscillates right here
typically<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.170> here<00:03:18.380> we<00:03:18.470> go<00:03:24.130> maybe<00:03:25.130> not<00:03:25.340> that

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
typically so here we go maybe not that

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:45.160 
typically so here we go maybe not that
soon<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:27.440> bring<00:03:27.710> back<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.840> can<00:03:44.990> see

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
soon but you bring back so you can see

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.210 
soon but you bring back so you can see
it<00:03:45.290> really<00:03:45.410> smacks<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.580> delay<00:03:46.910> harder

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
it really smacks the delay harder

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.860 
it really smacks the delay harder
according<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.490> Chinese<00:03:50.180> instructions

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
according to the Chinese instructions

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.370 
according to the Chinese instructions
what<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.140> can<00:03:51.410> make<00:03:51.530> out<00:03:51.710> it's<00:03:52.700> kind<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.210> a

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
what I can make out it's kind of just a

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.110 
what I can make out it's kind of just a
gain<00:03:54.380> boost<00:03:54.830> but<00:03:55.100> I'm<00:03:55.190> not<00:03:55.310> sure<00:03:55.580> on<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.760> one

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
gain boost but I'm not sure on that one

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.240 
gain boost but I'm not sure on that one
which<00:03:56.750> are<00:03:56.900> there<00:03:57.080> are<00:03:57.170> pedal<00:03:57.890> geeks<00:03:58.100> out

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
which are there are pedal geeks out

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:30.500 
which are there are pedal geeks out
there<00:03:58.460> that<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.940> do<00:03:59.060> better<00:03:59.270> than<00:03:59.480> me<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.750> it

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.470 

so<00:04:31.510> last<00:04:32.139> but<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.590> least<00:04:33.300> we're<00:04:34.300> going<00:04:34.389> to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
so last but not least we're going to

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.060 
so last but not least we're going to
talk<00:04:34.600> about<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:35.230> tap<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.280> time<00:04:36.550> slider

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
talk about the tap and the time slider

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.060 
talk about the tap and the time slider
really<00:04:39.070> useful<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.360> tap<00:04:40.660> works<00:04:41.050> only<00:04:41.500> when

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
really useful the tap works only when

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.860 
really useful the tap works only when
the<00:04:42.130> effect<00:04:42.610> is<00:04:42.790> on<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:46.330> tap<00:04:46.600> can

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
the effect is on and the tap can

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.879 
the effect is on and the tap can
actually<00:04:47.440> be<00:04:48.120> kind<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.389> preset<00:04:50.139> actually

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
actually be kind of a preset actually

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.590 
actually be kind of a preset actually
the<00:04:51.010> time<00:04:51.220> slider<00:04:51.490> is<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.730> preset<00:04:52.120> because

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
the time slider is the preset because

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.120 
the time slider is the preset because
when<00:04:52.810> if<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.350> were<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:54.990> crank<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.260> speed<00:04:56.650> up<00:04:56.860> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
when if I were to crank the speed up I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.909 
when if I were to crank the speed up I
can<00:04:57.850> still<00:04:58.090> tap<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.450> slower<00:04:59.010> tempo<00:05:01.770> which<00:05:02.770> it

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
can still tap a slower tempo which it

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.760 
can still tap a slower tempo which it
picks<00:05:03.130> up<00:05:03.930> but<00:05:04.930> as<00:05:05.050> soon<00:05:05.140> as<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.440> turn<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
picks up but as soon as I turn the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.470 
picks up but as soon as I turn the
effect<00:05:05.860> off<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.550> defaults<00:05:07.060> back<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
effect off it defaults back to the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.150 
effect off it defaults back to the
slider<00:05:07.780> as<00:05:08.140> you<00:05:08.950> can<00:05:09.100> see<00:05:09.490> or<00:05:09.700> not<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.800> will<00:05:11.950> go

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
slider as you can see or not and will go

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.650 
slider as you can see or not and will go
so<00:05:13.919> it<00:05:14.919> is<00:05:15.100> pretty<00:05:15.370> cool<00:05:15.610> if<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.030> want<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.360> find

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
so it is pretty cool if you want to find

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
so it is pretty cool if you want to find
a<00:05:16.810> tempo<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.860> really<00:05:18.220> like<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.900> then<00:05:20.050> tap<00:05:20.410> in

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
a tempo you really like and then tap in

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.090 
a tempo you really like and then tap in
from<00:05:21.190> wherever<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:22.990> I<00:05:23.260> like<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.890> some

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
from wherever it is I like that some

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.469 
from wherever it is I like that some
people<00:05:24.400> might<00:05:24.580> not<00:05:24.760> but<00:05:24.970> I<00:05:25.030> think<00:05:25.300> that's

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
people might not but I think that's

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.190 
people might not but I think that's
pretty<00:05:25.660> useful<00:05:26.160> and<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:28.570> last<00:05:28.810> thing<00:05:28.990> about

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
pretty useful and the last thing about

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.350 
pretty useful and the last thing about
it<00:05:29.350> is<00:05:29.470> with<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.889> tap<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.790> can<00:05:30.820> get<00:05:31.180> those

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
it is with the tap you can get those

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.520 
it is with the tap you can get those
cool

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
cool

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.820 
cool
I<00:05:32.590> call<00:05:33.370> them<00:05:33.460> spaceship<00:05:33.970> noises<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:35.620> the

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
I call them spaceship noises in the

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.680 
I call them spaceship noises in the
middle<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.370> song<00:05:36.640> right<00:05:36.940> away<00:05:36.970> I'll<00:05:37.510> show

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
middle of a song right away I'll show

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.110 
middle of a song right away I'll show
you<00:05:37.780> what<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:37.990> mean<00:05:38.370> turn<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.520> mix<00:05:39.790> up<00:05:39.970> a<00:05:40.090> little

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
you what I mean turn the mix up a little

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.960 
you what I mean turn the mix up a little
more<00:05:40.680> turn<00:05:41.680> this<00:05:41.860> on<00:05:42.070> so<00:05:42.100> if<00:05:42.460> we<00:05:42.580> just<00:05:42.760> hit<00:05:42.910> a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
more turn this on so if we just hit a

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:54.930 
more turn this on so if we just hit a
nice<00:05:43.360> chord

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.159 

so<00:05:55.940> not<00:05:56.180> sure<00:05:56.449> if<00:05:56.539> you<00:05:56.629> heard<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:56.840> I'll<00:05:57.050> turn

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
so not sure if you heard that I'll turn

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.240 
so not sure if you heard that I'll turn
the<00:05:57.289> mix<00:05:57.590> up<00:05:57.740> a<00:05:57.830> little<00:05:57.860> more<00:05:59.259> and<00:06:00.259> hopefully

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
the mix up a little more and hopefully

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:47.439 
the mix up a little more and hopefully
you'll<00:06:01.580> hear<00:06:01.759> it<00:06:44.530> so<00:06:45.530> there<00:06:45.770> you<00:06:45.889> have<00:06:45.919> it<00:06:46.449> cool

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
you'll hear it so there you have it cool

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.640 
you'll hear it so there you have it cool
spaceship<00:06:48.169> noises<00:06:48.500> on-the-fly<00:06:49.539> check<00:06:50.539> it<00:06:50.690> out

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
spaceship noises on-the-fly check it out

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.120 
spaceship noises on-the-fly check it out
they<00:06:52.340> say<00:06:52.669> it's<00:06:52.819> an<00:06:52.940> analogue<00:06:53.330> pedal<00:06:53.779> with<00:06:54.770> DSP

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
they say it's an analogue pedal with DSP

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
they say it's an analogue pedal with DSP
for<00:06:55.550> tap<00:06:55.759> tempo<00:06:56.110> I<00:06:57.610> tried<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.699> take<00:06:58.849> it<00:06:58.940> apart

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
for tap tempo I tried to take it apart

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.540 
for tap tempo I tried to take it apart
and<00:06:59.240> look<00:06:59.479> but<00:06:59.659> I<00:06:59.719> couldn't<00:07:00.110> see<00:07:00.400> it<00:07:01.400> just

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
and look but I couldn't see it just

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.800 
and look but I couldn't see it just
looked<00:07:01.699> like<00:07:01.729> a<00:07:01.819> circuit<00:07:02.150> board<00:07:02.300> for<00:07:02.449> me<00:07:02.599> I

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
looked like a circuit board for me I

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.779 
looked like a circuit board for me I
don't<00:07:03.139> build<00:07:03.289> pedals<00:07:03.650> I<00:07:03.800> just<00:07:03.979> play<00:07:04.130> them<00:07:04.310> I

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
don't build pedals I just play them I

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.790 
don't build pedals I just play them I
hope<00:07:05.240> you<00:07:05.330> guys<00:07:05.449> like<00:07:05.630> the<00:07:05.750> demo<00:07:05.930> see<00:07:06.440> you<00:07:06.529> next
