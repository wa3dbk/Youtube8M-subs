00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.910
 good then there I miss you just a time 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.109
 I replace you bob is always in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.670
 the little Swiss of the pocket gate 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.900
 So here in our case it was included 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.640
 a side pocket door here against 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 so let's cross the problem that arises 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.490
 is that inside for example in 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.080
 the one I have there that is pretty good 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.570
 you see it's a full chassis so I 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 prefers a level of acoustics done 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.940
 at the level of the fact that usually his 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 price on slides that are the song 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.050
 so if they prefer in this context 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 there I know the references besides due 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 of the frame in question we play look at me 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.629
 I have a catch here and a catch that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 is lower here is me you do not see it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.250

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.699

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.409

 So that is your small screws 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.340

 loved as my time I did not break through 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.990
 through all this I caught myself in 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.100
 the pupil who goes over so there was zero 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.800

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:05.800
 there on the back I put two vices 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.350
 to agree on 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.750
 here there were debts of return 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.850

 a screw that will take it there you see 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.610

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.970
 so here I am not in the structure 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.630

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.500
