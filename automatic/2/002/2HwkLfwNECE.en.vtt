00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
to keep it all off because after I've

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
to keep it all off because after I've
juiced<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> past<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:54.570> lose<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.079> weight

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but then you end up pretty much putting

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.800 
but then you end up pretty much putting
it<00:01:57.869> back<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.579> go<00:02:00.390> back<00:02:00.600> into

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it back on if you don't go back into

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.190

eating<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.799> way<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:03.020> since<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> quit

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
eating the right way but since I quit

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.520
