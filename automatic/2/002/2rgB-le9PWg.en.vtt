potential<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.019> guy<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.199> using<00:01:04.680> really

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
potential but this guy is using really

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.539

low<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.000> wall<00:01:06.750> defenses<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> makes<00:01:08.340> him<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
low on wall defenses so it makes him a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.940 
low on wall defenses so it makes him a
really<00:01:08.700> easy<00:01:08.850> target<00:01:09.330> he<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.600> almost<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
really easy target he has almost all of

his gold mines a level 10 and stuff well
he<00:01:14.820> barely<00:01:15.060> got<00:01:15.150> any<00:01:15.390> defenses<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.650> made

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
he barely got any defenses that are made

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.050 
he's wrong but anyhow are gonna use my
giants<00:02:09.780> by<00:02:10.229> got<00:02:10.560> almost<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.220> them<00:02:11.640> level

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
giants by got almost all of them level

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.670 
giants by got almost all of them level

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
tree

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.520 
tree
and<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.879> to<00:02:13.909> deploy<00:02:14.269> them<00:02:14.480> from<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.260> site

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and I have to deploy them from this site

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.319 
and I have to deploy them from this site
because<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.920> can't<00:02:16.159> really<00:02:16.280> do<00:02:16.489> much<00:02:16.519> from<00:02:17.060> this

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
because I can't really do much from this

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
defenses I'm going to try and bred to

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.309 
defenses I'm going to try and bred to
hear<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:30.379> what<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> can<00:02:30.650> do<00:02:30.980> oh<00:02:32.319> it's

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
hear and see what I can do oh it's

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.240 
hear and see what I can do oh it's
deployable<00:02:34.010> over<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.459> um<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.709> forced<00:02:37.159> you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
deployable over there um if I forced you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.300 
deployable over there um if I forced you
here<00:02:37.639> I<00:02:37.870> should<00:02:38.870> hope<00:02:39.079> they<00:02:39.349> get<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.069> motor

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
here I should hope they get to the motor

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.089 
here I should hope they get to the motor
before<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.599> motor<00:02:42.139> actually<00:02:42.379> is<00:02:42.650> twice<00:02:42.889> too

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
before the motor actually is twice too

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.619 
before the motor actually is twice too
many<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.400> my<00:02:43.549> troops<00:02:43.819> but<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.299> guess<00:02:44.510> they're

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
many of my troops but I guess they're

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.110 
many of my troops but I guess they're
going<00:02:44.810> for<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.049> resources<00:02:45.590> first<00:02:45.859> so<00:02:46.250> that

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
going for the resources first so that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.170 
going for the resources first so that
should<00:02:47.419> be<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> bad<00:02:47.810> thing<00:02:48.109> for<00:02:48.769> me<00:02:49.189> but<00:02:49.519> at<00:02:50.030> this

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
should be a bad thing for me but at this

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.140 
should be a bad thing for me but at this
very<00:02:50.389> point<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.780> seem<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.049> be<00:02:51.169> doing<00:02:51.290> very<00:02:51.620> good

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
very point I seem to be doing very good

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.280 
very point I seem to be doing very good
destroyed<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.269> motor<00:02:53.510> they<00:02:53.870> destroyed<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
destroyed the motor they destroyed the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.920 
destroyed the motor they destroyed the
air<00:02:54.409> defense<00:02:54.739> I'm<00:02:55.159> not<00:02:55.819> only<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.239> more<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.780> go

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
air defense I'm not only one more to go

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.640 
air defense I'm not only one more to go
and<00:02:56.959> all<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.500> his<00:02:57.620> defenses<00:02:58.219> are<00:02:58.430> gone<00:02:59.319> so<00:03:00.319> this

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
and all of his defenses are gone so this

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.259 
and all of his defenses are gone so this
rate<00:03:00.980> we'll<00:03:01.310> probably<00:03:01.609> be<00:03:01.849> very<00:03:01.879> successful

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
rate we'll probably be very successful

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.319 
rate we'll probably be very successful
and<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.109> will<00:03:03.260> be<00:03:03.379> able<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.769> actually<00:03:04.760> pull<00:03:05.180> off

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
and I will be able to actually pull off

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.789 
and I will be able to actually pull off
three<00:03:05.599> stars<00:03:05.900> at<00:03:06.169> least<00:03:06.379> that's<00:03:06.560> what<00:03:06.709> I'm

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
three stars at least that's what I'm

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.379 
three stars at least that's what I'm
hoping<00:03:06.859> off<00:03:07.189> um<00:03:08.829> there<00:03:09.829> seems<00:03:10.189> to<00:03:10.430> be<00:03:10.579> no<00:03:11.209> more

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
hoping off um there seems to be no more

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.819 
hoping off um there seems to be no more
defenses<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.169> they're<00:03:12.349> just<00:03:12.469> attacking

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
defenses so they're just attacking

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.550 
defenses so they're just attacking
random<00:03:13.129> ah<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.930> should<00:03:15.079> actually<00:03:15.200> be<00:03:15.530> a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
random ah this should actually be a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.680 
random ah this should actually be a
pretty<00:03:15.680> decent<00:03:16.340> thing<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:17.540> I'm<00:03:17.659> very

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
cost me seven hundred k elixir to

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.719 
cost me seven hundred k elixir to
upgrade<00:03:49.459> d<00:03:50.019> barracks<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.229> should<00:03:52.189> get<00:03:52.579> it

because at this moment I am able to find

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.830 
because at this moment I am able to find
really<00:04:01.699> good<00:04:01.819> fights<00:04:02.299> with<00:04:02.599> a<00:04:02.629> lot<00:04:02.810> of

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
really good fights with a lot of

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.050 
really good fights with a lot of
resources<00:04:03.290> but<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:04.189> defenses<00:04:04.669> are<00:04:04.790> too<00:04:04.939> great

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
resources but the defenses are too great

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.939 
resources but the defenses are too great
and<00:04:05.509> I<00:04:05.659> won't<00:04:05.810> be<00:04:05.840> able<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.109> pull<00:04:06.259> it<00:04:06.290> off<00:04:06.439> so<00:04:06.769> I

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
and I won't be able to pull it off so I

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.699 
and I won't be able to pull it off so I
got<00:04:07.189> three<00:04:07.549> stars<00:04:07.790> here<00:04:08.269> about<00:04:09.169> quite<00:04:09.680> a
