00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.560 

I<00:00:11.509> think<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:19.100> really<00:00:20.100> engages<00:00:20.279> them<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
I think it really engages them with the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.790 
I think it really engages them with the
curriculum<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> makes<00:00:22.590> things

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
curriculum and it makes things

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.410 
curriculum and it makes things
meaningful<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> them<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:32.270> would<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.360> never

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
meaningful to them I would have never

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.729 
meaningful to them I would have never
thought<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.870> sixth<00:00:34.170> grade<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.620> could

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
thought in sixth grade you could

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440 
thought in sixth grade you could
actually<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.190> create<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.790> design<00:00:35.880> 3d

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
actually like create and design 3d

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780 
actually like create and design 3d
objects<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.110> computers<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.460> wasn't

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
objects like computers like that wasn't

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
objects like computers like that wasn't
even<00:00:38.940> an<00:00:39.030> option<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
even an option I was kind of in the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.889 
even an option I was kind of in the
earlier<00:00:41.250> stages<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.450> drafting

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
earlier stages and we had drafting

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.350 
earlier stages and we had drafting
design<00:00:43.020> high<00:00:43.649> school<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:45.030> only<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
design high school and like only a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:01:01.580 
design high school and like only a
couple<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> touch

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.140 

even<00:01:01.860> for<00:01:02.010> geometry<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.550> teach<00:01:02.820> middle<00:01:03.000> school

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
even for geometry I teach middle school

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
even for geometry I teach middle school
junkie<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.810> think<00:01:04.170> it'd<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.290> great<00:01:12.470> at

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
junkie I think it'd be great at

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.980 
junkie I think it'd be great at
Gulfstream<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.550> really<00:01:14.850> trying<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.600> blend

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
Gulfstream are really trying to blend

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.350 
Gulfstream are really trying to blend
math<00:01:16.380> into<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.430> other<00:01:17.610> subject<00:01:18.180> areas

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
math into all the other subject areas

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780 
math into all the other subject areas
particularly<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.770> technology<00:01:20.550> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
particularly into technology and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
particularly into technology and
engineering<00:01:21.380> because<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.830> students<00:01:23.250> see

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
engineering because the students see

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
engineering because the students see
another<00:01:24.030> side<00:01:24.390> map<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.350> applied

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
another side map they see the applied

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
another side map they see the applied
math<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.550> see<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> applied<00:01:27.690> science

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
math and they see the applied science

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.400 
math and they see the applied science
and<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.830> clouds<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:36.170> make<00:01:37.170> some

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
and there are my clouds I make some

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.060 
and there are my clouds I make some
understand<00:01:37.830> things<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.660> spatially<00:01:39.660> I<00:01:39.780> guess

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
understand things more spatially I guess

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.200 
understand things more spatially I guess
because<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.220> lot<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.369> kids<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> easy

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
because there a lot of kids have easy

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.630 
because there a lot of kids have easy
feelings<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.050> algebra<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.580> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
feelings with algebra but then you get a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
feelings with algebra but then you get a
geometry<00:01:44.850> class<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.470> things

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
geometry class and they like just things

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.710 
geometry class and they like just things
out<00:01:47.190> but<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.210> makes<00:01:48.360> Java<00:01:48.570> should

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
out but this kind of makes Java should

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.999 
out but this kind of makes Java should
come<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> life<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.500> kind<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
come to life it's kind of like when I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.490 
come to life it's kind of like when I
was<00:01:50.250> learning<00:01:50.729> geometry<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> college<00:01:52.110> kid<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
was learning geometry as a college kid I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
was learning geometry as a college kid I
was<00:01:52.860> playing<00:01:53.039> pool<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.509> would<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.780> like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
was playing pool and I would see like

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
was playing pool and I would see like
the<00:01:55.050> pool<00:01:55.259> angles<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.399> geometry<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.940> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the pool angles and the geometry and it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.029 
the pool angles and the geometry and it
made<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.390> sense<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.800> way<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
made more sense so that was my way to

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.100 
made more sense so that was my way to
kind<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.220> like<00:01:59.310> teach<00:01:59.460> myself<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.930> bit

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
kind of like teach myself a little bit

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.749 
kind of like teach myself a little bit
of<00:02:01.200> geometry<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> gives<00:02:02.670> them

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
of geometry but this kind of gives them

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.040 
of geometry but this kind of gives them
the<00:02:02.880> spatial<00:02:03.210> perspective<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.869> things

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
the spatial perspective on things

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.300 
the spatial perspective on things
because<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:04.590> map<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.039> out<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
because they can actually map it out and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:15.890 
because they can actually map it out and
actually<00:02:05.460> make<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.789> real<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:12.410> me<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.650> like
