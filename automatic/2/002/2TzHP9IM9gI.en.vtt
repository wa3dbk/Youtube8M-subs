 compatible etc 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.989
 I have reserved for a moment me 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.750

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.440
 no more need of this thing 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.340
 we will fall back on the site l'alsace on 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.870
 the army-nation link this video next 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.910
 we will download on the other if two 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.900
 32-bit versions on the tools version 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.310
 64 bits 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.310
 so to find out if our computer and 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.380
 64 bits 62 bis we are going to start 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.720
 plus they are compatible windows 7 and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.760
 windows 8 8 points obviously you 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.070
 go after go up in property 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.630
 system and if you go to see systems 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.000
 64- bit operating system 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.770
 so I'm going to download version 64 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.680
 bits have frozen already downloaded because 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.120
 my connection ram a little bit fez was 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.340
 launched by concern a little bit of 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 time so here we will see what do you want 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.060
 do so we are going to put put to 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.199
 level this pc now what I think 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.500
 that if you watch this video it's 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.389
 to upgrade your computer 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.919
 so we'll do next so that's 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.830
 currently downloading windows 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.659
 I did not do it because I did not 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.190
 want more my connection to a lot 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.210
 hard to download plus 3 gigabytes 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.370
 would it take a little time and 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.630
 servers either it's rotten microsoft 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.940
 so after that it's like an installation 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.940
 normal are you going to want to ask him 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.490
 keep your records 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.260
 and programs etc be concerned that your 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.870
 files without programs or nothing 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.120
 keep at all and then he'll go 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.370
 say it's software that is not 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.840
 compatible with windows 10 or not and 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.160
 then it's going to settle down pretty north 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.780
 full screen will be installed your 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.230
 computer will restart maybe one to 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.200
 two times 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.090
 it's like a past of windows 8 this 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.080
 as if you are passing windows 7 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.120
 windows 8 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.800
