00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.740
 Servus people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.570
 new plugin conception today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.599
 around the plugins jump blogs and trampoline 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.509
 These plugins do what I already do 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.210
 seen on many major servers 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 that if you step on a sponge 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 one shot in the air is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 moment very in so watching us only 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.430
 once the baking pages on so once 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.380
 Here is kept small by trampoline 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.070
 not much there , I believe 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.820
 just a mission and that's it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.200
 actually download it as normal 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 I've already made here 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.590
 again to the next to gram blogs that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 is already something bigger but needs it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.309
 That's what you want 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 download has in any case many 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.700
 cool features and most importantly not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.189
 download here but my tip 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.799
 is that the version 3.0 of the still 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.580
 a few bugs in the menu and in the config 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.180
 but that in the versions you have to do that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.220
 if a user now tell me directly 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.970
 the server comes and jumps in the air 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.979
 just wanted to jump jbl self 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.439
 enter and with this version can the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.869
 Dirt jump so I think that it 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.490
 a little bit better for the the one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.409
 plug-in now just search here 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 this link is then definitely from 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.150
 this page in any case one 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.920
 description then then just click here 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.369
 I have already done download 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.680
 So very important version 3.0 very good 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.079
 then we can do that here again 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.880
 get away and we'll start with that 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.880
 plug-in trampoline saw 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.650
 then we always pull that one two 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:14.520
 States make the pressure during the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.520
 then starts in minecraft 1 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:30.220
 there is a look at them 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:34.150
 console here and trampoline label so 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.890
 has worked wonderfully so then look 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.420
 We have a little something 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.880
 prepared and you see, unfortunately works 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 There was no one here because I could too 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.860
 can show it quickly 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.680
 he did not create a config so you 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.970
 can not change anything that's all 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:02.230
 it stays that way as it is 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:04.270
 no, that just stays that way 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.870
 It was actually already from the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.180
 plugin so if you have something simple 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.930
 I want you then the plug-in 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.700
 recommend 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.450
 then i'll show you that too 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:21.610
 sometimes with the pension works 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:32.290
 just look what the pensions one 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:36.550
 moment please So this is a 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.130
 normal user op and as you can see here 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:51.489
 nothing happens if I do that now 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:53.430
 the pem michels give it so now it would have to 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.840
 actually work 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.350
 and you look for me and work 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.340
 that too it was to the plug-in then 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.290
 Let's go out here again 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:12.750
 and then I put the other plates 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.750
 just before the server again 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:25.030
 Then we come to blog blogs easy 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.600
 then the one pull out the two here 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.600
 move in 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:41.039
 the garden we will see the server again 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:47.080
 if that works at functionary ever 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:49.260
 and there blogs enabled enabled flames so 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.260
 Well 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:05:01.069
 then we go back to the but is 

00:04:52.549 --> 00:05:05.599
 on it and look us once the 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:07.339
 command here jb here is jbh but 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.929
 if you do that 1 it works 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.259
 not there is ever the first bank 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:16.239
 you jg likes to keep general 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:22.249
 then all commands come first jg 

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:24.399
 We were dry at first global then 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.679
 select the block 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:29.629
 jb block we want now in the case 

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:31.419
 can do with every block but we 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:34.759
 want now in the case 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:39.110
 sponge so sponge so take 19 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:41.839
 so there is now jb block blog 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.469
 but actually need to effect 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:47.119
 mallorca effect then look for us 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.459
 here one block would need 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:54.769
 I would say is the time now 

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:59.899
 only with end but after the reload must 

00:05:54.769 --> 00:06:02.179
 her the amount and the effect again 

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:04.969
 I re-enter that too in the bug 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.739
 but that's not so bad so 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:10.610
 the blog looks good too then sit down 

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:14.539
 I'm on blog and up 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.409
 medium so on medium but that's also 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:22.519
 not bad 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:24.860
 we still do on medium yes and then 

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:31.519
 we have actually set everything 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:33.110
 then we'll go on it so very cool 

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:39.349
 we can do that a little bit higher 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:43.519
 do it well so I like the plug-in 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:45.409
 clearly better and as a small proof 

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:50.899
 lama I'll go short here with my 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:53.169
 second count this year and you see 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.729
 I have no panic 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:59.240
 added or I have no op 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:02.240
 nothing as you can see here and is 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.320
 still works so brilliant the plug ins 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.650
 not really great 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.070
 the links are definitely in the 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:15.080
 video description also to the 3.0 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:19.850
 version of jump blogs so I would 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.860
 If you are a small private we look forward 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:26.210
 look at the config for a moment 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:38.810
 but that too is not that much shorter 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:40.850
 config an of blogs oh yes that's the one 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.130
 3.0 version is probably created 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.640
 no conflicts but that's not the case 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.460
 bad 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.650
 everything works fine i would like me 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.720
 via a feedback or a rating 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.210
 looking forward 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.510
 Subscription costs nothing so we 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.080
 See you next time because skin 

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.080
 purely
