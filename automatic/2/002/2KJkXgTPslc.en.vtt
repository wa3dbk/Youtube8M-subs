00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
heart tank and trust me we're going to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.459 
heart tank and trust me we're going to
need<00:02:31.099> those<00:02:31.249> as<00:02:31.579> much<00:02:31.969> as<00:02:32.150> possible<00:02:33.879> now<00:02:35.469> up

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
need those as much as possible now up

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:43.869 
need those as much as possible now up
here<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:41.530> chest<00:02:42.530> piece<00:02:42.739> but<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.579> need<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
here is the chest piece but we need the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.940 
here is the chest piece but we need the
gravity<00:02:44.299> well<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.599> do<00:02:44.689> that<00:02:44.719> so<00:02:45.319> we<00:02:45.530> can't<00:02:45.769> do

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
gravity well to do that so we can't do

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.879 
gravity well to do that so we can't do
it<00:02:46.099> yet<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:51.049> i<00:02:51.079> probably<00:02:51.379> could<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.650> gotten

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
it yet so i probably could have gotten

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.649 
it yet so i probably could have gotten
the<00:02:52.159> Ravel<00:02:52.639> because<00:02:52.819> i<00:02:52.909> think<00:02:52.969> its<00:02:53.299> weakness

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
the Ravel because i think its weakness

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:02.680 
the Ravel because i think its weakness
is<00:02:53.870> neon<00:02:54.260> tiger

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.540 

I'm<00:03:03.260> really<00:03:03.560> hope<00:03:03.800> light<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.160> at<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> fight

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
I'm really hope light on at the fight

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.030 
I'm really hope light on at the fight
bit<00:03:04.790> here

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.230 

oh<00:03:11.180> lucky<00:03:12.180> day

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.330 

okay<00:03:19.110> now<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.590> got<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.710> get<00:03:19.890> through<00:03:19.950> this

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
okay now we just got to get through this

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.740 
okay now we just got to get through this
in<00:03:20.520> sort<00:03:21.240> of<00:03:21.420> maze<00:03:23.210> is<00:03:24.210> there<00:03:24.360> something<00:03:24.630> down

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
in sort of maze is there something down

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:37.520 
in sort of maze is there something down
there

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.170 

I<00:03:37.620> think<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> actual<00:03:38.700> way<00:03:39.060> I'm

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
I think this is the actual way I'm

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
it's almost impossible except for maybe

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.610 
it's almost impossible except for maybe
some<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.800> later<00:04:19.950> ones<00:04:20.250> like<00:04:20.520> gone<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:21.140> X<00:04:22.140> 4

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
some of the later ones like gone on X 4

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.390 
some of the later ones like gone on X 4
and<00:04:23.160> stuff<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:23.730> now<00:04:24.590> his<00:04:25.590> weakness<00:04:26.130> is

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400

the<00:04:27.150> drill<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:28.560> think<00:04:28.980> I'm<00:04:29.760> able<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.360> do<00:04:30.480> it

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
the drill and I think I'm able to do it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.210 
the drill and I think I'm able to do it
because<00:04:30.630> i<00:04:30.780> have<00:04:30.930> another<00:04:31.170> energy<00:04:31.410> tank<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
because i have another energy tank and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.760 
because i have another energy tank and
he<00:04:35.310> isn't<00:04:35.460> too<00:04:35.730> hard<00:04:36.000> he<00:04:36.570> kind<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.870> glitches<00:04:37.500> up

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
he isn't too hard he kind of glitches up

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.890 
he isn't too hard he kind of glitches up

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
when you hit him with the flip da tank I

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:55.470 
when you hit him with the flip da tank I
mean<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:41.030> fang<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.900> that
