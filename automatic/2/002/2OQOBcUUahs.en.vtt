to<00:01:00.640> have<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.820> certain<00:01:01.270> style

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.200 

so<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.630> example<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.070> have

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so for example if I want to have

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.190 
so for example if I want to have
there's<00:01:09.780> some<00:01:09.990> text<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.630> color<00:01:12.870> of<00:01:13.020> red

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
there's some text to be the color of red

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.460 
there's some text to be the color of red
I<00:01:13.620> can<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.370> do<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.730> color

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.459 

and<00:01:18.920> remember<00:01:19.370> to

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
and remember to

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.410 
and remember to
do<00:01:21.009> semicolon<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.149> end<00:01:22.749> your<00:01:23.560> rules<00:01:24.210> okay<00:01:25.210> or

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
do semicolon to end your rules okay or

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.490 
do semicolon to end your rules okay or
else<00:01:25.569> it's<00:01:25.899> gonna<00:01:26.109> give<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.469> error<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
else it's gonna give you error and just

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
else it's gonna give you error and just
save<00:01:29.740> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
save it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.580 
save it
and<00:01:31.020> preview<00:01:31.620> in<00:01:31.800> browser

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850 

and<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.460> get

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.270 

so<00:01:42.460> some<00:01:42.790> text<00:01:43.180> is<00:01:43.750> read

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
so some text is read

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.300 
so some text is read
it's<00:01:45.730> really<00:01:45.940> amazing

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.700 

so<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.360> have

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.569 

let's<00:01:55.160> say<00:01:55.400> down<00:01:55.850> here<00:01:56.410> more<00:01:57.410> text

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.450 

the<00:02:00.850> more<00:02:01.119> text<00:02:01.539> would<00:02:02.380> actually<00:02:02.859> be<00:02:03.070> black

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
the more text would actually be black

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.700 
the more text would actually be black
which<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.689> default<00:02:04.899> style<00:02:05.380> for<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
which is the default style for the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.339 
which is the default style for the
browser

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.869 

refresh<00:02:12.090> see<00:02:13.090> because<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.749> not<00:02:14.019> inside<00:02:14.499> if

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
refresh see because it's not inside if

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.809 
refresh see because it's not inside if
we've<00:02:15.879> specified<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.870> rule<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> div<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
we've specified a rule for the div to

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.789 
we've specified a rule for the div to
have<00:02:19.030> all<00:02:19.209> their<00:02:19.389> text<00:02:19.810> colors<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.439> be<00:02:20.590> read

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
have all their text colors to be read

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:21.600 
have all their text colors to be read
but

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
but

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.750 
but
the<00:02:21.820> text<00:02:22.180> outside<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.960> any<00:02:23.140> tapes<00:02:23.470> okay<00:02:24.520> or<00:02:24.730> a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
the text outside of any tapes okay or a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.910 
the text outside of any tapes okay or a
text<00:02:25.060> nap<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.900> are<00:02:26.020> not<00:02:26.430> inside<00:02:27.430> India<00:02:27.790> this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
text nap that are not inside India this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.770 
text nap that are not inside India this
okay

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
okay

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
okay
so<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:32.000> setting<00:02:33.000> up

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
so that's setting up

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.170 
so that's setting up
text<00:02:34.570> colors<00:02:34.930> font<00:02:35.590> colors<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.610> simply<00:02:36.970> do

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
text colors font colors just simply do

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.280 
text colors font colors just simply do
color<00:02:37.540> :<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.100> color<00:02:39.450> name<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.780> then

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
color : in the color name and then

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.930 
color : in the color name and then
semicolon<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.880> can<00:02:43.030> actually<00:02:43.210> do

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.110 

the<00:02:48.390> hex<00:02:49.110> code<00:02:49.440> -<00:02:49.830> which<00:02:50.250> starts<00:02:50.580> with<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the hex code - which starts with the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.119 
the hex code - which starts with the
pound<00:02:51.360> sign<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.860> too

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
pound sign and you can too

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.750 
pound sign and you can too
zero<00:02:54.879> zero<00:02:55.269> zero<00:02:55.540> zero

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
zero zero zero zero

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.970 
zero zero zero zero
it's<00:02:58.750> always<00:02:59.019> six<00:02:59.409> digit<00:02:59.830> number

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.729 

all<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.550> six<00:03:03.819> digits<00:03:04.239> compose

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
all of the six digits compose

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.610 
all of the six digits compose
it's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
it's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.670 
it's
they<00:03:09.250> all<00:03:09.400> represent<00:03:09.610> different<00:03:10.360> color<00:03:11.349> codes

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
they all represent different color codes

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.880 
they all represent different color codes
okay<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.480> let's<00:03:13.629> see<00:03:13.810> what<00:03:13.959> we<00:03:14.080> get<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.620> zero

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
okay so let's see what we get the zero

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.030 
okay so let's see what we get the zero
zero<00:03:15.190> zero<00:03:15.310> zero<00:03:15.610> nine<00:03:15.909> nine<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.980> is

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
zero zero zero nine nine this is

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.750 
zero zero zero nine nine this is
supposed<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.700> be<00:03:18.879> blue

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
supposed to be blue

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.180 
supposed to be blue
spanked<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.840> browser

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
spanked that the browser

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.020 
spanked that the browser
