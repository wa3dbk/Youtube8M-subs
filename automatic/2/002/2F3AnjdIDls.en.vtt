00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.930
 the company to the gps entity as promised has released version two 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.719
 0 points of uica something 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.069
 your great speed camera warder for iphone 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.990
 that takes the data of deep green rada and three points 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.359
 When you start the program, the first thing you do is connect with the servers 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.739
 of gps art where are a copy of the black rada of this point of interest 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:30.880
 points 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 to pass them to the team 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.420
 as we can observe 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.420
 the interfering of the program have radically changed 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.479
 on top 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:47.029
 we see how many cars and in what range of kilometers they are reporting 

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:49.440
 real-time bingo 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.220
 dfefe traffic incidents coffee radars in the example screen we see 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.510
 that there are four cars in a range of 45 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.200
 a car at the bottom 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.929
 they do not say how much their members the gps alert system 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.610
 exists at this time 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 the pil we will be talking about almost half a million years 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.520
 as we see 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 the speed indicator has changed by one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 with digital segment 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020
 and the screen in general 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 since a much more modern and attractive group 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.660
 by clicking on the icon of the basins in the lower right corner 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.090
 from the screen 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.990
 let's go to the screen 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.920
 d configuration 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 we must first three voters that will tell us if we want a sound when 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.990
 we approach fixed radars to mobile radars fourth time live that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 we remember only that they notify with other drivers 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.720
 we also have the option 3 sea mount that does not produce sound of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.479
 warning if we go at least 20 kilometers 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.100
 Olvera below the war limit 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 also on this screen we can control the volume 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.040
 of the notices 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.600
 and if we want to enter the live radar system or not 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.260
 if we turn the screen 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.790
 we will see an indicator to activate or deactivate the vibration apart from 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.239
 sound when we approach a radar 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.339
 an indicator for 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:19.429
 say if we want to automatically update the database of 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.849
 radars and we see that it is updated in this case on July 9 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:28.469
 and then a series of sectors where he will give us help information about 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.099
 every cure of the things that incidentally the events of the program 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:37.679
 we can get information on marmots are the global icons in 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:38.779
 I live and that they are 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.610
 does not extinguish itself thing that they circulate 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.879
 around us who report the orotava is live 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.189
 i each screen about where are the information about the manufacturer of the 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.549
 Program 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.749
 let's go now to see the three types and warned that our warning will not be 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.309
 of radars whose charge 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.269
 the first in the black point 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.279
 that will appear with this symbol that appears on the screen 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:07.869
 indicated as always the distance to the black point a black point like all 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.539
 we know 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:12.060
 It is an area of ​​special relevance in traffic where there has been 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.479
 a higher incidence of accidents 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.379
 the next diego are mobile radars 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.409
 that does not identify it with that wave symbol 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.519
 but it also tells us how often they assist the police there 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.329
 closed with two for three stars 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.239
 or as symbols indicates the distance the speed of the radar in this case 120 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.339
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:39.429
 and if we equal to overcome the speed marked by the radar 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.769
 the law the confidence indicator looks red 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.019
 instead of the normal black this means that we are linking above 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.599
 of the recommended speed 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.630
 by last 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.539
 we have fixed radars 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.869
 that indicate us with that symbol 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:59.709
 tells us the distance wings to the radar the speed recommended in the 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.539
 example 80 kilometers per hour 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:06.149
 i in the example screen we see that this 53 that our current speed 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:10.119
 appears with the black background because it exceeds the speed indicated by the 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.359
 fixed radar 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.650
 if at any time we press the huilango screen 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.650
 this selection menu appears 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.430
 where we see that we can report a live radar either fixed mobile or a 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.990
 traffic accident any event that we want to report 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.449
 for this we will click 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.110
 on the corresponding date will indy the cinemas in my own sense or in the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.259
 contrary have found this event 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.780
 this event will be notified to all the team with care 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.419
 ohb-system forward gps 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.389
 have the warning system activated 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.430
 of radar the peak 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.760
 conclusion 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.060
 say that I alerted gps 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.509
 excelled with a tango overcome two points 0 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.449
 it has infinitely improved the aspect of the application one thing that we already said 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.949
 that should make the first million 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.300
 he has shown us 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.430
 in red 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.879
 when we are above 100 km / h 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.699
 has perfected the display screen in vigo 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.939
 and in general the program works with a fluency 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.110
 very superior 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.900
 i efe 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.180
 we always have 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.710
 the advantage that if using each point of interest point parent 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.300
 that yes we came down from the vulcano servers themselves 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.400
 which is one of the most complete radars databases in Spain 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.310
 we can therefore say 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.680
 that alert gps has outdone itself 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.860
 and also has fulfilled his word because he promised that the version 2 points 0 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.309
 it would also be free for iphone users 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.629
 thank you very much to all
