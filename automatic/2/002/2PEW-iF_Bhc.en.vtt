think that you know grinding the extra

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.390 
think that you know grinding the extra
15<00:01:23.700> procedures<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.960> worth<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.740> whatsoever

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
15 procedures is not worth it whatsoever

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
15 procedures is not worth it whatsoever
so<00:01:27.090> uh<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> option<00:01:28.979> once<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> hit
