00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.170
 Welcome to a for speed 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.430
 review again in old times 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.440
 because I have no reviews for a long time 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.210
 I have a lot of let's now 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.990
 Play offs and so on 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.550
 and so on I have eternity now 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.580
 situation in the autonomous and indeed 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.800
 with the mazda rx 8 of 2009 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.510
 it was already some time ago as 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.480
 Gift but not in the police 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.949
 version and now or today believes or 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.499
 He came out yesterday 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.829
 need for speed world i just got 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:46.089
 bought just because I'm pretty 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.390
 think cool and definitely hornier 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:55.539
 finance rx 8 to the car this is a 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.749
 that's the mazda rx 8 2009 has one 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.969
 Appreciation of 549 in the 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:06.520
 top speed 507 in the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:09.420
 acceleration 679 and handling 1461 the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.159
 has the normal race parts in it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.249
 as I always say the 7th 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.539
 In any case I can still share 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:18.840
 I still have to upgrade I have 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.250
 but not done yet 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.219
 now i even bought a car in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 a video 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:30.050
 that's why we're leaving immediately 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 hide out 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.280
 one calls it here I believe 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.620
 base earlier in the Alps something 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.530
 good 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.830
 1 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.840
 so if we give gas 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.980
 it's a very good feeling so 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.780
 you drive away 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.440
 off and on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.440
 right up to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.950
 we'll do ours again 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.040
 as in old times, I say 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.850
 times 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.550
 Guests make millions of straight so 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.550
 phone you're never more 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.500
 the car creates 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.160
 By the way, who is still interested in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.780
 gates or who should need one 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.190
 just write I keep writing 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.900
 Movie 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.799
 the link of the friend who does that 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.799
 I look like described below 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.770
 I think that's almost all 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.319
 big fan 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.319
 that is expression 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.439
 because I'm with right now 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.500
 at 292 is then circuit occurs 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.600
 also 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.480
 kicker what all police cars 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.260
 meanwhile 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.260
 as light 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.550
 mostly irritates both 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:27.330
 so that 's it for the mazda rx 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.230
 8 of 2009 as a mean thumb high and 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.230
