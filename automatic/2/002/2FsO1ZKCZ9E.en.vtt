00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
in there really well so right now that's

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.590 
in there really well so right now that's
as<00:01:48.619> much<00:01:48.740> space<00:01:49.009> i<00:01:49.280> would<00:01:49.520> say<00:01:49.869> if<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.829> have

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
as much space i would say if you have

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.060 
as much space i would say if you have
more<00:01:53.600> than<00:01:53.659> one<00:01:53.930> extra<00:01:54.409> lens<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.710> might<00:01:54.860> carry

more than one extra lens you might carry

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.230 
more than one extra lens you might carry
around<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.549> don't<00:01:55.729> think<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:55.970> would<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.119> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
around I don't think this would be the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.690 
around I don't think this would be the
right<00:01:56.329> bag<00:01:56.540> but<00:01:57.409> there's<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.220> decent<00:01:58.369> amount<00:01:58.520> of

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
right bag but there's a decent amount of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.370 
right bag but there's a decent amount of
space<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.540> for<00:01:59.689> day-to-day<00:01:59.840> use<00:02:00.229> which

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
space and just for day-to-day use which

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.620 
space and just for day-to-day use which
is<00:02:00.500> what<00:02:00.649> i<00:02:00.680> use<00:02:00.829> my<00:02:01.130> camera<00:02:01.399> for<00:02:01.729> i<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.540> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
is what i use my camera for i think and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.819 
is what i use my camera for i think and
be<00:02:02.689> really<00:02:02.899> good<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:03.380> if<00:02:03.439> you're<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.649> going

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
around taking pictures of your kid at

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.389 
around taking pictures of your kid at
like<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.360> park<00:02:05.630> or<00:02:05.899> for<00:02:06.829> instance<00:02:07.130> today<00:02:07.280> I'm

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
like the park or for instance today I'm

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
like the park or for instance today I'm
going<00:02:07.579> to<00:02:07.670> take<00:02:07.790> pictures<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.239> my<00:02:08.649> college

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
going to take pictures of my college

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.619 
going to take pictures of my college
graduate<00:02:10.160> friends<00:02:10.489> on<00:02:10.579> the<00:02:10.670> quad<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.239> think

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
graduate friends on the quad I think

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.479 
graduate friends on the quad I think
it'd<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.750> really<00:02:11.930> good<00:02:12.110> used<00:02:12.520> but<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:14.660> sum<00:02:14.840> up

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
it'd be really good used but to sum up

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.290 
it'd be really good used but to sum up
