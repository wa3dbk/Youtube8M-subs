00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
of the gel liner and I would just start

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:50.480 
of the gel liner and I would just start
in<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.450> center<00:01:37.869> of<00:01:37.900> my<00:01:38.260> eye

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and then go into the middle but you can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.300 
and then go into the middle but you can
master<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.790> hand<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.690> your<00:01:55.080> cheek<00:01:58.070> like<00:01:59.070> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
nicely it goes on quite nicely by itself

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.520 
nicely it goes on quite nicely by itself
I<00:02:14.340> find<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> liquid<00:02:15.780> ones<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.350> need

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
I find with the liquid ones you do need

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.559 
I find with the liquid ones you do need
to<00:02:16.650> stretch<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.430> fine<00:02:17.700> line<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
to stretch to get that fine line and

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.809 
to stretch to get that fine line and
that<00:02:18.840> straight<00:02:19.230> line<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.790> don't

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
that straight line and really you don't

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.110 
that straight line and really you don't
want<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.270> stretching<00:02:21.600> your<00:02:22.200> eyelids<00:02:23.120> well

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
want to be stretching your eyelids well

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.400 
want to be stretching your eyelids well
you<00:02:24.239> want<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.480> stretching<00:02:24.780> them<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:25.200> little

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
you want to be stretching them as little

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.560 
you want to be stretching them as little
as<00:02:25.560> possible<00:02:25.739> because<00:02:26.160> stretching<00:02:26.790> them<00:02:26.940> will

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
as possible because stretching them will

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.550 
as possible because stretching them will
introduce<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> wrinkles<00:02:28.410> quicker<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.320> just

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
introduce the wrinkles quicker so just

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.229 
introduce the wrinkles quicker so just
give<00:02:31.739> yourself<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.160> nice<00:02:32.310> fine<00:02:32.640> line<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
give yourself a nice fine line like that

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.509 
give yourself a nice fine line like that
and<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> want<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.800> add<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.160> flick

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
and if you want to add a little flick

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.310 
and if you want to add a little flick
then<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.239> do<00:02:36.300> find<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.019> better<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
then I do find that it's better to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.380 
then I do find that it's better to
stretch<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:39.000> you're<00:02:39.180> doing<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> flick<00:02:41.390> but

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
stretch when you're doing the flick but

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.910 
stretch when you're doing the flick but
if<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.600> can<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> babe<00:02:43.110> aside<00:02:43.410> if<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:43.739> all

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
if you can get a babe aside if then all

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.860 
if you can get a babe aside if then all
the<00:02:44.040> batter<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:44.970> try<00:02:45.180> not<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.600> stretch

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the batter if you can try not to stretch

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.059 
the batter if you can try not to stretch
your<00:02:46.110> eyes<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.620> all<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.850> press

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069

add<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.310> tiny<00:02:59.670> flick<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.440> big<00:03:01.440> flicks<00:03:01.709> are

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
add a tiny flick because big flicks are

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.710 
add a tiny flick because big flicks are
really<00:03:02.370> they<00:03:02.640> really<00:03:02.880> are<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.180> young<00:03:03.329> people

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
really they really are for young people
