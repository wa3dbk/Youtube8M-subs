00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi all guys were helpful 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.920
 cycling here full video in which you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.109
 I'll talk about some robbery news 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 in the bank of online trips and then on 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.010
 its expansion is in this scan 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.380
 we will have seven new vehicles when 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 just the bank robberies will come out and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 in this video I will show you in addition to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.779
 the names of these alleys also theirs 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 possible images and all of them 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.109
 details before starting the memories 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.519
 to leave me like it also because there 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.960
 it also only takes two seconds 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.400
 subscribe to the channel for others 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.449
 contents and I would say we can 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.609
 start right away 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.500
 in truth among the seven little ones there was already 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.630
 an announced overall happens in which rome 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 of which we also have pictures already 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 always released by the rock star 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.100
 as for the others 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 these vehicles have been discovered 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 instead from a modder in the patch more 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 recently the names of these vehicles are 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.930
 vinca enduro helmet lamps p 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.379
 guardian xvi ai insurgent dear in curve 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.719
 karin prinzi plettro technician as 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.850
 these codes are in the same we say 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.739
 folder where the scale in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.859
 koroma vehicle announced by the rock star 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.750
 these will come out together with karin 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.600
 kourou but in the same expansion or true 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.909
 that of bank robberies we pass 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 now to the images of these vehicles 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 let's go straight to karin crua because 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.049
 precisely miccoli now shown by 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.520
 rockstar 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.659
 these are the images of this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.330
 vehicle and we can note a certain 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.369
 resemblance to the most fsa code it is 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 an armored vehicle made for 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.570
 robbing banks always passing 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.360
 vehicles belonging to the hull we have 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.310
 then the technical and technical karin o 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.159
 vehicles for the English would be a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.900
 vehicle created for military clashes 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.299
 with objects on these vehicles 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.340
 able to perform fights 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.890
 offensive then in short to shoot 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.780
 something like missile bullets 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.939
 explosives etc. and so on and so on is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 precisely one of these objects for 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.850
 example may be a submachine gun 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.130
 so we can think of this vehicle 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.350
 that you are seeing right now in the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 video is that we have also seen in 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.670
 trailer even if the image is anyway 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 is shown now in this video 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.060
 would be a screenshot released always 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.770
 from the rock star, however you can 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.530
 see this alley even in the trailer 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.420
 bank robbery is true it says 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.310
 rebel but I remind you that in any case the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.259
 technical word is more of a way 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.980
 to describe vehicle rather than 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.599
 give them a title then 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.390
 likely exit title of the vehicle 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.549
 it will be expensive in technical once 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.980
 the expansion will also be output as 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.220
 we know the rebel belongs to caries 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.470
 passing instead to the dinka enduro instead 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.269
 as we know, the tench su gta produces 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.280
 usually motorcycles 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.260
 ignoring the jester dinka case 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.629
 jester then if we translate the word 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.569
 enduro we can translate it as a race of 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.950
 resistance and usually motorcycles 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.420
 those classified as enduro are those 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.940
 bikes capable of going astray 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 so we can think of vehicles like 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.870
 for example a perfect motocross in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.620
 this case to link it with the name 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.620
 of the vehicle 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.299
 we pass instead to the fbi insorgenti of 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.549
 not much is known about this alley though 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.620
 we know that at least xvi ai su gta 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.349
 it would practically be an industry that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.620
 produces heavy vehicles we also have a 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.609
 vehicle with the name and to the subjects 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.950
 at 5 as also on the previous one we have 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:12.220
 other types of vehicles always with this one 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.349
 short action then in short this 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.569
 vehicle could still be treated 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.599
 of a heavy vehicle however it is a 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.700
 military truck as you have also seen 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.440
 in the video this vehicle could be 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.760
 like the vehicles you've just seen 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.099
 in the video there is then a heavy vehicle in the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.389
 trailer so we can whole think 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.650
 to this vehicle you are seeing 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.049
 always in the video and we'll see something 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.579
 never will this be the behind source 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.200
 passing instead to the helmet lamp 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.120
 we have no idea what it is though 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.280
 we know that there are more or less vehicles 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.019
 sports lights in the category of lamps 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.480
 it could be a sports vehicle 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.720
 armored or whatever it is is 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.389
 also linked to its security in 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.549
 how much is connected with the word helmet e 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.530
 we know what a helmet is obviously in 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.000
 how much the rock star has entered this 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.859
 Italian word 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.690
 then we have the avap the guardian who 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.940
 could this vehicle be like 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.349
 even this helicopter though these 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.359
 vehicles are quite difficult to 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.669
 guess or better guess theirs 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.560
 appearance obviously only from the name 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.479
 finally we have the prince i pluck pro that 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.190
 as written in the files it would look like one 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.070
 motorcycle even if we don't know for 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.930
 nothing its appearance and there are none 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.820
 other news you can also check 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.370
 this file thanks to the app 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.440
 to the fruit I will obviously leave the name of the 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.130
 file as well as the source treated in 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.440
 this video 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.630

 you can also check if there is or 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 minus this file though it is anyway 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.020
 many people have confirmed the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.180
 presence of this file 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.280
