00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
phone so this is the first one some kind

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.420 
phone so this is the first one some kind
of<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.969> water<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.430> let's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
of them is that water I think so let's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.479 
of them is that water I think so let's
go<00:00:53.579> back<00:00:54.710> well<00:00:55.879> okay<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> second<00:00:57.960> one

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.580 

and<00:01:03.409> then<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.710> guess<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> pretty<00:01:06.060> nice

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
and then I guess it is a pretty nice

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
and then I guess it is a pretty nice
this<00:01:07.590> looks<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.310> smoke<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.510> sure<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this looks like smoke I'm not sure I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.880 
this looks like smoke I'm not sure I
stuff<00:01:09.990> water<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.450> may<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.510> wrong

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
stuff water I think so I may be wrong

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.630 
stuff water I think so I may be wrong
and<00:01:14.990> then<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.280> border

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and then we also have here some border

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.420 
and then we also have here some border
thing<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.299> guess<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:18.990> mountains<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
thing I guess some mountains this is the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.060

this one is also pretty cool a pyramid
here<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.990> we<00:02:17.990> don't<00:02:18.020> know<00:02:18.320> how<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.530> build<00:02:18.830> us

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
here and we don't know how to build us

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.900 
here and we don't know how to build us
or<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.520> think<00:02:19.970> at<00:02:20.090> least<00:02:20.240> nobody<00:02:20.870> knows<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:22.370> it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
or I think at least nobody knows but it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.980 
or I think at least nobody knows but it
was<00:02:23.120> heavy<00:02:23.390> work<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:24.320> was<00:02:24.530> heavy<00:02:24.740> work<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.690> move

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
was heavy work it was heavy work to move

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.810 
was heavy work it was heavy work to move
up<00:02:27.170> those<00:02:27.410> stones<00:02:27.800> because<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.490> were<00:02:28.550> heavy

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
up those stones because they were heavy

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.240 
up those stones because they were heavy
and<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.350> have<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.590> one<00:02:30.800> definite

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
and then we have this one definite

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.710 
and then we have this one definite
definite<00:02:31.640> difference<00:02:31.880> one<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.540> more

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
definite difference one of the more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.200 
definite difference one of the more
nicer<00:02:32.960> one<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.590> think<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.460> like<00:02:34.670> Grand

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
nicer one I think it's this like Grand

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.420 
nicer one I think it's this like Grand
Canyon<00:02:35.720> or<00:02:35.840> something<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.560> u.s.<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.400> think

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
Canyon or something in the u.s. I think

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.890 
Canyon or something in the u.s. I think
so<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:40.160> very<00:02:40.400> dangerous<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:41.300> don't

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
so and it's very dangerous you don't

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.550 
so and it's very dangerous you don't
want<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.170> fall<00:02:42.350> down<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:43.370> careful<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.120> you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
want to fall down so be careful if you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.070 
want to fall down so be careful if you
get<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.800> place<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.480> yeah<00:02:47.570> as<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.930> said

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
get to that place and but yeah as I said

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.660 
get to that place and but yeah as I said
I<00:02:48.290> will<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.710> my<00:02:48.860> position<00:02:49.220> if<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.370> want<00:02:49.580> to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
I will have my position if you want to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.220 
I will have my position if you want to
check<00:02:49.880> them<00:02:50.090> out<00:02:50.210> I<00:02:50.830> also<00:02:51.830> probably<00:02:52.310> will
