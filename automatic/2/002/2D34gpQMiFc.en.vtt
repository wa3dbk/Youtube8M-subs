00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
 second surprise this morning is an old friend portrayed at the door 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.020
 stand what says 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.840
 it still has 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.530
 Career at that thought I also have my last trip through the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.599
 Arctic met 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.819
 Neustadt before the election from water 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:18.240
 Ibbenbüren Westerkappeln picked up the ILO and drowned everything 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.110
 the WestImmo are very hospitable people 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.110
 He even offered me his one wife offer 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.119
 what stands out is the Modern comes to visit as for example with you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.640
 of course we expect the same hospitality this 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.840
 but of course 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.089
 Wettberg 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.640
 Friedberg way 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.920
 That's exactly what I mean, maybe I needed a sip of wine 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.430
 Mayor I promised that if he ever joined us 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.089
 Then you would kill yourself and Nia 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.160
 however, it does not really make it easy for me 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.050
 this is definitely not the fourth FC Lok this year and us 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.609
 have luck trend more and more 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.780
 to make the team as stable 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.190
 it's about a matter of honor I mean is already hungover anyway 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.500
 because the son of a western directions da Silva then show you 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.320
 but you do not have a single Wayne has a dereliction of duty by the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.750
 high energy requirement of the French procedure I know it already in the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.970
 he's what I ever scared the most in corporations 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.900
 Thanks to the clear Hannover Re I like the finds certainly quite acceptable 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.850
 that will not do 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.300
 Robert de Niro 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.970
 and it is my goal and give something 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 Ulmer others 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 So I am suggesting myself today 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 I leave you now «with our team spirit 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 yes the sheet 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.120
 Dietmar Roth 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.300
 one after 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.270
 if tourists finished 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 the company and operated 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 Dr 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.950
 Yes
