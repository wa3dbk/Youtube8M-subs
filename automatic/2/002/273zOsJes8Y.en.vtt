strange I think it's all very odd and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
strange I think it's all very odd and
it's<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.359> arbitrary<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.740> such<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> funny

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
slightly I'd flip back and forth and I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
slightly I'd flip back and forth and I
put<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> different<00:00:55.829> hat<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.579> would<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.850> it

put on a different hat and I would do it
but<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.170> feel<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.129> over<00:00:59.730> time<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.300> started

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
but I do feel like over time I started

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.990 
but I do feel like over time I started
to<00:01:00.960> realize<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.620> wasn't<00:01:01.920> quite<00:01:02.340> clear<00:01:02.609> as

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to realize that I wasn't quite clear as

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
to realize that I wasn't quite clear as
to<00:01:03.239> where<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> belonged<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> ever<00:01:05.070> been

been in deep trouble I've been really I

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.280 
been in deep trouble I've been really I
was<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.350> most<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.950> trouble<00:01:41.400> after<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.899> had<00:01:43.140> my

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
was the most in trouble after I had my

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.950 
was the most in trouble after I had my
first<00:01:43.439> daughter<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.880> doing<00:01:45.390> anything

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
first daughter but not doing anything

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
first daughter but not doing anything
just<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.470> life<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.159> trouble<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.909> think

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
just my life was in trouble and I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.490 
just my life was in trouble and I think
that<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.509> something<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.320> don't

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that that's something you don't

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.149 
that that's something you don't
necessarily<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> miss<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
necessarily want to miss out on is

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.170 
necessarily want to miss out on is
feeling<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> feels<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.149> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
feeling what it feels like to be in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
feeling what it feels like to be in
trouble<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.600> being<00:01:54.780> wrong<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.560> being

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
trouble and being wrong really being

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.179 
trouble and being wrong really being
wrong<00:01:55.920> by<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.729> own<00:01:56.850> hand<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:58.189> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wrong by your own hand and the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.859 
wrong by your own hand and the
consequences<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.719> it's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
consequences of it I think it's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.840 
consequences of it I think it's
important<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.409> feel<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.460> idea<00:02:02.820> of

a<00:02:32.010> way<00:02:32.250> forward<00:02:33.620> because<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.740> must<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.010> had

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
a way forward because you must have had

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
I think that there always is I think

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.080 
I think that there always is I think
that<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.680> may<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.550> thought
