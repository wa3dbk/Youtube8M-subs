from something that was on paper a

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.090 
from something that was on paper a
concept<00:06:45.990> and<00:06:46.380> we've<00:06:46.560> turned<00:06:46.800> it<00:06:46.980> into

concept and we've turned it into

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.910 
concept and we've turned it into
something<00:06:47.610> real<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:48.300> soon<00:06:49.140> it<00:06:49.560> will<00:06:49.620> be<00:06:49.830> in

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920
