00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
learned though at first I started with

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.969 
learned though at first I started with
cold<00:01:28.270> water<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.600> put<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.960> jars<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.500> jam<00:01:29.740> in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
there and then brought it up to a simmer

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.050 
there and then brought it up to a simmer
well<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.039> not<00:01:33.310> what<00:01:33.369> you're<00:01:33.729> supposed<00:01:33.850> to

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
well that is not what you're supposed to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.090 
well that is not what you're supposed to
do<00:01:34.180> with<00:01:34.299> Jam<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:34.899> if<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.170> actually<00:01:35.829> cook

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
do with Jam and if you actually cook

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.749 
do with Jam and if you actually cook
pectin<00:01:36.579> too<00:01:36.820> long<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:38.020> jam<00:01:38.829> will<00:01:39.100> break<00:01:39.340> apart

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
pectin too long the jam will break apart

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.580 
pectin too long the jam will break apart
and<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.149> won't<00:01:40.390> set<00:01:40.899> unless<00:01:41.110> it's<00:01:41.409> in<00:01:41.500> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
and it won't set unless it's in the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.550 
and it won't set unless it's in the
refrigerator<00:01:42.189> so<00:01:42.789> this<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.450> learned<00:01:43.960> that<00:01:44.259> yes

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420
