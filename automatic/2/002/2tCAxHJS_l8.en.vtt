00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this first term there are power-ups it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.970 
this first term there are power-ups it's
kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> mario<00:00:35.790> kart<00:00:36.090> s<00:00:36.360> power<00:00:36.989> system

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
kind of like a mario kart s power system

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of stuff all together this one I just

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
of stuff all together this one I just
pick<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.330> called<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> shockwave

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
pick up here is called the shockwave

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
pick up here is called the shockwave
bethought<00:01:20.070> basically<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.000> anybody<00:01:21.360> comes

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
bethought basically if anybody comes

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
bethought basically if anybody comes
here<00:01:21.720> he's<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> ground<00:01:22.500> pound<00:01:22.830> if

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
here he's kind of like a ground pound if

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.350 
here he's kind of like a ground pound if
anybody's<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.850> slammed<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
anybody's in here they get slammed and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.109 
anybody's in here they get slammed and
thrown<00:01:24.630> away<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.119> speed

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
thrown away that one right there speed

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.620 
thrown away that one right there speed
boost<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.570> guess<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.710> self-explanatory<00:01:29.630> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
boost I guess when self-explanatory that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.179 
boost I guess when self-explanatory that
a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:31.140> symbol<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> bottom<00:01:31.860> means<00:01:32.040> I'm

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
a little symbol on the bottom means I'm

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
a little symbol on the bottom means I'm
being<00:01:32.400> tracked<00:01:32.790> by<00:01:33.030> heat-seeking<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:34.170> don't

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
being tracked by heat-seeking I don't

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
being tracked by heat-seeking I don't
know<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> call<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.280> missile<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
know you call it a missile not really a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.630 
know you call it a missile not really a
missile<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.439> energy<00:01:37.740> ball<00:01:37.890> once

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
missile kind of like an energy ball once

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
missile kind of like an energy ball once
again<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.060> comes<00:01:39.270> again<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> look<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
again here comes again and you look in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.770 
again here comes again and you look in

power<00:03:10.670> behind<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.900> which<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:12.530> like<00:03:12.769> if<00:03:12.920> you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
power behind you which is like if you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.530 
power behind you which is like if you
don't<00:03:13.220> need<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.550> but<00:03:13.730> that's<00:03:13.880> kind<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.330> silly

don't need it but that's kind of a silly
idea<00:03:14.750> because<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.470> gives<00:03:16.190> power<00:03:16.790> away<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
idea because it gives power away to the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.229 
idea because it gives power away to the
other<00:03:17.989> racers<00:03:18.769> which<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.730> kind<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.060> silly

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
other racers which is kind of a silly

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.140 
other racers which is kind of a silly
idea<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:21.800> one<00:03:22.280> right<00:03:22.400> there<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.760> actually<00:03:23.090> a

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
idea that one right there is actually a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.990 
idea that one right there is actually a
heel<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.440> can<00:03:24.620> see<00:03:24.769> rate<00:03:25.010> above<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.850> river

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
heel if you can see rate above the river

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.570 
heel if you can see rate above the river
rate<00:03:26.300> below<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.660> rearview<00:03:26.930> mirror<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.580> take

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
rate below the rearview mirror I take

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.550 
rate below the rearview mirror I take
damage<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:29.360> can<00:03:29.480> peel<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.959> if<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.380> get

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
damage and you can peel that if you get

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.800 
damage and you can peel that if you get
rack<00:03:30.800> do<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.190> much<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:31.519> recently<00:03:32.090> you
