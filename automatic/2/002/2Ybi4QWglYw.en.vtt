00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 spectacular i have got me short 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.610
 but still decided to a gate 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.610

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:22.350
 the basic price with apples 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 currant juice where you can get them 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:34.350
 bit of coconut oil boiled up and the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.379
 tasted as next in any case 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 Being somehow energy-deep 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.979
 so at work in between, you hold 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.140
 that should make the bio or a few 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:40.170
 with agave syrup but even buy 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:47.689
 pieces of cocoa powder that the driver for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.990
 I made potato with potatoes 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.579

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.079
 second plate it really right 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.119
 really delicious so funny that though 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.439

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.310
 Slices of wholewheat left front wheel 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.830

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.060
 writer had been his so the 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.360
 You can not think of butter as my eyes 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.040
 butter denote like that is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.180
 rather as fresh as in neutral 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 as a newly seen here not even 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 do not taste good does not taste good 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.000
 be uncomfortable 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 unsightly consistency but agree as in 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.579
 freshly set i like but can as 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.610
 neutral and down and as 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.140
 humectant we leave immediately 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.549
 a bit of kids ketchup that's here 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.260
 as I said the industry, I hope so 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.590
 hungry again after the second evening 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.590
 eat
