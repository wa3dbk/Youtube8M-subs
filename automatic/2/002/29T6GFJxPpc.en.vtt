again this has been done let's see in a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.490 
again this has been done let's see in a
lot<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.350> animated<00:03:59.980> series<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.690> doesn't

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
lot of the animated series it doesn't

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.470 
lot of the animated series it doesn't
make<00:04:02.799> sense<00:04:02.859> if<00:04:03.519> you're<00:04:03.640> trying<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> say<00:04:04.420> you

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
make sense if you're trying to say you

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.030 
make sense if you're trying to say you
are<00:04:04.630> being<00:04:04.930> an<00:04:05.079> innovator<00:04:06.870> why<00:04:07.870> would<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:08.859> do

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
are being an innovator why would you do

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.280 
are being an innovator why would you do
something<00:04:09.310> like<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:10.510> that's<00:04:10.690> rich<00:04:10.959> that's

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
something like that that's rich that's

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.860 
something like that that's rich that's
just<00:04:11.560> stupid<00:04:11.859> Oh

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.499 

another<00:04:17.870> thing<00:04:18.139> is<00:04:18.319> is<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.729> you<00:04:19.729> can<00:04:20.000> take<00:04:20.269> out

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
another thing is is a you can take out

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.089 
another thing is is a you can take out
all<00:04:21.409> the<00:04:22.069> all<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.720> action<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:24.020> these<00:04:24.590> comics

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
all the all the action in these comics

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.839 
all the all the action in these comics
and<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:27.020> would<00:04:27.169> still<00:04:27.590> make<00:04:27.919> sense<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.430> be<00:04:28.819> a

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
and it would still make sense and be a

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.610 
and it would still make sense and be a
fluid<00:04:29.330> story<00:04:29.659> it<00:04:29.960> would<00:04:30.199> just<00:04:30.289> be<00:04:30.440> about

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
fluid story it would just be about

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.710 
fluid story it would just be about
something<00:04:31.009> completely<00:04:31.099> different<00:04:34.539> this<00:04:35.539> is

literally as a superhero comic that's

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.080 
literally as a superhero comic that's
