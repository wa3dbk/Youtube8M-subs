00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.670
 do not 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.210
 The first thing we are going to do to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.130
 to start our recipe is to take a saucepan 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.490
 water we will put strong fire 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.720
 and we will wait until it boils 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.280
 while the water is heated we go to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.470
 start from our ingredients 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.650
 we have washed the pumpkin and now what 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.430
 we go from large pieces to 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.290
 continuation 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.000
 we have taken the half onion we have 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.720
 removed what is the skin and now the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.429
 let's start in little pieces now 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 we will take the pepper arrived 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.130
 we will remove what the cloth does and what 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 let's also start like this 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.550
 then we will remove the skin to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.230
 our potatoes and once you get 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.480
 we have removed what we are going to do in 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 start investing them in large pieces 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.200
 It was once peeled our potatoes 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.239
 it's our carrot's turn to 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.650
 which we are also going to remove the skin 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.599
 and cut it into slices 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.370
 when the water is already boiling we are going to 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.930
 escape our tomato for it we're going to 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.110
 take it with a knife we ​​will do 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.970
 a pair of cross-shaped cuts and there 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.069
 goes this way let's insert the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.099
 tomato inside and we'll leave it during 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.019
 30 seconds once been in our 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.209
 tomato we can easily remove the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.159
 skin in this way we are pulling and see 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.359
 that comes out practically alone and once 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.760
 that nothing what we are going to do is 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.870
 cut it into cubes and do it next to 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.879
 rest of the ingredients 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.650
 Now let's take all the 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.959
 ingredients that we have chopped and what will 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.810
 process in a pan this way and 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.879
 that everything falls perfect now 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.599
 we are also going to throw what on the 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.970
 recent sentence the chopped paprika and 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:22.430
 the perfect paprika we are going to throw 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.240
 also what is the thyme all inside 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.260
 we also miss him 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.260
 the cumin the hedgehogs 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.209
 the laurel leaves that were 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 we also express ham bone 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.989
 everything inside there well tucked a 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.450
 little pinch of being but only one 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.340
 pinch because of the bone itself 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.750
 ham is salty and we do not want us 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.769
 Excessive are given 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.599
 our theme to all this the head 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.220
 of garlic, just as I have removed what 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.470
 is the outer chair skin and we're going to 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.750
 throw in and now what we're going to 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.700
 to do is to water our 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.400
 lentils until they cover a couple of 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.379
 fingers over once we have 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.359
 stopped the water our pan we have 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.220
 put to heat on high heat and 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.439
 let's take a good spray of oil 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.359
 olive and now will be here 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.180
 warming up until we see that it starts 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.859
 to boil once the lentil because 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.320
 started to sleep what we have done is 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.330
 lower the heat to medium heat and what 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.540
 let's do now is burst the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.700
 lentils 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.940
 the form and we'll leave cooking 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.890
 between 20 or 25 minutes 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.660
 when we see that our lentils 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.580
 they begin to release the foam what we are going 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.410
 to do is to remove is because this 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.830
 it is an excess of fat that we should 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.960
 get rid of 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.930
 when 25 minutes have passed 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.210
 we will separate the lentils from the fire one 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.730
 again our lentils what we are going to 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.840
 to do is take our chorizos the 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.080
 let's take out 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.750
 in a dish apart from this haidar form 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.730
 and we are also going to remove the bone from 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.710
 ham and as it is not edible and only 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.030
 It served to flavor lentils 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.540
 what we are going to do is throw it 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.670
 directly to the trash 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.830
 the chorizo that we have separated we are going to 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.110
 cut into slices and as I have not removed 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.990
 the skin has to be very very juicy 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.790
 inside that is how I like a 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.620
 once we cut our sausage 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.720
 set aside what is the head of 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.310
 garlic and we're going to put it on a plate 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.740
 also apart 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.409
 Now we could head garlic and go 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.899
 to go separating the teeth 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.959
 now we will take a deep dish and we will 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:34.909
 go see our lentils these dishes 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:36.499
 the truth is that they are quite large and 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.209
 with these deadlines I get for two 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:42.369
 relationships but if you see that they used 

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:42.369
 the smallest the same or tampa 3 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.810
 once boiled of another lentil 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.840
 we will throw a few slices of 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.479
 chorizo and in this way we are placing 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.639
 a few rooms and we will also take 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.729
 a few cloves of garlic from this 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.009
 way and once finished do not tell me 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.750
 that do not look good these lentils 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.780
 the truth is that it is to catch the 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.340
 spoon to swarm and not leave nor drop good 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.080
