00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I'm gonna be trying out some new biomes

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.499 
I'm gonna be trying out some new biomes
in<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.389> 1.7<00:00:04.049> snapshot<00:00:04.560> so<00:00:05.490> first<00:00:06.270> thing<00:00:06.450> I

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
in the 1.7 snapshot so first thing I

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.579 
in the 1.7 snapshot so first thing I
want<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.839> I've<00:00:07.080> heard<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.379> lot<00:00:07.410> about

want to do is I've heard a lot about
these<00:00:07.980> amplified<00:00:08.610> by<00:00:08.849> them<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.210> need<00:00:09.330> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
these amplified by them so you need to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.290 
these amplified by them so you need to
go<00:00:09.510> world<00:00:09.780> type<00:00:10.080> change<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.309> pass<00:00:11.759> large

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
go world type change that pass large

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.480 
go world type change that pass large
biomes<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.840> amplify<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.099> wondering<00:00:14.250> it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

talking<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.450> what<00:00:45.710> amplified<00:00:46.710> biomes

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
talking this is what amplified biomes

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
talking this is what amplified biomes
means<00:00:47.579> oh<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.750> goodness<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.070> just

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
means oh my goodness all it is just

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
means oh my goodness all it is just
floating<00:00:51.210> islands<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
floating islands like look that's a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.910 
floating islands like look that's a
monstrous<00:00:53.399> floating<00:00:54.090> island<00:00:54.710> it's<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
monstrous floating island it's kind of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
monstrous floating island it's kind of
like<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> took<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.699> old<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.270> alpha

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
like if you took the old like alpha

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
like if you took the old like alpha
extreme<00:00:58.739> Hills<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.309> made<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.579> even

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
extreme Hills and just made them even

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.100 
extreme Hills and just made them even
beefier<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:01.109> damn<00:01:02.750> monstrous<00:01:03.750> caves

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
beefier like damn monstrous caves

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
beefier like damn monstrous caves
everything's<00:01:04.769> super<00:01:05.309> high<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.580> we're<00:01:05.850> getting

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
everything's super high up we're getting

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.090 
everything's super high up we're getting
overlay<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.390> 200<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.260> probably

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
overlay or 200 I think probably

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.760 
overlay or 200 I think probably
somewhere<00:01:08.909> around<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.180> something's<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> 252

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
somewhere around here something's in 252

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.090 
somewhere around here something's in 252
cap<00:01:11.360> yeah<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.590> why<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> mean<00:01:13.920> by

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
cap yeah this is this is why I mean by

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
cap yeah this is this is why I mean by
it<00:01:14.159> could<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.520> potentially<00:01:15.060> sky<00:01:15.299> dimension

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it could be potentially sky dimension

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.690 
it could be potentially sky dimension
like<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.860> take<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.220> these<00:01:17.340> floating

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
like if you just take all these floating

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
like if you just take all these floating
islands<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.080> remove<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> ground

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
islands and you know remove the ground

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
islands and you know remove the ground
and<00:01:20.220> everything<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> looks<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.020> what

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and everything kind of looks like what

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
and everything kind of looks like what
the<00:01:23.369> omit<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.970> initial<00:01:24.299> designs<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the omit the initial designs and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.920 
the omit the initial designs and
concepts<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> sky<00:01:25.799> dimension<00:01:26.250> work<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
concepts for the sky dimension work and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
concepts for the sky dimension work and
it's<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.350> awesome<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> impressive<00:01:29.430> like

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it's really awesome and impressive like

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.899 
it's really awesome and impressive like

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
what's like to go through the force just

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.230 
what's like to go through the force just
go<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> good<00:01:52.200> nature<00:01:52.770> hike<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.970> have

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

go on a good nature hike so you have
like<00:01:54.479> pine<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.680> called<00:01:55.799> pulled<00:01:56.399> ill<00:01:56.610> but

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
like pine it's called pulled ill but

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
like pine it's called pulled ill but
it's<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.420> kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.720> pine<00:01:57.960> ground<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it's just kind of like pine ground so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.350 
it's just kind of like pine ground so
it's<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> pine<00:01:59.640> needles<00:01:59.909> falling<00:02:00.179> on<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it's all the pine needles falling on the

this feature when I heard about it got

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
this feature when I heard about it got
me<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.229> excited<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:05.100> milestone<00:02:05.789> boulder

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
me all excited the milestone boulder

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.910 
me all excited the milestone boulder
boulders<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.860> pretty<00:02:08.009> sweet<00:02:08.360> so

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
boulders I think that's pretty sweet so

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.620 
boulders I think that's pretty sweet so
so<00:02:10.920> far<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.310> new<00:02:11.670> biomes<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.480> looking

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
so far the new biomes are really looking

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.740 
so far the new biomes are really looking
looking<00:02:13.530> cool<00:02:13.769> let's<00:02:13.920> go<00:02:14.040> find<00:02:14.400> some<00:02:14.489> more<00:02:14.760> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
looking cool let's go find some more so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.660 
looking cool let's go find some more so
now<00:02:16.019> we're<00:02:16.200> looking<00:02:16.319> at<00:02:16.620> two<00:02:16.860> more<00:02:17.190> biomes

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
now we're looking at two more biomes

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.600 
now we're looking at two more biomes
kind<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.390> these<00:02:18.540> more<00:02:18.989> pseudo<00:02:19.319> biomes<00:02:19.739> we<00:02:20.489> have

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
kind of these more pseudo biomes we have

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.180 
kind of these more pseudo biomes we have
a<00:02:20.700> stone<00:02:21.000> beach<00:02:21.269> which<00:02:22.230> looks<00:02:22.769> like<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.040> just

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.199 
really ice and snow covered beach I'll
this<00:02:43.500> biome<00:02:43.859> is<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.130> epic<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.549> thought<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:44.970> was<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
this biome is so epic I thought it was a

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.539 
this biome is so epic I thought it was a
hoax<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.720> first<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.769> ice<00:02:47.070> spikes

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
hoax at first you have the ice spikes

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.460 
hoax at first you have the ice spikes
spiky<00:02:48.299> ice<00:02:48.420> Plains<00:02:48.720> i<00:02:48.930> think<00:02:49.109> is<00:02:49.200> what<00:02:49.320> it's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
spiky ice Plains i think is what it's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.849 
spiky ice Plains i think is what it's
called<00:02:49.530> ice<00:02:50.459> Plains<00:02:50.760> bikes<00:02:51.030> yeah<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:52.350> seems

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
called ice Plains bikes yeah this seems

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.830 
called ice Plains bikes yeah this seems
like<00:02:52.950> something<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.790> crazy<00:02:54.180> mod<00:02:54.540> that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
like something out of a crazy mod that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.110 
like something out of a crazy mod that
people<00:02:55.799> can<00:02:55.950> God<00:02:56.160> do<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.700> vanilla

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
people can God do not like vanilla

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.470 
people can God do not like vanilla
minecraft<00:02:57.329> with<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.980> cool<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.579> think<00:03:00.390> this

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
minecraft with this is cool I think this

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.880 
minecraft with this is cool I think this
is<00:03:00.540> also<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> one<00:03:01.200> place<00:03:01.350> where<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.650> find

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
is also the one place where you find

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
is also the one place where you find
packed<00:03:02.190> ice<00:03:02.400> which<00:03:02.700> can't<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.030> melted<00:03:03.450> by<00:03:03.630> like

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
packed ice which can't be melted by like

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.840 
packed ice which can't be melted by like
any<00:03:04.170> sources<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:07.280> biome<00:03:08.280> just

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
any sources so this is the biome just

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.160 
any sources so this is the biome just
keep<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> biome<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:09.630> keep<00:03:09.780> getting<00:03:10.049> better

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
keep the biome just keep getting better

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.020 
keep the biome just keep getting better
like<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:10.829> really<00:03:11.100> find<00:03:11.400> something

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
like if you can really find something

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.460 
like if you can really find something
that<00:03:12.180> blends<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.600> well<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.049> problem<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.380> I

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
that blends in well to this problem is I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.440 
that blends in well to this problem is I
think<00:03:13.530> that's<00:03:13.769> only<00:03:13.859> like<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.280> thickest<00:03:15.180> part

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
think that's only like the thickest part

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.509 
think that's only like the thickest part
of<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.889> snowy<00:03:17.269> biomes<00:03:18.269> segment<00:03:19.519> but

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
of a like snowy biomes segment but

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.460 
of a like snowy biomes segment but
that's<00:03:20.819> pretty<00:03:21.090> awesome<00:03:21.209> like<00:03:22.079> if<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> just

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
that's pretty awesome like if you just

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.789 
that's pretty awesome like if you just
look<00:03:22.620> out<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.889> see<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.190> ice<00:03:23.340> spikes<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:24.799> like

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
look out and see the ice spikes I like

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:26.930 
look out and see the ice spikes I like
to<00:03:25.889> wear<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> biomes<00:03:26.430> are<00:03:26.519> going<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:26.790> is

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
to wear the biomes are going this is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.870 
to wear the biomes are going this is
this<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.359> some<00:03:27.510> cool<00:03:27.720> stuff<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.850> when<00:03:29.850> you

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
this is some cool stuff and when you

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.729 
this is some cool stuff and when you
start<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.299> look<00:03:30.359> at<00:03:30.510> biomes<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.200> it

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
start to look at biomes like this it

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.440 
start to look at biomes like this it
feels<00:03:31.769> like<00:03:32.190> mojang<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.819> really<00:03:33.209> paying

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
feels like mojang is really paying

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.910 
feels like mojang is really paying
attention<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.319> other<00:03:34.440> mod<00:03:34.680> packs

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
attention to like the other mod packs

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.920 
attention to like the other mod packs
out<00:03:35.069> there<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.430> improve<00:03:35.670> biomes<00:03:36.120> because

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
out there that improve biomes because

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.629 
out there that improve biomes because
here's<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.170> birch<00:03:37.350> force<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.859> is<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.190> biomes

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
here's a birch force this is in biomes

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.210 
here's a birch force this is in biomes
of<00:03:38.730> Plenty<00:03:39.000> biomes<00:03:39.329> XL<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.769> really<00:03:41.069> is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
of Plenty biomes XL and it really is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.710 
of Plenty biomes XL and it really is
belong<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.639> Minecraft<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.180> quite<00:03:42.510> some<00:03:42.690> time

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
belong to Minecraft for quite some time

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.170 
belong to Minecraft for quite some time
because<00:03:43.079> birch<00:03:43.650> trees<00:03:44.010> being<00:03:44.549> plentiful<00:03:45.090> if

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
because birch trees being plentiful if

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.700 
because birch trees being plentiful if
you<00:03:45.269> really<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.630> using<00:03:45.780> birch

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
you really like using birch

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.520 
you really like using birch
nice<00:03:47.030> also<00:03:48.030> they<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.840> seemed<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.170> updated

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
nice also they have seemed to updated

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.370 
nice also they have seemed to updated
swamps<00:03:49.950> quite<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> bit<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:51.200> textures<00:03:52.200> are<00:03:52.320> a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
swamps quite a bit the textures are a

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.920 
swamps quite a bit the textures are a
lot<00:03:52.530> more<00:03:52.560> smooth<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.670> biome<00:03:54.300> feels<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.780> lot

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
lot more smooth the biome feels a lot

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.340 
lot more smooth the biome feels a lot
more<00:03:55.130> plentiful<00:03:56.130> yet<00:03:56.730> swampy<00:03:57.210> that's<00:03:57.450> about

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
more plentiful yet swampy that's about

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.790 
more plentiful yet swampy that's about
that's<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.830> way<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> can<00:03:59.220> come<00:03:59.370> up<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.520> it<00:03:59.760> and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
that's the way I can come up with it and

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.540 
that's the way I can come up with it and
overall<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.950> looks<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.280> they're<00:04:02.400> just

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
overall it looks like they're just

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.490 
overall it looks like they're just
trying<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.820> take<00:04:03.030> steps<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.570> improve<00:04:03.900> all<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
trying to take steps to improve all the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.740 
trying to take steps to improve all the
biomes<00:04:04.860> all<00:04:05.520> right<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.090> seems<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.420> got<00:04:06.570> lucky

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
biomes all right it seems I got lucky

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.060 
biomes all right it seems I got lucky
over<00:04:07.080> here<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.590> gonna<00:04:07.740> make<00:04:07.920> my<00:04:08.040> job

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
over here this is gonna make my job

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.880 
over here this is gonna make my job
easier<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.570> have<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> roof<00:04:10.020> force<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.710> is

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
easier so we have a roof force this is

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.500 
easier so we have a roof force this is
also<00:04:11.040> being<00:04:11.280> known<00:04:11.460> as<00:04:11.490> like<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.790> dense

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
also being known as like the dense

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.070 
also being known as like the dense
mushroom<00:04:12.930> forest<00:04:13.320> because<00:04:14.390> kind<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.510> has<00:04:15.690> a

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
mushroom forest because kind of has a

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.580 
mushroom forest because kind of has a
lot<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:17.450> mushroom<00:04:18.450> biome<00:04:18.630> feel<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.560> it

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
lot of like mushroom biome feel to it

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.190 
lot of like mushroom biome feel to it
it's<00:04:20.280> really<00:04:20.430> overgrown<00:04:20.790> really<00:04:21.720> thick<00:04:21.989> and

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
it's really overgrown really thick and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.830 
it's really overgrown really thick and
then<00:04:22.350> also<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:23.340> one<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.120> now<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.300> second

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
then also it's one it's now the second

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.510 
then also it's one it's now the second
biome<00:04:25.080> which<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.350> can<00:04:25.500> find<00:04:25.530> giant<00:04:26.190> mushrooms

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
biome which you can find giant mushrooms

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.850 
biome which you can find giant mushrooms
and<00:04:26.760> there's<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.420> red<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.990> brown<00:04:28.440> giant

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and there's the red and brown giant

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.710 
and there's the red and brown giant
mushrooms<00:04:29.220> see<00:04:30.060> there's<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.600> red

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
mushrooms see there's one of the red

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.080 
mushrooms see there's one of the red
ones<00:04:30.900> over<00:04:31.110> there<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.640> this<00:04:32.640> looks<00:04:32.940> like<00:04:33.030> a

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
ones over there and this looks like a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.650 
ones over there and this looks like a
pretty<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:34.610> whimsical<00:04:35.610> biome<00:04:36.210> I'd<00:04:36.390> say

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
pretty like whimsical biome I'd say

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.180 
pretty like whimsical biome I'd say
feels<00:04:37.290> like<00:04:37.410> it's<00:04:37.530> running<00:04:37.680> through<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:38.070> have

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
feels like it's running through to have

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.710 
feels like it's running through to have
a<00:04:38.220> good<00:04:38.430> force<00:04:38.700> do<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:38.880> feel<00:04:39.090> but<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.390> could<00:04:39.600> be

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
a good force do you feel but it could be

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.870 
a good force do you feel but it could be
tedious<00:04:40.050> if<00:04:40.380> it's<00:04:40.560> really<00:04:40.830> really<00:04:41.460> dense<00:04:41.610> in

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
tedious if it's really really dense in

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.480 
tedious if it's really really dense in
some<00:04:42.060> parts<00:04:42.330> then<00:04:43.170> over<00:04:43.350> here<00:04:43.380> we<00:04:43.590> have<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
some parts then over here we have the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.530 
some parts then over here we have the
savanna<00:04:45.530> savanna<00:04:46.530> biome<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:47.120> pretty<00:04:48.120> like

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
savanna savanna biome is pretty like

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.870 
savanna savanna biome is pretty like
outback<00:04:48.780> feeling<00:04:49.440> straightforward<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.760> get

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
outback feeling straightforward you get

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.400 
outback feeling straightforward you get
some<00:04:51.030> really<00:04:51.180> nice<00:04:51.450> savannah<00:04:51.810> trees<00:04:52.110> that

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
some really nice savannah trees that

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.950 
some really nice savannah trees that
grow<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.650> all<00:04:52.980> kinds<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.430> crazy<00:04:53.790> crazy<00:04:54.600> shapes

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
grow in all kinds of crazy crazy shapes

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.530 
grow in all kinds of crazy crazy shapes
I<00:04:55.350> think<00:04:55.860> that's<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.160> different<00:04:56.850> touch<00:04:57.210> for<00:04:57.510> the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
I think that's a different touch for the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.020 
I think that's a different touch for the
tree<00:04:58.080> generation<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:59.280> have<00:04:59.400> Savannah<00:04:59.790> em

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
tree generation you have Savannah em

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.350 
tree generation you have Savannah em
which<00:05:00.300> i<00:05:00.420> guess<00:05:00.600> is<00:05:00.630> Savannah<00:05:01.020> mountains<00:05:02.360> then

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
which i guess is Savannah mountains then

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.900 
which i guess is Savannah mountains then
over<00:05:03.600> here<00:05:03.630> if<00:05:04.290> we<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:04.650> kind<00:05:05.070> of<00:05:05.160> get<00:05:05.730> all

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
over here if we can just kind of get all

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.350 
over here if we can just kind of get all
this<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.450> view<00:05:06.690> past<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.740> Savannah<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.670> also

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
this in view past the Savannah you also

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.030 
this in view past the Savannah you also
get<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.690> see<00:05:09.870> what<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.350> new<00:05:10.710> biome

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
get to see what the new biome

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.170 
get to see what the new biome
generations<00:05:11.550> like<00:05:11.700> they're<00:05:11.880> not<00:05:12.000> going<00:05:12.120> to

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
generations like they're not going to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.050 
generations like they're not going to
put<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.450> desert<00:05:12.990> next<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.800> any<00:05:14.220> kind<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.640> snowy

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
put a desert next to any kind of snowy

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.020 
put a desert next to any kind of snowy
planes<00:05:15.540> or<00:05:15.930> Tyga<00:05:16.530> anymore<00:05:16.980> everything's<00:05:17.850> just

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
planes or Tyga anymore everything's just

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.490 
planes or Tyga anymore everything's just
going<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.210> have<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.330> smooth<00:05:18.600> transition<00:05:18.990> so<00:05:19.350> say

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
going to have a smooth transition so say

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.190 
going to have a smooth transition so say
you<00:05:19.560> have<00:05:19.770> planes<00:05:20.700> into<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.390> savannah<00:05:21.780> into<00:05:22.170> a

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
you have planes into a savannah into a

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.940 
you have planes into a savannah into a
desert<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.860> think<00:05:23.640> that's<00:05:23.790> pretty<00:05:23.970> nice<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:25.200> we

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
desert I think that's pretty nice so we

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.250 
desert I think that's pretty nice so we
also<00:05:26.070> have<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.640> desert<00:05:27.120> mountains<00:05:27.480> desert<00:05:28.080> em

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
also have the desert mountains desert em

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.530 
also have the desert mountains desert em
that's<00:05:29.010> been<00:05:29.220> added<00:05:29.340> in<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.760> I<00:05:30.120> think<00:05:30.390> this<00:05:30.480> is

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
that's been added in and I think this is

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.080 
that's been added in and I think this is
a<00:05:30.690> really<00:05:30.930> neat<00:05:31.350> biome<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.950> sunflower<00:05:32.700> claims

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
a really neat biome the sunflower claims

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.420 
a really neat biome the sunflower claims
I<00:05:33.440> guess<00:05:34.440> it's<00:05:34.590> going<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:35.010> be<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.130> one<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:35.340> the

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
I guess it's going to be the one of the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.800 
I guess it's going to be the one of the
only<00:05:35.520> places<00:05:35.700> you<00:05:35.940> can<00:05:36.120> find<00:05:36.150> sunflower

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
only places you can find sunflower

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.440 
only places you can find sunflower
sunflowers<00:05:37.590> in<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.920> it's<00:05:38.610> like<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.760> nice<00:05:39.240> little

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
sunflowers in it it's like a nice little

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.990 
sunflowers in it it's like a nice little
overgrown<00:05:39.780> plains<00:05:40.470> area<00:05:40.800> has<00:05:41.310> few<00:05:41.700> extra

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
overgrown plains area has few extra

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.390 
overgrown plains area has few extra
flowers<00:05:42.330> in<00:05:42.480> there<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.840> feel<00:05:43.410> village<00:05:43.980> spawn<00:05:44.220> to

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
flowers in there I feel village spawn to

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.660 
flowers in there I feel village spawn to
be<00:05:44.550> pretty<00:05:45.090> nice<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:46.350> also<00:05:46.980> appears<00:05:47.220> that

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
be pretty nice it also appears that

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.850 
be pretty nice it also appears that
Savannah<00:05:48.090> mountains<00:05:48.450> can<00:05:48.660> go<00:05:48.780> rather<00:05:49.170> hi<00:05:49.590> this

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
Savannah mountains can go rather hi this

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.820 
Savannah mountains can go rather hi this
is<00:05:49.890> up<00:05:50.220> to<00:05:50.790> layer<00:05:50.970> 200<00:05:51.840> I'm<00:05:52.350> not<00:05:52.560> even<00:05:52.710> an

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
is up to layer 200 I'm not even an

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.370 
is up to layer 200 I'm not even an
amplified<00:05:53.370> so<00:05:53.810> looks<00:05:54.810> like<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.050> can<00:05:55.169> still

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
amplified so looks like you can still

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.490 
amplified so looks like you can still
get<00:05:55.470> some<00:05:55.650> pretty<00:05:56.190> crazy<00:05:56.520> terrain<00:05:56.910> generation

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
get some pretty crazy terrain generation

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.890 
get some pretty crazy terrain generation
at<00:05:58.500> some<00:05:58.800> points<00:05:59.190> that's<00:05:59.400> that's<00:06:00.180> just<00:06:00.450> wild

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
at some points that's that's just wild

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.670 
at some points that's that's just wild
it<00:06:01.890> also<00:06:02.130> appears<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:03.230> villages<00:06:04.230> can<00:06:04.440> spawn

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
it also appears that villages can spawn

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.760 
it also appears that villages can spawn
in<00:06:04.830> Savannah's<00:06:05.310> thus<00:06:05.940> adding<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.450> the<00:06:06.810> new

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
in Savannah's thus adding to the new

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.400 
in Savannah's thus adding to the new
interest<00:06:08.280> intrigue<00:06:08.820> of<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:09.060> Savannah<00:06:09.870> it<00:06:10.200> has

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
interest intrigue of the Savannah it has

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.770 
interest intrigue of the Savannah it has
like<00:06:10.650> a<00:06:10.860> lot<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.430> biomes<00:06:11.790> in<00:06:11.940> one<00:06:12.150> its<00:06:12.480> new

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
like a lot of biomes in one its new

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.630 
like a lot of biomes in one its new
terrain<00:06:13.500> generation<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.130> I<00:06:14.190> think<00:06:14.280> this<00:06:14.550> is

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
terrain generation so I think this is

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.880 
terrain generation so I think this is
going<00:06:14.790> to<00:06:14.880> be<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.030> good<00:06:15.510> step<00:06:15.810> for<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.500> way<00:06:16.650> that

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
going to be a good step for the way that

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.120 
going to be a good step for the way that
the<00:06:17.070> villages<00:06:17.580> are<00:06:17.729> going<00:06:17.970> and<00:06:18.180> just<00:06:18.210> the

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
the villages are going and just the

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.170 
the villages are going and just the
helps<00:06:20.130> up<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.340> terrain<00:06:20.550> generation<00:06:20.700> and

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
helps up the terrain generation and

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.250 
helps up the terrain generation and
overall<00:06:22.100> also<00:06:23.100> there<00:06:23.340> should<00:06:23.370> be<00:06:23.820> mesas<00:06:24.570> aka

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
overall also there should be mesas aka

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.750 
overall also there should be mesas aka
the<00:06:25.410> disco<00:06:25.770> mountains<00:06:26.130> where<00:06:26.340> there's<00:06:26.580> like

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
the disco mountains where there's like

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.800 
the disco mountains where there's like
stained<00:06:28.160> clay<00:06:29.160> everywhere<00:06:29.700> I<00:06:29.940> just<00:06:30.660> can't

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
stained clay everywhere I just can't

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.300 
stained clay everywhere I just can't
find<00:06:30.990> it<00:06:31.140> something<00:06:31.530> it's<00:06:31.680> implemented<00:06:32.160> yet

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
find it something it's implemented yet

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.150 
find it something it's implemented yet
you<00:06:32.550> know<00:06:32.729> they're<00:06:33.030> just<00:06:33.060> extremely<00:06:33.890> rare<00:06:34.890> and

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
you know they're just extremely rare and

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.219 
you know they're just extremely rare and
there's<00:06:35.640> also<00:06:35.790> flowered<00:06:36.360> hills<00:06:36.570> and<00:06:36.900> flowered

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
there's also flowered hills and flowered

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.340 
there's also flowered hills and flowered
forces<00:06:37.770> which<00:06:38.130> look<00:06:38.400> pretty<00:06:39.270> cool<00:06:39.510> I<00:06:39.780> could

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
forces which look pretty cool I could

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.800 
forces which look pretty cool I could
get<00:06:40.470> all<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:40.740> new<00:06:40.940> flower<00:06:41.940> features<00:06:42.450> land

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
get all the new flower features land

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
vividly colored flowers this is a nice

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.190 
vividly colored flowers this is a nice
place<00:06:50.040> it's<00:06:50.520> really<00:06:51.450> really<00:06:51.750> happy<00:06:51.960> and

cheery but can't shoot me up i want my
disco<00:06:54.660> biome<00:06:55.050> so<00:06:56.040> it<00:06:56.400> looks<00:06:56.580> like<00:06:56.669> that's<00:06:57.419> all

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
disco biome so it looks like that's all

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.150 
disco biome so it looks like that's all
the<00:06:57.750> biomes<00:06:58.200> implemented<00:06:58.590> right<00:06:58.770> now<00:06:58.919> there's

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
the biomes implemented right now there's

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.280 
the biomes implemented right now there's
also<00:06:59.310> cliffs<00:06:59.700> and<00:07:00.090> extreme<00:07:00.450> Hills<00:07:00.690> plus

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
also cliffs and extreme Hills plus

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.140 
also cliffs and extreme Hills plus
stream<00:07:02.250> house<00:07:02.400> plots<00:07:02.669> are<00:07:02.820> pretty<00:07:03.030> much

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
stream house plots are pretty much

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.030 
stream house plots are pretty much
extreme<00:07:03.570> Hills<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.960> way<00:07:04.080> they<00:07:04.229> are<00:07:04.260> in<00:07:04.440> 1.6

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
extreme Hills the way they are in 1.6

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.100 
extreme Hills the way they are in 1.6
now<00:07:05.250> because<00:07:05.669> they're<00:07:06.540> trying<00:07:06.780> to<00:07:06.810> tell<00:07:07.020> them

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
now because they're trying to tell them

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.780 
now because they're trying to tell them
back<00:07:07.260> everything<00:07:07.680> to<00:07:07.860> make<00:07:08.190> room<00:07:08.400> for<00:07:08.640> the<00:07:08.760> new

biome features and other than that

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.420 
biome features and other than that
there's<00:07:12.810> cliffs<00:07:13.229> those<00:07:13.890> are<00:07:14.100> pretty<00:07:14.220> much
