00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
but high fire rate kind of makes up for

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.119 
but high fire rate kind of makes up for
it<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.219> it's<00:00:41.219> iron<00:00:41.520> sights<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.149> off

but<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:27.980> one<00:02:28.100> matter

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.850 

uh<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:34.230> when<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> know<00:02:35.379> people<00:02:35.590> learn<00:02:35.829> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
uh just when you know people learn a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.380 
uh just when you know people learn a
certain<00:02:36.040> place<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.310> just<00:02:36.519> gotta<00:02:36.849> remember

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
certain place you just gotta remember

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.740 
certain place you just gotta remember
and<00:02:37.750> deal<00:02:38.379> with<00:02:38.560> them<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.849> shouldn't<00:02:40.090> walk

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
and deal with them like I shouldn't walk

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.600 
and deal with them like I shouldn't walk
out<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.049> front<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.319> sniper<00:02:41.860> when<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.459> knew

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
out in front of the sniper when I knew

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.009 
out in front of the sniper when I knew
he's<00:02:42.790> there<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.299> through<00:02:43.569> Nate<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.840> there

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
he's there but through Nate in there

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.319 
he's there but through Nate in there
which<00:02:44.370> unfortunately<00:02:45.370> didn't<00:02:45.819> kill<00:02:45.939> him<00:02:46.060> then

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
which unfortunately didn't kill him then

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.850 
which unfortunately didn't kill him then
I<00:02:46.390> ran<00:02:46.569> in<00:02:46.689> and<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.870> course<00:02:47.170> he<00:02:47.290> has<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.409> shotgun

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
I ran in and of course he has a shotgun

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.250 
I ran in and of course he has a shotgun
secondary<00:02:48.370> which<00:02:48.760> kills<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.390> really<00:02:50.079> don't

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
secondary which kills me I really don't

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.509 
secondary which kills me I really don't
think<00:02:50.319> shotgun<00:02:50.739> should<00:02:50.860> be<00:02:50.950> secondary<00:02:51.280> it's

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
think shotgun should be secondary it's

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.710 
think shotgun should be secondary it's
really<00:02:51.700> annoying<00:02:51.909> when<00:02:51.940> snipers<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.569> them

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
really annoying when snipers have them

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.869 
really annoying when snipers have them
and<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.319> switched<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.739> them<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.370> bull

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
and is switched to them and this bull

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.039 
and is switched to them and this bull
your<00:02:55.030> head<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.209> when<00:02:55.329> he<00:02:55.420> can't<00:02:55.599> try<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.840> sneak

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
your head up when he can't try to sneak

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.009 
your head up when he can't try to sneak
up<00:02:56.170> from<00:02:56.200> behind<00:02:56.349> them<00:02:56.940> which<00:02:57.940> they<00:02:58.510> should

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
up from behind them which they should

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.509 
up from behind them which they should
just<00:02:59.049> have<00:02:59.230> like<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.379> pistol<00:02:59.799> or<00:02:59.890> something<00:03:00.250> so

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
just have like a pistol or something so

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.530 
just have like a pistol or something so
it<00:03:00.609> wouldn't<00:03:00.819> be<00:03:00.909> as<00:03:01.000> unfair<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:07.390> they're

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
it wouldn't be as unfair but they're

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.930 
it wouldn't be as unfair but they're

little bit you can't really see so I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.000 
little bit you can't really see so I
gotta<00:05:30.860> burst<00:05:31.250> fire<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.730> for<00:05:32.000> longer<00:05:32.720> ranges<00:05:33.200> no
