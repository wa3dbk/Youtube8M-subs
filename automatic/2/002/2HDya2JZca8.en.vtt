00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.320
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.320
 is to search in your android store 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.010
 various programs or applications with 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.800
 those that came more 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.370
 can see the second 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.560
 is redirected is an age that's why the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:08.270
 very very good price 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:14.400

 can carry out from the pc and those 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.810

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.170

 you can see 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.600
 that the fancy is loaded the cloth in a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.120
 application and it will not leave the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.960
 application and from here we can perform 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.700
 the offers 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:01.480

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.640
 directly from the browser 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.100
 diego directly from the app 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.620
 speak to us when navigating with those of many 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.549
 of other applications ptc android 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.489
 they have the main pts and the other 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.170
 they only meet and the others only 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:53.760
 find from 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.340
 of the computers good practice 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.459
 I have is 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.709
 how can you see that the ad has already loaded 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.489
 and won 0 0 1 and the operator behind or 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.489
 Buddhism 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.080
 a set 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:23.270
 yes 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:26.139
 if the sfa can give back the saw 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.760
 just the one on the shore 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.639
 a request arrives 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.090
 if they write something of that 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.540
 but they stay 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.250
 and they can be seen 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.250
 who already reloads them 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.100
 the user is saved without filters you want 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.400
 the user is back 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.240
 but not always 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.240
 not always 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.710
 to save six times will be unlocked and 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.710
 they are going to have to wrap up the home 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.139
 as you can see again we are in 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.530
 abuse 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:25.289
 for those who are new users in the 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:30.689
 box can register 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:33.150
 and if you want, you can refer to that route 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:37.010
 from ponce 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.010
 and thus be able to give 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:45.710
 make me be your transferred 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.710
 and can only help with this 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.620
 the very simple registration have to be 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.220
 of legal age 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.370
 and well let's talk about other staff the 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.560
 athens the click sense I can not 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.560
 use because the clicks themselves do not 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.420
 you can not drive through a 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.420
 and 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:24.370
 my clicks where they can handle 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.370
 through webs and web networks but so 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.380
 forget about the offers to share and 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.220
 ways to win 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.220
 with that 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:42.090
 giving us a little bit of ads but I 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.560
 stress in such Russian pressures and 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.090
 You can see that I have 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.090
 in short it is repeated 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.240
 yes yes 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.790
 click asia 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.300
 clicks and clicks and clicks and they 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.300
 click demo 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:19.540
 and you can see that loaded perfectly 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.540
 it would be 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.520
 click sense 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.490
 and judgment books 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.639
 no no 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.500
 good internet is a bit slow 

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.500
 but a see that follows 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.220
 and yes 

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.570
 when he answered me it was top five 

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.900
 I hope you liked it and there 's the 

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.900
 portion
