00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.450
 Hey, guys, this video or teaching you guys. 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.550
 athlete is a virus that causes you to always enlighten 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.619
 the error is here 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.549
 use the platform 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.240
 and when you read that it does not send or send reports, it did 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.659
 automatically msn 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.659
 tamu I can be caused by this kings 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.589
 can cause them this 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.189
 and that if you have to make or uninstall the skis, usually your msn 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.259
 or a model in compatibility mode 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.259
 so to do this you have to sell the computer 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 lime disk 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 program files 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.270
 live windows 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 contacts 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 deal with it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.460
 with the extra point 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.140
 troops your file there you will do what is important and bed it 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.080
 compatibility properties 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 first that it has been said deactivation systems 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.870
 then you run compatibility slime with windows 2000 no 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.870
 it worked out 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.270
 if I tried there and did not get it, put another 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.350
 did not work and the 98 did not work and the 95 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.630
 if none of the works and the mind dared you are with the virus 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.120
 or you have to say there are skis you put your party 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.580
 Many people say that they delete this file here 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.300
 This is important to remember. 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.760
 ms missing works it really works 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.320
 but he 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.770
 as impossible 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.370
 the selected 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.520
 or send invitations that people add on msn 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.840
 so that's a crack the problem partially 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 I do not recommend 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.070
 second goal you can be with the virus so let's start 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.840

 you type msconfig 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.449
