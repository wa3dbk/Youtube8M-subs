 totally free to do this 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.270
 you need a pc because you have to 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.760
 download a file from the internet that 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.759
 I'll leave the description down there 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.510
 Well, we begin when you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.519
 download the file just discuss it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.519
 It's in Chinese but in the problem 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.829
 they say that if when normal they put 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:56.020
 next accept next following 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.520
 next and next install

 is going to install alone 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.970
 when they put it when they put when 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 download all just put it not 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.940
 they can accept and since they do not have the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.630
 file the program the application and it 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.630
 they go to the application 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.520
 and they will see what they say if they go to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.830
 see that there are different applications that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 are in the appstore, of course, not 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.400
 there are all no no they are not found 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.070
 all that is in the lapse but 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.110
 yes there are some very good 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.440
 for example to see 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.090
 let's go to our ipad ipod or iphone is 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.340
 this works in any version 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:46.880
 on any ipod phone that you have not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.609
 there is problem for example let's see for 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.130
 example here we have this application that 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.130
 it's called let's find another one 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.350
 let's see for example 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.409
 mother bed three that are 89 pesos 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.060
 we go to our application here 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.810
 we wrote 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.810
 modern 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.670
 combat 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.180
 3 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.300
 and here is only what you have to be 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.910
 install and ready here is installed 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.569
 but as it weighs a lot it's going to last a lot 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.249
 let's download another application 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.249
 to see one that weighs us so much 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.110
 oscar is google in accounts here here 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.670
 will be 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.670
 the next thing you have to do 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.069
 is to connect your 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.120
 connect your usb cable to the ipad so 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.120
 what do you have 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.160
 connect and then you have to comment 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.160
 one piece 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.079
 [Applause] 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.350
 and if you see here the name should appear 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:32.770
 from your ipad and when you arrive they have here 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.590
 we are going to erase it because 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.030
 and right now I'll pause will 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.490
 put a pause for what 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.770
 because when it's already downloaded 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.569
 application see the next step that 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.530
 They have to do 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.350
 although right now I'm back 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.440
 ok friends since you are downloading 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.440
 the application 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.909
 have to 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.099
 89 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.180
 have to spend here here on the ipad 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.180

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.970

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.470

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.540
