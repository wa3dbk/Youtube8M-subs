Louboutin<00:00:32.700> heels<00:00:32.910> now<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:35.130> dress<00:00:35.370> up

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920 
Louboutin heels now I think to dress up
a<00:00:35.640> look<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.540> important

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
a look like this I think it's important

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.430 
a look like this I think it's important
to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.800> heel<00:00:38.790> that's<00:00:39.030> pointy<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.660> pretty

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to do a heel that's pointy and pretty

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 
to do a heel that's pointy and pretty
high<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.399> makes<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.120> t-shirt<00:00:42.870> look

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
high I think that makes the t-shirt look

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.040 
high I think that makes the t-shirt look
a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.320> less<00:00:43.559> casual<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.809> doing<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
a little less casual and doing it with a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
a little less casual and doing it with a
skirt<00:00:46.320> always<00:00:46.590> helps<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.219> did<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> midi<00:00:47.940> skirt

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
skirt always helps to I did a midi skirt

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.790 
skirt always helps to I did a midi skirt
