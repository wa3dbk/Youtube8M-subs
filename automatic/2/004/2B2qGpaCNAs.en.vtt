turning into other animals you are still
casting<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> nature<00:00:55.739> themed<00:00:55.949> spells<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
casting a lot of nature themed spells a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.130 
casting a lot of nature themed spells a
lot<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> which<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.600> spells<00:00:57.899> and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
gonna be a different type of game for

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.750 
gonna be a different type of game for
people<00:06:13.960> playing<00:06:14.290> Rangers<00:06:14.740> now<00:06:14.890> you<00:06:15.520> have<00:06:15.640> to

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
people playing Rangers now you have to

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.580 
people playing Rangers now you have to
spend<00:06:15.970> your<00:06:16.060> actions<00:06:16.660> to<00:06:16.930> let<00:06:17.080> your<00:06:17.230> animal

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
spend your actions to let your animal

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.340 
spend your actions to let your animal
attack<00:06:17.920> and<00:06:18.340> so<00:06:19.090> I'm<00:06:19.270> curious<00:06:19.750> about<00:06:20.170> how

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
attack and so I'm curious about how

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.830 
attack and so I'm curious about how
they'll<00:06:20.530> play<00:06:20.710> yeah<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.580> I<00:06:21.700> think<00:06:21.760> that<00:06:22.180> like

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
they'll play yeah and I think that like

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.690 
they'll play yeah and I think that like
everything<00:06:23.110> else<00:06:23.380> was<00:06:23.560> with<00:06:23.890> this<00:06:24.070> addition<00:06:24.490> I

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
everything else was with this addition I

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.370 
everything else was with this addition I
think<00:06:25.000> they've<00:06:25.180> they've<00:06:25.540> got<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.900> tone<00:06:26.110> right

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
think they've they've got the tone right

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.830 
think they've they've got the tone right
and<00:06:26.710> they're<00:06:27.520> they're<00:06:27.850> on<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.150> right<00:06:28.300> track

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
and they're they're on the right track

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.770 
and they're they're on the right track
and<00:06:28.930> so<00:06:29.200> my<00:06:29.380> reservations<00:06:30.130> are<00:06:30.550> more<00:06:30.940> me

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
and so my reservations are more me

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.300 
and so my reservations are more me
saying<00:06:32.110> like<00:06:32.320> well<00:06:32.500> I<00:06:32.560> don't<00:06:32.650> know<00:06:32.890> about<00:06:33.040> this

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
saying like well I don't know about this

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.910 
saying like well I don't know about this
yet<00:06:33.580> but<00:06:34.120> I'm<00:06:34.240> curious<00:06:34.720> about<00:06:34.960> what<00:06:35.350> it<00:06:35.470> is<00:06:35.500> I'm

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
yet but I'm curious about what it is I'm

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.380 
yet but I'm curious about what it is I'm
optimistic<00:06:36.340> about<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.910> so<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.120> think<00:06:37.180> that

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
optimistic about it so I think that

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.970 
optimistic about it so I think that
hopefully<00:06:37.870> when<00:06:38.140> we<00:06:38.230> see<00:06:38.380> some<00:06:38.560> Rangers<00:06:38.890> in

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
hopefully when we see some Rangers in

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.710 
hopefully when we see some Rangers in
action<00:06:39.280> at<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.430> game<00:06:39.580> table<00:06:39.940> that<00:06:40.450> they'll<00:06:40.600> be

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720
