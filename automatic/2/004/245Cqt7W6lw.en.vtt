then

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.510 

but<00:04:21.600> we<00:04:21.720> had<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.079> make<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> shot<00:04:22.889> happen<00:04:23.340> right

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
then or it wasn't gonna happen and I

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.600
