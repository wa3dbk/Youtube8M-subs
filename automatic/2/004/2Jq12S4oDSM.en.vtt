what's<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.360> pickups<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.380> know<00:00:19.800> pickups

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
what's up with pickups I know pickups

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.310 
what's up with pickups I know pickups
it's<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.940> amazing<00:00:21.210> technology<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:22.260> does

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it's like an amazing technology how does

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.080 
it's like an amazing technology how does
that<00:00:22.590> work<00:00:22.770> through<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.280> wire<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.820> get<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that work through the wire you get the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.109 
that work through the wire you get the
sound<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:25.230> crazy<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.550> gonna<00:00:26.700> explain

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
sound it's crazy right I'm gonna explain

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.130 
sound it's crazy right I'm gonna explain
it<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.450> you<00:00:27.570> okay

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it to you okay

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.130 
it to you okay
a<00:00:28.170> guy<00:00:29.160> named<00:00:29.400> Larry<00:00:29.700> Fishman<00:00:30.360> had<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.170> idea

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
a guy named Larry Fishman had an idea

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140 
a guy named Larry Fishman had an idea
this<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.379> a<00:00:34.410> long<00:00:34.650> time<00:00:34.920> ago<00:00:35.160> maybe<00:00:35.460> almost<00:00:35.850> 30

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
this was a long time ago maybe almost 30

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.110 
this was a long time ago maybe almost 30
years<00:00:36.270> ago<00:00:36.570> he<00:00:37.080> put<00:00:37.699> some<00:00:39.290> pxo<00:00:40.290> crystals<00:00:41.120> six

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
years ago he put some pxo crystals six

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.110 
years ago he put some pxo crystals six
of<00:00:42.330> them<00:00:42.449> one<00:00:42.720> unto<00:00:42.989> each<00:00:43.260> string<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.120> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
of them one unto each string and the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.260 
of them one unto each string and the
Petzl<00:00:45.660> crystal<00:00:46.080> did<00:00:46.290> something<00:00:46.680> amazing

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
Petzl crystal did something amazing

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
Petzl crystal did something amazing
piezo<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.510> greek<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.019> italian<00:00:49.110> means

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
piezo in greek and italian means

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
piezo in greek and italian means
pressure<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.909> when<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.150> played<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> string

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
pressure so when you played the string

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
pressure so when you played the string
it<00:00:52.350> hit<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> piezo<00:00:53.190> crystal<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.300> made<00:00:54.540> an

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it hit the piezo crystal and made an

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
it hit the piezo crystal and made an
electric<00:00:55.170> charge<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> electric<00:00:56.280> charge

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
electric charge and that electric charge

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.759 
electric charge and that electric charge
went<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:56.970> through<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> end<00:00:57.510> pin<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.440> an<00:00:58.559> amp

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
went out through the end pin into an amp

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.579 
went out through the end pin into an amp
and<00:00:58.979> bang<00:00:59.430> your<00:01:00.420> acoustic<00:01:00.839> guitar<00:01:01.409> was

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
and bang your acoustic guitar was

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.520 
and bang your acoustic guitar was
suddenly<00:01:01.949> an<00:01:02.790> electric<00:01:03.360> guitar<00:01:03.479> there<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.409> an

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
suddenly an electric guitar there was an

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.420 
suddenly an electric guitar there was an
electric<00:01:05.040> acoustic<00:01:05.960> pretty<00:01:06.960> cool<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.710> but

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
electric acoustic pretty cool right but

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
electric acoustic pretty cool right but
there<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.820> some<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.360> things<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
there was some little things to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.640 
there was some little things to
understand<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.430> example<00:01:12.530> impedance<00:01:13.530> now

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
understand for example impedance now

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.620 
understand for example impedance now
don't<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:14.310> crazy<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.940> me<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.390> do

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
don't go crazy on me I'm not gonna do

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
don't go crazy on me I'm not gonna do
like<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> mathematical<00:01:16.650> formula<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> am

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
like a mathematical formula but I am

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.359 
like a mathematical formula but I am
gonna<00:01:17.760> explain<00:01:17.909> impedance<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.369> because

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
gonna explain impedance to you because

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.510 
gonna explain impedance to you because
the<00:01:20.909> signal<00:01:21.480> of<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.870> guitar<00:01:22.220> travels<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the signal of a guitar travels like

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.050 
the signal of a guitar travels like
water<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.380> imagine<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> okay

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
water so just imagine it like that okay

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.630 
water so just imagine it like that okay
now<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.170> signal<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> comes<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
now the signal that comes out of that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910 
now the signal that comes out of that
kind<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> pickup<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.660> what<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.960> call<00:01:31.230> high

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
kind of pickup is what we call high

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670 
kind of pickup is what we call high
impedance<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.300> has<00:01:33.480> a<00:01:33.510> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> restriction<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
impedance it has a lot of restriction so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.630 
impedance it has a lot of restriction so
imagine<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> garden<00:01:35.730> hose<00:01:36.290> now<00:01:37.290> most<00:01:37.920> amps<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
imagine a garden hose now most amps and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.870 
imagine a garden hose now most amps and
pas<00:01:39.150> they're<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.440> call<00:01:40.650> low<00:01:41.370> impedance

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
pas they're what we call low impedance

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.750 
pas they're what we call low impedance
so<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:42.900> want<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.230> big<00:01:43.440> water<00:01:43.800> main<00:01:43.950> no

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
so they want a big water main no

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.630 
so they want a big water main no
restrictions<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.800> imagine<00:01:46.950> trying

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
restrictions so can you imagine trying

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.970 
restrictions so can you imagine trying
to<00:01:47.820> connect<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.330> garden<00:01:48.750> hose<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.590> city

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
to connect the garden hose to a city

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.070 
to connect the garden hose to a city
water<00:01:50.280> main<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.880> weird<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.840> need

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
water main to be weird so you need

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.950 
water main to be weird so you need
something<00:01:52.410> in<00:01:52.740> between<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:54.210> why<00:01:54.540> most

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
something in between that's why most

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.270 
something in between that's why most
pickups<00:01:55.500> today<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.550> battery<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.690> battery

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
pickups today have a battery the battery

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
pickups today have a battery the battery
mounted<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.550> inside<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.150> guitar

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
mounted on the inside of the guitar

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.290 
mounted on the inside of the guitar
helps<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.560> match<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.220> impedance<00:02:02.760> between<00:02:02.940> the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
helps to match the impedance between the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.210 
helps to match the impedance between the
high<00:02:03.480> impedance<00:02:03.870> signal<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:05.040> low

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
high impedance signal and the low
