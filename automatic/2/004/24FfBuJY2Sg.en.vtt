tropics<00:00:05.430> calm<00:00:05.879> I'm<00:00:06.629> going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.899> start<00:00:07.109> out<00:00:07.230> with

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
tropics calm I'm going to start out with

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.709 
tropics calm I'm going to start out with
product<00:00:08.340> quality<00:00:08.790> because<00:00:09.090> personally<00:00:09.690> I

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
product quality because personally I

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.839 
product quality because personally I
think<00:00:09.870> that's<00:00:10.200> what's<00:00:10.800> most<00:00:11.190> important<00:00:11.700> when

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
think that's what's most important when

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.400 
think that's what's most important when
it<00:00:11.969> comes<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.300> ordering<00:00:12.630> new<00:00:12.719> tropics

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it comes to ordering new tropics

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.939 
it comes to ordering new tropics
it's<00:00:14.160> really<00:00:14.400> no<00:00:15.089> secret<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.839> all<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.800> these

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it's really no secret that all of these

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.590 
it's really no secret that all of these
new<00:00:17.250> tropical<00:00:17.490> companies<00:00:18.060> source<00:00:18.330> their

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
new tropical companies source their

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
new tropical companies source their
products<00:00:19.080> from<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.619> same<00:00:19.830> three<00:00:20.220> four

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
products from the same three four

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.330 
products from the same three four
manufacturers<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> China<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> you're

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
manufacturers in China so you're

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.830 
manufacturers in China so you're
probably<00:00:23.609> getting<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> same<00:00:24.359> thing<00:00:24.390> with

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
probably getting the same thing with

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.710 
probably getting the same thing with
most<00:00:25.080> companies<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.160> been

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
most companies but there have been

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
most companies but there have been
incidents<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:28.289> vendors<00:00:28.949> selling<00:00:29.609> bogus

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
about as good as it can get so that's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.700 
about as good as it can get so that's
not<00:00:48.750> something<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not something you're going to have to

you<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> go

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you know you're not going to want to go

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.030

with<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> cheapest<00:01:10.229> product<00:01:10.650> because

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
with the cheapest product because

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.550 
with the cheapest product because
usually<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> paid<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.810> but

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
usually get what you paid for it but

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
usually get what you paid for it but
that<00:01:13.830> being<00:01:14.070> said<00:01:14.310> there's<00:01:14.700> probably<00:01:15.119> not

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that being said there's probably not

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.149 
that being said there's probably not
really<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> good<00:01:15.960> reason<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> most

the standard shipping which kind of blew

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
the standard shipping which kind of blew
me<00:01:38.310> away<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.970> expecting<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.619> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
me away I was not expecting that that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.219 
me away I was not expecting that that
being<00:01:40.860> said<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.400> only<00:01:41.549> speak<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.180> from<00:01:43.079> my

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
being said I can only speak for from my

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.929 
being said I can only speak for from my
experience<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.009> obviously<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.549> live<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
experience and obviously I live in the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.630 
experience and obviously I live in the
US<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.560> international<00:01:46.560> shipping<00:01:47.070> times<00:01:47.399> are

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
US so international shipping times are

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.990 
US so international shipping times are
obviously<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:48.540> um<00:01:49.369> now<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> last<00:01:50.759> point

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
obviously very um now the last point

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
obviously very um now the last point
what<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:52.049> sets<00:01:52.380> peaking<00:01:52.860> tropics

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
what I think really sets peaking tropics

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580
