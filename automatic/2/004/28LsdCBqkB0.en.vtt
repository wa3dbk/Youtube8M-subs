to be airing on the WWE Network I know
there<00:00:06.450> were<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> lot<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.810> questions<00:00:07.290> not<00:00:07.529> just

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
there were a lot of questions not just

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.890

about<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> Chris<00:00:08.309> Benoit<00:00:08.670> stuff<00:00:09.030> but<00:00:09.300> would

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
about the Chris Benoit stuff but would

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.110 
about the Chris Benoit stuff but would
they<00:00:10.050> air<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> same<00:00:10.559> pay-per-view<00:00:11.280> where

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
they air the same pay-per-view where

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.499 
they air the same pay-per-view where
Owen<00:00:12.509> Hart<00:00:12.719> died<00:00:13.070> whether<00:00:14.070> edited<00:00:14.639> unedited<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Owen Hart died whether edited unedited I

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.910 
Owen Hart died whether edited unedited I
mean<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.870> figured<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.500> aired<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
mean I figured if they aired it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
mean I figured if they aired it
certainly<00:00:17.490> wasn't<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.210> unedited

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
certainly wasn't going to be unedited

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290 
certainly wasn't going to be unedited

didn't happen and just move on with the
show<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.330> hard<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.840> just

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
show you know it was so hard it was just

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
show you know it was so hard it was just
it's<00:01:13.170> depressing<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.920> watch<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it's depressing to watch it's just this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's depressing to watch it's just this
dark<00:01:15.180> cloud<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.320> hangs<00:01:16.530> over

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
dark cloud that kind of hangs over

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
dark cloud that kind of hangs over
everything<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.420> been<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> while<00:01:18.840> since

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
everything and it's been a while since

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.600 
everything and it's been a while since
I've<00:01:19.290> gone<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.799> watched<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I've gone back and watched it but I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.060 
I've gone back and watched it but I
remember<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> really

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
remember one of the one of the really

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980 
remember one of the one of the really
striking<00:01:23.580> things<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> show<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
striking things about that show and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.330 
striking things about that show and
maybe<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.560> reading<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:26.130> too

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
maybe I was just reading a little too

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.990 
maybe I was just reading a little too
much<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
much into it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 
much into it
I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:28.049> are<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> people<00:01:28.680> who<00:01:28.770> would

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I think there are the people who would

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
I think there are the people who would
agree<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.220> me<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.180> watch<00:01:30.479> when

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
agree with me on this if you watch when

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.280 
agree with me on this if you watch when
the<00:01:31.500> Undertaker<00:01:31.890> makes<00:01:32.549> his<00:01:32.759> entrance<00:01:33.290> for

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the Undertaker makes his entrance for

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
the Undertaker makes his entrance for
that<00:01:34.470> main<00:01:34.680> event<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.180> guess<00:01:36.180> Pat<00:01:36.390> Patterson

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that main event I guess Pat Patterson

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.350 
that main event I guess Pat Patterson
was<00:01:37.079> supposed<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> special<00:01:37.890> referee
