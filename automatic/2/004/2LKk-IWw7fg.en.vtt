00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.440
 start and yes we are here today 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.959
 Quicktipps and I have to really easy 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.560
 consider what you can show because so 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.970
 a bit you can do most things 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 I have already shown a lot of shows 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.779
 but I'll show you alone now 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.839
 can do and it is about that too 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 the 21 ct gained control of the plant 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:35.340
 no matter what comes to me and yes 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.800
 that's what it's about and on sunday 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
 is able to announce that it will 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.190
 new format with me take a train 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 on the channel and how it works so what 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 You will hear that in the comments on sunday 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.140
 or an extra as you have to look yes 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.220
 I do that but is a format what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.930
 Definitely very good for you 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.520
 arrives and where on it many already 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 have been waiting for professionals have asked 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.560
 But catch alone control stands 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.060
 this is always very sporty for many people 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.410
 dependent and I also find good with the 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.570
 pot of works I will know from 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 a pot has been then I show that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 Now, for example , I have now 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.400
 to get the best sport for 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 you see and theoretically I would have 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.070
 Let's see if I come here 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.230
 of course, the theoretical ones 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.370
 Traces because I have to go back four 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.630
 I walk around in the approx 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.900
 position where i always start of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.250
 friendly and with topps of work 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 is good there you can make a thing 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.010
 save and namely flashes and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.060
 throw smogs on long in advance 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.990
 I'll show you that there you can me 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.150
 just start running with knives and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.350
 nice pretty tight all through the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.740
 Eckkneipe the shooter saves time and money 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.290
 can really stop directly with private 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.320
 e crime spray and if no one could 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.909
 and recover by the alone control 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 Of course, this does not work separately because 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 you can no longer stand the rank of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.830
 popstars was long did it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.460
 sometimes the hunters should be around anyway 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.960
 b and such 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.280
 and that 's what it's about when you do not 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.620
 Transport has what you do is shows 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 you, that you're running now 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.530
 that tricky has to listen carefully yes 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.299
 silently with knives best I again 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.900
 weapon like me then pulls a flash here 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.130
 runs backwards resp 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.500
 The best way to start running a knife 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 here around the corner with back pulls now 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 your small flash and if so at this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.610
 since here at this bar looks since 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 her up easy as I said 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 pulled with the flash turns 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.569
 Annoying presses when and run backwards 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.569
 is left completely for a moment 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.459
 You see, this is a really nasty pop lady 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.780
 Here comes an area where arises 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.769
 were high let go I'll tell you that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.630
 like to do it from the beginning 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:38.750
 you run knife knife knife flash 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.610
 let go run backwards before 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.650
 keep moving letter an okay 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.150
 as also time for the opponents of 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.400
 see you nice boss marius 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.930
 tilted Kloppers unequal customer chef 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.459
 werespot perry kate perry you 're like that 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.030
 cool as peter china go no 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.220
 player from when the tsg undermined yet 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.510
 let's go okay then I will show you as I do 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.400
 this is downplaying both personally 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.380
 running flesch says in the hand 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.060
 take backward run 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.739
 move stop if there is one, 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.880
 gets the most, although the full flat 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.600
 most people can not 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.150
 react 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.430
 and yes, if there is no one then flat 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.019
 as I said yes pointing backwards 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.019
 quite a bottle to go 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.340
 free fire very no smog smoke away and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.170
 then i start to position myself 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.130
 am just once a fitness dancing 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.290
 Classically I sneak on then on 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.079
 The nik me because here until he too 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.489
 a very popular positive sometimes 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.900
 then I'm just too 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.600
 really this quite normal instead of spots 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.069
 I put it behind the door or because 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.920
 I also like to do very much 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:54.230
 so here stand so because honestly who 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.500
 expect it instead of idrive then see 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.500
 her that 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.510
 is already in there so always sees this 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.550
 later then for that contains there then so 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.560
 if you go out as a team, you are 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.270
 Consider smogs tactics 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.030
 flash the general hints what 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.160
 think carefully then always where are 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.320
 because the prims sportswear of the opponents 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.120
 after all, where is the back and that is 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.070
 A typical case long is more like that 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.230
 you yes peeps whether as a victory 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.200
 explain ok and then it's pid 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.460
 opponent and there he now has the position 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.930
 has been sitting and reigning for a long time 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.900
 only on yours when he sees you 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.220
 your two headphones 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.240
 that's very important so if we have 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.880
 here then is somehow just always 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.450
 everything so off or some 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.170
 do so here is also very much like 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.910
 no one around then then no then see 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.370
 so tih rum 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.570
 So postage and simply shoots us 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.750
 nobody in the mbc is on the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.440
 headphones and that's just like me alone 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.420
 try to have control 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.080
 to have control I top sports no 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.340
 have and yes or I know that the thesis 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.780
 transport work because there they are 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.730
 usually a little earlier than that 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.900
 even if the topsponsor therefore always 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.250
 always go behind 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.910
 I'll show it again and again 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.990
 take it better again 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.350
 Wester take it next to the knives 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.000
 run backwards flash related 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.050
 let go 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.300
 move fri celebrate tomorrow and then 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.450
 then cancel 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.550
 where want your thing then, then, 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.900
 Door there is totally no matter 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.490
 but then you have your control 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.840
 facilities you can access again alone 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.640
 he can play second immediately masterful 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.120
 he comes to the Support at all if 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.410
 namely draufspielt can me 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.850
 Looking again shortly sees nothing and 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.450
 can then be labeled with a short time later 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.070
 help out 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.070
 and I would say that from me 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.770
 is 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.690
 beckett 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.760
