00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.780 
I would like to see what they look like
I<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.270> about<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.500> far<00:01:59.250> apart

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I would think about that far apart

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.270 
I would think about that far apart
so<00:02:00.600> let's<00:02:00.810> put<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.920> wind<00:02:02.100> them

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so let's put one you just wind them

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
so let's put one you just wind them
again<00:02:02.579> should<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> put<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.060> soil<00:02:03.329> set<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
again should I put this soil set on the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.590 
again should I put this soil set on the
top<00:02:04.200> we

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
top we

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.110 
top we
some<00:02:04.870> place<00:02:05.050> for<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.470> roots<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.280> grow<00:02:06.370> so<00:02:06.640> I'd

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
some place for the roots to grow so I'd

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.630 
some place for the roots to grow so I'd
like<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.420> start<00:02:07.810> at<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.020> center<00:02:08.410> okay<00:02:09.369> so

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
like to start at the center okay so

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.600 
like to start at the center okay so
we've<00:02:09.789> got<00:02:09.820> one<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> center<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.610> then

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
we've got one in the center and then

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.080 
we've got one in the center and then
just<00:02:12.970> put<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.810> others<00:02:14.260> around<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.670> same

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
just put the others around with the same

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.220 
just put the others around with the same
distance<00:02:16.600> all<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.080> way<00:02:17.410> around<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.990> looks

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
distance all the way around it looks

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.900 
distance all the way around it looks
great<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.290> he<00:02:23.530> smells<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:24.550> little<00:02:24.790> bit

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
great and I think he smells a little bit

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:35.449 
great and I think he smells a little bit
dark<00:02:25.240> color<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.720> balls<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.410> mean<00:02:26.560> how<00:02:26.740> could<00:02:26.890> you

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.360 

some<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> most<00:02:36.760> thing<00:02:37.270> does<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.540> matter

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
some of the most thing does that matter

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.780 
some of the most thing does that matter
well<00:02:39.370> what<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.760> want<00:02:39.970> they're<00:02:40.390> not<00:02:40.660> quite

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
well what we want they're not quite

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.180 
well what we want they're not quite
sprouting<00:02:42.790> almost<00:02:43.540> okay<00:02:43.989> it's<00:02:44.530> actually<00:02:44.860> and
