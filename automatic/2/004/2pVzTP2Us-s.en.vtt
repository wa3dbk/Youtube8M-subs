 Haku: Neru, are you going somewhere? 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Neru: Em ... It's like ... 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600
 Luka: I know. He's going on a date. 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.699
 Meiko: With Len * fliu * 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Neru: Ugh ... And what's wrong with that? 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 Haku: Nothing wrong with that. Good luck! 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.699
 Luka: Let it go as best as you can! 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 Meiko: Apply your famous technique! 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.000
 Neru: What technique? I do not have any! 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Neru: I'm sick! I'm going out! 

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.500
 Haku: Have a nice day. 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.799
 Meiko: ...... Hey, let's follow them. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Luka: Okay. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.500
 Haku: What? But... 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 Meiko: We have nothing better to do anyway, right? 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 Meiko: We're going. Fast! 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.000
 Meiko: Oh, they're doing something. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 Luka: They look happy. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 Meiko: What are they talking about? 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.500
 Len: It's really hot today. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.700
 Neru: Tja, even too warm. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200
 Len: I can buy ice cream. Do you want some? 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.799
 Neru: You do not need ... 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.399
 Len: Come on. I'll be back. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 Neru: OK. 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.300
 Meiko: They annoy me. 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.500
 Meiko: Haku, can you give my advice to Ner? 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 Haku: It's clear. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 Neru:!? 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.299
 Neru: (What? What are they doing !?) 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Neru: (Huh, look at him and knock him over.) 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
 Neru: (I can not do something so embarrassing.) 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.299
 Len: Hey, I came back with ice cream. 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.000
 Neru: Oh! Thank you! 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Neru: Kya! 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.299
 Meiko: Wow! She really did! 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.000
 Luka: Okay, there's nothing. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.300
 Meiko: Trying to escape! But nothing of it will fail her! 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 Meiko: Let's give them away! 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.300
 Meiko: We lost them. Let's stop and look around. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.000
 Haku: Maybe let's finish it? 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.599
 Haku: Huh? Wait for me! 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.800
 Neru: (They should not chase me anymore ...) 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.500
 Meiko: Well, it's good. But she should not underestimate adults. 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:14.399
 Luka: Okay, but she chose a rather dangerous place. 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.699
 Luka: I'll talk to her later. 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.500
 Meiko: Do ​​not do it! If you tell her, she'll know we've followed her. 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 Meiko: Well, what is the fun like no risk? 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Luka: That what? 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Meiko: Romance is like a roller coaster. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
 Meiko: It gives a kick of adrenaline! 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.000
 Meiko: The more dangerously the better! 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.500
 Luka: I do not understand. 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 Luka: I mean, it's dangerous to go out on an unprotected roof. 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 Luka: This is not about romance ... 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 Haku: Hm? What is? 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500
 Meiko: What's going on !? 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.900
 Haku: They will kiss. 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.000
 Meiko: Really !? Give it! 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Haku: I will not give you! 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Meiko: Why are you so stubborn in such moments !? Come on! But this is already ...! 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Luka: Hey, you two, calm down! 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Huh !? 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.899
 Meiko: I HAVE YOU FINALLY !! 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.300
 Oops. 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.800
 Len: Ner? 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
