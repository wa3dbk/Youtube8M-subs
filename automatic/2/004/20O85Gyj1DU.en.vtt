thing I noticed when this big bad boy

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
thing I noticed when this big bad boy
arrived<00:00:47.040> was<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> was<00:00:47.550> indeed<00:00:47.850> much

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
arrived was that it was indeed much

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
arrived was that it was indeed much
larger<00:00:48.870> than<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.110> had<00:00:49.199> imagined<00:00:49.739> 84<00:00:50.130> inches<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
larger than I had imagined 84 inches to
actually<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.480> don't<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.140> why<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.590> for

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.020 
actually be I don't know why but for
some<00:00:52.739> reason<00:00:53.070> 84<00:00:53.430> inches<00:00:53.579> didn't<00:00:53.880> seem<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
some reason 84 inches didn't seem that

since we started the shoot quite early
in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> day<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> Sun<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.850> still<00:01:18.060> relatively

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in the day the Sun was still relatively

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
in the day the Sun was still relatively
high<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:18.990> sky<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.190> perfect

situation<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.060> basically<00:01:21.390> test<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.930> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
situation to basically test out it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.649 
situation to basically test out it's
screaming<00:01:22.590> goodness<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.060> compositional

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
screaming goodness and for compositional

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.000 
screaming goodness and for compositional
reasons<00:01:24.960> basically<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.470> did<00:01:25.560> starting

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
reasons basically what we did starting

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.320 
reasons basically what we did starting
out<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.369> were<00:01:26.460> shooting<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> direction

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
out is we were shooting in the direction

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
out is we were shooting in the direction
of<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.900> Sun<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> Sun<00:01:29.070> but

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
of the Sun or not with the Sun but

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.310 
of the Sun or not with the Sun but
against<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.670> Sun<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.020> someone<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.200> we

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
against the Sun and someone because we

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.810 
against the Sun and someone because we
had<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> better<00:01:31.770> background<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
had a better background in that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
had a better background in that
direction<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:34.020> several<00:01:34.380> shots<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
direction so for several shots we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380 
direction so for several shots we
actually<00:01:35.189> started<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.700> using<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> Sun

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
actually started out using the Sun

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
actually started out using the Sun
Buster<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> block<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.439> direct<00:01:37.560> sunlight<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
Buster to block the direct sunlight so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
Buster to block the direct sunlight so
we<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.610> get<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> much<00:01:39.090> softer<00:01:39.840> natural<00:01:40.259> hair

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we can get a much softer natural hair

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
we can get a much softer natural hair
light<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.490> basically<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
light and you can basically see the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
difference in the hair light with and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
difference in the hair light with and
without<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> umbrella<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.000> shots

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
without the umbrella as in these shots

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.690 
without the umbrella as in these shots
of<00:01:46.049> course<00:01:46.320> artistically<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> brighter<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
of course artistically the brighter and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
of course artistically the brighter and
more<00:01:47.880> blown<00:01:48.150> out<00:01:48.270> hair<00:01:48.540> also<00:01:48.930> works

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
more blown out hair also works

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.450 
more blown out hair also works
completely<00:01:49.650> fine<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.220> what<00:01:50.340> you're

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
completely fine if that's what you're

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.310 
completely fine if that's what you're
going<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.119> sometimes<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:51.990> nice<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
going for but sometimes it's nice to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
going for but sometimes it's nice to
shoot<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.189> subtle<00:01:53.520> hair<00:01:53.820> lighting

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
shoot with the more subtle hair lighting

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.490 
shoot with the more subtle hair lighting
so<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> don't<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.900> lot<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> blown

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so that you don't have a lot of blown

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
frame but the thing was we ran into a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.130 
frame but the thing was we ran into a
little<00:02:08.940> snag<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.540> we<00:02:09.660> were<00:02:09.720> using<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
little snag when we were using the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.620 
little snag when we were using the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
shooting with the direction of the Sun

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.009 
shooting with the direction of the Sun
we<00:02:14.640> attempted<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.090> use<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> umbrella<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.900> we

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
we attempted to use the umbrella as we

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.949 
we attempted to use the umbrella as we
would<00:02:16.230> say<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> nice<00:02:16.890> scrim<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.239> soften<00:02:18.570> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
would say a nice scrim and to soften and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.050 
would say a nice scrim and to soften and
cut<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.769> light<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> problem

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
cut a bit of the light but the problem

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
cut a bit of the light but the problem
was<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.510> softened<00:02:22.079> just<00:02:22.320> fine<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
was that it softened just fine but it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.069 
was that it softened just fine but it
blocked<00:02:23.340> too<00:02:23.760> much<00:02:24.000> light<00:02:24.299> we're<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.019> a

to<00:02:31.410> basically<00:02:31.710> balance<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> subject<00:02:32.670> would

to basically balance the subject would

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.670 
to basically balance the subject would
say<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> bright<00:02:33.390> blue<00:02:33.630> sky<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.320> long<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
say a bright blue sky so long as it

the<00:02:37.260> Sun<00:02:37.530> Buster<00:02:37.860> was<00:02:37.980> cutting<00:02:38.280> down<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.760> much

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the Sun Buster was cutting down so much

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.430 
the Sun Buster was cutting down so much
light<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.180> almost<00:02:39.690> looked<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:39.930> basically

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
light that almost looked like basically

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440 
light that almost looked like basically
full<00:02:40.830> shade<00:02:41.220> or<00:02:41.700> our<00:02:41.850> subject<00:02:42.210> became

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
full shade or our subject became

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.300 
full shade or our subject became
essentially<00:02:42.990> too<00:02:43.230> dark<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.680> balance<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
essentially too dark to balance with the

bit of light use now while each of these

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.850 
bit of light use now while each of these

actually good with a needle it was a bit

it comes to diffusion cover itself it's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720 
it comes to diffusion cover itself it's
still<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> very<00:03:46.650> useful<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.280> relatively

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
still a very useful and relatively
