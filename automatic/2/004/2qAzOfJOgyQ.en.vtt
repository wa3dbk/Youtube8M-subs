00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
manga instead responsibility i think

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
manga instead responsibility i think
it's<00:00:56.310> interesting<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:57.090> many<00:00:57.330> people<00:00:57.690> are

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it's interesting how many people are

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.390 
it's interesting how many people are
starting<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.290> get<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.800> upset<00:00:59.040> by<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
starting to get really upset by the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.450 
starting to get really upset by the
continued<00:00:59.850> use<00:00:59.880> of<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.360> term<00:01:00.540> MOBA<00:01:01.200> because<00:01:01.980> i

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
continued use of the term MOBA because i

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.260 
continued use of the term MOBA because i
guess<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.120> created<00:01:03.739> by<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> company<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.820> an

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
guess it was created by a company as an

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.429 
guess it was created by a company as an
overall<00:01:07.049> term<00:01:07.789> but<00:01:09.049> some<00:01:10.049> people<00:01:10.259> feel<00:01:10.409> that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
overall term but some people feel that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
overall term but some people feel that
it's<00:01:10.679> not<00:01:10.829> quite<00:01:11.189> accurate<00:01:11.399> if<00:01:12.149> you<00:01:12.359> are<00:01:12.509> one

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's not quite accurate if you are one

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's not quite accurate if you are one
