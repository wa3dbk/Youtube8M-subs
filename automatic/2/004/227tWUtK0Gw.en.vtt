00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.240
 so we arrived monday will also be a very nice plan in every 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.240
 the Roma from here to eighteen hectares 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.380
 faithful to his strategy since 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.750
 in euros it is cut standards find we are on a tip 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.869
 we look forward to islets 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.069
 we can not wait for the shoals 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.140
 the funds collected the blue defender a little basic 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 so it is very interesting and a trash card population 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.860
 we were told about several fish exceeding the bar of twenty kilos on 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.170
 hope to take 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.090
 I hope we have tried my luck 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.190
 to admire them 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 in e2 earlier this year from 16 to 9 to jump in the middle 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.640
 we put it in trust 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.560
 to spread over different positions that we have chosen 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.130
 according to the affinities with respect to 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.250
 long-distance fishing from the shore 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.840
 so here here on a tip like that so dell for what it's a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 advanced natural in the water that allows us to gain distance 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.900
 or again these 9 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 for the case of five days of fishing 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.000
 we have chosen a place where we are particularly well suited to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 fishing the long distance from the edge since the album rate is forbidden 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.750
 so we have to use the implement strategies and techniques 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 which allows me to fish law 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.369
 what did we have the maps are in very easily localizable seems in 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.689
 right in the middle of the water and it shows up very regularly 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.040
 are active 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.930
 so 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.870
 it makes sense to fishing we do not fish far to do well to 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.460
 impress friends because we feel beyond them 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.600
 his exploit because there are reasons 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 the fish sometimes take us unfairly and to extend lines 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.500
 by boat did in the distance
