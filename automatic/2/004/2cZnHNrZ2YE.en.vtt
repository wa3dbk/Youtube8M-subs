00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
acrylic start feeding after a while
anything<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.520> fade<00:01:50.730> after<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:51.090> while

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
anything will really fade after a while

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.970 
anything will really fade after a while
if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.870> into<00:01:52.020> aquarium<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.830> got

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
if you put into aquarium because you got

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.870 
if you put into aquarium because you got
them<00:01:53.190> your<00:01:54.090> overhead<00:01:54.720> lights<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.770> uh

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
them your overhead lights and just uh

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.340 
them your overhead lights and just uh
water<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.450> makes<00:01:57.690> everything<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
water and just makes everything kind of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
water and just makes everything kind of
dull<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> dingy<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.760> anyways<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
dull and dingy so anyways that's the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.490 
dull and dingy so anyways that's the
that's<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> cast<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:03.170> just<00:02:04.170> painted<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that's the cast I just painted this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.960 
that's the cast I just painted this
probably<00:02:04.800> about<00:02:04.980> half<00:02:05.430> an<00:02:05.550> hour<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.760> an<00:02:05.909> hour

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
probably about half an hour to an hour

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.950 
probably about half an hour to an hour
ago

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ago

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.040 
ago
so<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.220> uh<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.810> let<00:02:09.959> me<00:02:09.990> show

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so that's uh that's that now let me show

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.010 
so that's uh that's that now let me show
you<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.350> resins<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.830> used<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.520> well

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
you the resins I used for this as well

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.490 
you the resins I used for this as well
and<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:14.270> use<00:02:15.270> tap<00:02:15.750> plastics<00:02:15.900> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and that is I use tap plastics and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.490 
and that is I use tap plastics and
they're<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> marine<00:02:17.580> epoxy<00:02:18.060> system<00:02:18.680> which

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
they're a marine epoxy system which

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.229 
they're a marine epoxy system which
basically<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.740> two-part<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.400> it's

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
basically it's a two-part and it's

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.530 
basically it's a two-part and it's
non-toxic<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:26.300> one<00:02:27.300> hundred<00:02:27.510> percent<00:02:27.540> solid

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
non-toxic and one hundred percent solid

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.270 
non-toxic and one hundred percent solid
so<00:02:30.540> basically<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.739> using<00:02:31.920> for

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
so basically this is what I'm using for

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.760 
so basically this is what I'm using for
for<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> aquarium<00:02:32.970> decorations<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.770> after

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
for the aquarium decorations and after

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.620 
for the aquarium decorations and after
this<00:02:34.920> dries<00:02:35.190> I'll<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.489> throwing<00:02:35.730> throwing

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
this dries I'll be throwing throwing

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.140 
this dries I'll be throwing throwing
that<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.900> there<00:02:37.080> as<00:02:37.200> well<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:38.700> really<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
that in there as well now really if I

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.880 
that in there as well now really if I
really<00:02:39.959> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> make<00:02:40.290> sure<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:40.620> say<00:02:40.769> how

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
really want to make sure it will say how

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.380 
really want to make sure it will say how
I'm<00:02:40.950> pretty<00:02:41.190> sure<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.120> really

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
I'm pretty sure it is but if I really

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.940 
I'm pretty sure it is but if I really
want<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.570> make<00:02:42.660> sure<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.380> safe<00:02:43.500> basically

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
want to make sure it was safe basically

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.080 
want to make sure it was safe basically
I<00:02:43.980> probably<00:02:44.220> take<00:02:44.550> take<00:02:44.730> something<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
I probably take take something like a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.030 
I probably take take something like a
faceplate<00:02:45.570> drop<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.530> there<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.680> then<00:02:46.830> put

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
faceplate drop it in there and then put

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.060 
faceplate drop it in there and then put
a<00:02:47.070> feeder<00:02:47.340> fishing<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.739> inside<00:02:50.040> of

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
a feeder fishing in the on the inside of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.259 
a feeder fishing in the on the inside of
the<00:02:50.870> bucket<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:54.000> how<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the bucket there and then see how it

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.210 
the bucket there and then see how it
survives<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:55.350> kind<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.650> neat<00:02:55.800> thing<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.010> do

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
survives it's kind of a neat thing to do

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.640 
survives it's kind of a neat thing to do
but<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.750> instead<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.050> killing<00:02:58.260> all<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
but you know instead of killing all the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.100 
but you know instead of killing all the
fish<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.010> tank<00:02:59.220> you're<00:02:59.459> just<00:02:59.670> kind<00:02:59.850> of

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
fish in your tank you're just kind of

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.620 
fish in your tank you're just kind of
sacrificing<00:03:01.110> one<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.640> anyways<00:03:02.880> uh<00:03:02.910> let<00:03:03.600> me

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
sacrificing one so but anyways uh let me

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.960 
sacrificing one so but anyways uh let me
go<00:03:03.870> ahead<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.530> show<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.970> faceplate

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
go ahead and show you the faceplate

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.709 
go ahead and show you the faceplate
upstairs<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:07.380> my<00:03:07.500> fish<00:03:07.680> tank
