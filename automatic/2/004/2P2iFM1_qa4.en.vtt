00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.000
 you had appealed to me at good 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.790
 mouth because I have a form of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 expertise now on on the jewel and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.160
 I know that sir unfortunately there 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.449
 do not always know much about 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.949
 jewels and they need that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.270
 because women love jewelery 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 and today I would like to speak with 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 you from just buying a jewel of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.130
 general way how to offer a jewel to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 What is she who likes it? 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.539
 he does not like what is needed 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.539
 make 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.510
 but that's because you are 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.379
 men and you do not understand at all 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.600
 happens in a woman's head 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.879
 it's normal what is clear is that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 the jewel is the ultimate gift to the party 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.280
 the woman really does not like it and has 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.790
 some but it's still 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.860
 quite rare 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.180
 overall it will work a jewel on 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.590
 know that evil yard is overall all 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.699
 his life even a jewel that is not 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.660
 necessarily very good 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.370
 still something that is supposed 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.930
 last in time is symbolically 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.190
 very important because basically you 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.180
 Hire a little bit every time 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.500
 you are offering a jewel so I'm not going 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.210
 scare you gentlemen but 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 overall it's true that the woman is going 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.030
 will inevitably say it's a jewel it's 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.030
 still something that must last 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.540
 actually opportunities to offer 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.460
 jewelery there is a lot 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.020
 really the object as it will stay in 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.280
 the time that makes the mark 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020
 so all events a little 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.820
 important like that that means some 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.150
 thing in the long run basically the jewel is 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.150
 adapted 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.940
 what appeals most is the ring 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.230
 after the ring you have to do more 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.880
 be careful so if you are a little 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.130
 connoisseurs you know very 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.240
 well your mana or that where you have 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.530
 a very specific idea in mind 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.520
 I will go on the ring the loops 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.420
 what to know is 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.680
 that the person and the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.820
 pierced ears so it's a bit the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.170
 something to consider 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.160
 the other thing anyway to take in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.690
 consideration on the earring 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.950
 it's two stupid but it's 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.360
 it's a bit more expensive because it's actually 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.890
 twice as much work there are two 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 times the simplest metal of the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.100
 simpler is the necklace or the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.750
 pendant because it can be worn 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.250
 anywhere no matter how and the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.250
 bracelet is also a very good choice 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.710
 it really depends on the ring you're going 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.539
 choose for example here I have a model 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.069
 that I wear regularly in addition to 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.909
 the little finger that clearly does not make it 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.140
 an engagement ring 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.450
 it's a small sheet of jean cau 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.649
 it's more a sign of affection 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.450
 something a little more fashionable as a site 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.769
 offered a garment for example it's 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.280
 sure if you go on a ring of 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.260
 engagement 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.239
 for example here it's our bad love 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.890
 it's a sapphire it's yellow gold 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.000
 it makes engagement ring and a big 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.750
 number of banks that are not at all 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.099
 engagement ring 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.840
 as soon as you go on a jewel 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.220
 which is a bit more trendy that can 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.400
 quite afford for another 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.400
 opportunity 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.579
 globally for opportunities they 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.340
 are ready very important so christmas 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:34.000
 valentine's birthday 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.129
 something like between 100 and 300 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.810
 euros 400 euros it's already frankly 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.340
 a good budget as soon as you spend on 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.079
 more important occasions I do not think so 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.549
 wedding anniversary and then good bah 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.019
 obviously the engagement ring for 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.440
 these occasions there I would say he 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.120
 would ideally be m between 500 and after 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.620
 I want to say there is no 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.569
 limit but you have to start around 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.879
 500 fake already I think the first thing 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.170
 to say ok what opportunity the udc or is 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.400
 what it is an important occasion or 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.660
 not important if it's really 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.069
 important good I still have to 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.660
 know that for me it's a budget that 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.560
 is going to be as important even then it's 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.569
 a jewel she will keep all her 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 beds and after according to your 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.280
 personal budget how much can you m 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.410
 very simply a bit like for the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.520
 opportunities if ever the girl you the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.200
 have not known for a very long time 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.030
 must stay on purchases 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.319
 which are below 500 euros the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.970
 girl actually says luca launched nothing 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.900
 how much is it going to cost she realizes 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 when even when you're a big 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.390
 central stone 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.860
 it's going to cost a little bit of money and 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.490
 no call day I would avoid the big 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.110
 central stone 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.820
 I will leave either on a lot of small 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.040
 stones either on earrings 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.450
 pendants and and bracelets and there in 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.459
 general you are not going to plant yourself 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.140
 on the contrary, it is necessary not to skimp 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.580
 when it's an important moment 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.900
 so there in this kind of case just 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.250
 take a step back tell yourself 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.660
 ok how long have I been going out 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.370
 with her are we at a moment 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.959
 where still we start to really 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.410
 say it is strong and since it is 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.610
 opportunity 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.900
 is it a birthday of 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.790
 encounter where is it just to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.290
 valentine's day down at that moment when 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.610
 you have a little these elements there that 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.260
 you make your little gray and tell you 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.150
 ok it's a birthday meeting that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.140
 have been five years together as a father - 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.850
 begin to land a little 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.260
 questions I think that's where I have to 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.690
 make pretty earrings 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.390
 either a ring but a little 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.850
 more expensive so between 500 and above 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.750
 it will allow him to tell himself that I am 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.750
 I'm not fucking his mouth what 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.150
 personally I find that there is a 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.680
 huge misunderstanding 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.330
 so I do not know any woman who 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.800
 like to be offered a restaurant 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.210
 shame everyone in front of everyone 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.590
 the world is watching you the cup of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.610
 champagne with the ring in it but 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.550
 frankly it's mega kitsch 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.530
 frankly I will avoid 100% cons 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.650
 go to the restaurant make a nice dinner 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.330
 and then on entering or in 1 in a 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.150
 bar a little cozy or at home 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.340
 to offer a jewel there frankly it is 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.020
 more is more suitable I would say that the 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.590
 will do more like that rather than typing 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.840
 the sheet 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.670
 the girl I think that's what he 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.220
 it is necessary to prepare a little his speech 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.270
 of yesterday that to offer a jewel is often 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.610
 symbolic that's what I like 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.900
 always repeated is actually if ever 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.070
 you offer young does not matter what does 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.020
 would this pendant be a 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.940
 pendant beautiful diamond that rating 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.860
 around 400 euros that if you offer it 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.330
 this jewel down you just have to 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.500
 explain why you did the 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.200
 step to offer him a jewel 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.300
 because you want to be served that 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.639
 you like it 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.229
 you want to be excused for something 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.639
 thing I do not know but tell a 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.870
 story still about jewelry it's 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.099
 important because it helps 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.110
 completely to the effect it takes 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.759
 absolutely absolutely put that in a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.800
 where there is a beautiful light so 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.479
 typically if you go home in 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.220
 finally do you have to try to 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.139
 put near a lamp preferably 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.490
 with leds it's going a lot I see if 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.500
 you offer a jewel in a box 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.819
 it's already an effect beef for little 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.110
 you have a good light and a good 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.669
 speech you do not need to do 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.110
 much more than that I will stay 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.819
 quietly at home to offer the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.139
 jewel is more intimate and a jewel 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.030
 this is something we Respondent door 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.949
 on oneself so much as much to stay there 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.389
 above and who knows is more 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.629
 she will thank you that you 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.629
 want 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:50.899
 good
