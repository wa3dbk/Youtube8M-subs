I've<00:03:29.340> got<00:03:29.690> 20<00:03:30.690> mm<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.710> a<00:03:31.800> bit<00:03:32.160> behind<00:03:32.610> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
I've got 20 mm I was a bit behind the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.110 
I've got 20 mm I was a bit behind the
others<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.510> I'm<00:03:33.810> picking<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.380> up<00:03:35.120> it's

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
others but I'm picking it up it's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.930 
others but I'm picking it up it's
actually<00:03:36.390> becoming<00:03:36.990> easier<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:38.250> more<00:03:38.280> notes

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
actually becoming easier the more notes

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.560 
actually becoming easier the more notes
are<00:03:39.930> coming<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:40.680> because<00:03:41.570> it's

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
are coming on there because it's

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.630 
are coming on there because it's
becoming<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:43.050> bit<00:03:43.200> more<00:03:43.230> instinctual<00:03:43.890> than

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
becoming a bit more instinctual than

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.510 
becoming a bit more instinctual than
trying<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.810> follow<00:03:45.990> it<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:47.250> feel

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
trying to follow it so I can feel

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.850 
trying to follow it so I can feel
naturally<00:03:48.300> where<00:03:48.840> my<00:03:49.080> hands<00:03:49.320> should<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.590> going

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
naturally where my hands should be going

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.680 
naturally where my hands should be going
next<00:03:50.070> as<00:03:50.310> opposed<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.700> trying<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.360> think<00:03:51.570> about

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
next as opposed to trying to think about

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.780 
next as opposed to trying to think about
where<00:03:52.110> my<00:03:52.320> eyes<00:03:52.470> should<00:03:52.710> be<00:03:52.830> looking<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.520> that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
where my eyes should be looking if that

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.580 
where my eyes should be looking if that
makes<00:03:54.330> sense<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.720> anyone<00:03:54.990> else<00:03:55.140> there<00:03:55.380> is

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
makes sense of anyone else there is

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.470 
makes sense of anyone else there is
guitarists<00:03:56.340> you'll<00:03:56.430> probably<00:03:56.580> get<00:03:57.240> what<00:03:57.450> I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
guitarists you'll probably get what I

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.820 
guitarists you'll probably get what I
mean

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
mean

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
mean
so<00:03:58.830> onwards<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.670> upwards<00:03:59.730> I<00:04:00.150> guess<00:04:00.450> and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
so onwards and upwards I guess and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.800 
so onwards and upwards I guess and
hopefully<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:02.520> harder<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.000> gets<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.420> easier

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
hopefully the harder it gets the easier

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.870 
hopefully the harder it gets the easier
it<00:04:03.960> gets<00:04:04.110> if<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.830> makes<00:04:05.040> any<00:04:05.100> sense

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
it gets if that makes any sense

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:24.640 
it gets if that makes any sense

okay so last week and I actually made a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.129 
okay so last week and I actually made a
bit<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.820> an<00:04:29.880> error<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.300> was<00:04:30.810> playing<00:04:31.020> on<00:04:31.050> the

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
bit of an error I was playing on the

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.200 
bit of an error I was playing on the
wrong<00:04:31.230> motors<00:04:31.560> plan<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.830> combo<00:04:32.250> sounds<00:04:32.910> mixing

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
wrong motors plan on combo sounds mixing

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.870 
wrong motors plan on combo sounds mixing
the<00:04:33.300> single<00:04:33.660> notes<00:04:33.870> with<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.280> chords<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.550> was

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
the single notes with a chords so I was

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.550 
the single notes with a chords so I was
obviously<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.530> slightly<00:04:37.530> high<00:04:37.650> score<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.870> I've

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
obviously a slightly high score so I've

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.960 
obviously a slightly high score so I've
gone<00:04:40.680> back<00:04:40.860> into<00:04:41.100> how<00:04:41.460> everyone<00:04:41.729> else<00:04:41.790> is

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
gone back into how everyone else is

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.480 
gone back into how everyone else is
playing<00:04:42.120> now<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.800> I've<00:04:43.800> tried<00:04:44.040> again<00:04:44.280> so

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
playing now and I've tried again so

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.770 
playing now and I've tried again so
that's<00:04:44.729> why<00:04:44.910> I've<00:04:45.000> got<00:04:45.120> quite<00:04:45.449> a<00:04:45.510> lot<00:04:45.750> of

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
that's why I've got quite a lot of

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.960 
that's why I've got quite a lot of
school<00:04:46.050> it's<00:04:46.610> 9,900<00:04:47.610> before<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:49.580> think<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.910> I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
school it's 9,900 before I think that I

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.300 
school it's 9,900 before I think that I
think<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.210> bit<00:04:51.360> okay<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.930> still<00:04:52.800> few<00:04:53.100> things

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
think a bit okay and still few things

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.840 
think a bit okay and still few things
that<00:04:53.460> formatic<00:04:53.850> like<00:04:54.000> dangling<00:04:54.389> said<00:04:54.660> as<00:04:54.750> well

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
that formatic like dangling said as well

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.280 
that formatic like dangling said as well
the<00:04:56.850> whole<00:04:57.000> song<00:04:57.240> gets<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> more<00:04:57.690> notary's

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
the whole song gets the more notary's

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.920 
the whole song gets the more notary's
the<00:04:58.889> more<00:04:59.070> knows<00:04:59.220> there<00:04:59.370> are<00:04:59.510> you<00:05:00.510> can<00:05:00.660> sort<00:05:00.900> of

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
the more knows there are you can sort of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.320 
the more knows there are you can sort of
get<00:05:01.470> into<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.710> bit<00:05:01.919> more<00:05:02.100> because<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.910> hard<00:05:03.150> to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
get into a bit more because it's hard to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.120 
get into a bit more because it's hard to
sort<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.870> saw<00:05:04.080> you've<00:05:04.560> got<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.800> notes<00:05:04.979> in

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
sort of you saw you've got the notes in

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.379 
sort of you saw you've got the notes in
your<00:05:05.250> head<00:05:05.370> whereas<00:05:05.729> this<00:05:05.910> it's<00:05:06.120> sort<00:05:06.240> of

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
your head whereas this it's sort of

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.590 
your head whereas this it's sort of
you're<00:05:06.930> playing<00:05:07.169> segments<00:05:10.310> go<00:05:11.310> next<00:05:12.150> week<00:05:12.300> but

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
you're playing segments go next week but

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.100 
you're playing segments go next week but
way<00:05:13.139> too<00:05:13.169> soon<00:05:13.470> I'm<00:05:13.800> behind<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.639> week<00:05:15.110> so

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
way too soon I'm behind a week so

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.870 
way too soon I'm behind a week so
whatever<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.590> means<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.160> do<00:05:17.220> not<00:05:17.430> know<00:05:17.610> but

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
whatever that means I do not know but

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.610 
whatever that means I do not know but
let's<00:05:18.479> let's<00:05:18.690> see<00:05:18.840> where<00:05:19.200> we're<00:05:19.320> getting<00:05:19.410> in

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
let's let's see where we're getting in

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.430 
let's let's see where we're getting in
the<00:05:19.680> future<00:05:20.010> so<00:05:20.970> there<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.270> week<00:05:21.720> two<00:05:22.020> done

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
the future so there it is week two done

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.010 
the future so there it is week two done
and<00:05:22.650> dusted<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.520> lot<00:05:23.760> of<00:05:23.850> improvement<00:05:24.510> by

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
and dusted a lot of improvement by

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.590 
and dusted a lot of improvement by
everyone<00:05:25.770> we<00:05:26.370> except<00:05:26.729> for<00:05:26.880> Erin<00:05:27.180> but<00:05:27.389> that's

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
everyone we except for Erin but that's

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.390 
everyone we except for Erin but that's
what<00:05:27.810> happens<00:05:28.229> when<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.560> start<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.220> wrong

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
what happens when you start on the wrong

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.460 
what happens when you start on the wrong
level<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.030> then<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:30.660> force<00:05:30.840> play<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.139> bit<00:05:31.440> of

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
level and then you force play a bit of

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.310 
level and then you force play a bit of
catch-up<00:05:31.770> but<00:05:32.510> hopefully<00:05:33.510> he'll<00:05:33.810> he'll

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
catch-up but hopefully he'll he'll

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.320 
catch-up but hopefully he'll he'll
spring<00:05:34.620> back<00:05:34.800> into<00:05:35.039> position<00:05:35.160> with<00:05:35.580> us<00:05:35.760> if<00:05:36.210> he

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
spring back into position with us if he

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.510 
spring back into position with us if he
was<00:05:36.419> playing<00:05:36.570> combo<00:05:36.990> mode<00:05:37.229> ahead<00:05:37.979> of<00:05:38.100> us<00:05:38.250> and

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
was playing combo mode ahead of us and

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.969 
was playing combo mode ahead of us and
scoring<00:05:39.030> well<00:05:39.180> on<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.479> then<00:05:39.840> there's<00:05:40.830> really

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
scoring well on that then there's really
