on his way to becoming sort of like an
all-powerful<00:02:25.069> Jedi<00:02:25.969> and<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.420> know<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.749> tune

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
with the force as the last Jedi around

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.000 
with the force as the last Jedi around
at<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.209> point<00:02:29.510> or<00:02:29.659> that<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.870> know<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.379> think

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
at this point or that we know of I think

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.470 
at this point or that we know of I think
that<00:02:31.129> also<00:02:31.310> ties<00:02:31.609> into<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.180> rumors<00:02:32.450> that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
that also ties into the rumors that

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.959 
that also ties into the rumors that
Daisy<00:02:33.139> Ridley's<00:02:33.560> character<00:02:33.950> plays<00:02:34.280> Han<00:02:34.730> Solo

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
Daisy Ridley's character plays Han Solo

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.490 
Daisy Ridley's character plays Han Solo
and<00:02:35.030> Princess<00:02:35.090> Leia's<00:02:35.569> daughter<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.170> she<00:02:36.349> can

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
and Princess Leia's daughter and she can

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.869 
and Princess Leia's daughter and she can
use<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.769> force<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.519> would<00:02:37.609> be<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> good

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
use the force and that would be a good

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.309 
use the force and that would be a good
way<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.120> containing<00:02:38.389> this<00:02:38.629> scholar<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.169> life

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.530 
rumors I wouldn't depth that one would
be<00:03:06.469> one<00:03:07.129> of<00:03:07.250> first<00:03:07.489> ones<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.030> they<00:03:08.150> send<00:03:08.389> it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
be one of first ones that they send it

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.890 
be one of first ones that they send it
yeah<00:03:09.579> so<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.609> guess<00:03:10.849> that's<00:03:11.239> really<00:03:11.510> about<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
yeah so I guess that's really about it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.509 
yeah so I guess that's really about it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
think like maybe it's true it could be

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.939 
think like maybe it's true it could be
true<00:03:15.889> we<00:03:16.069> never<00:03:16.250> know<00:03:16.400> well<00:03:16.879> don't<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.449> until

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
true we never know well don't know until

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.020

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.219 
his character plays an imperial officer

who defects and now you have the Sun on

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.379 
who defects and now you have the Sun on
the<00:03:30.259> rebels<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.099> are<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.729> father<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.269> the

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
the rebels and the are the father on the

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.420 
the rebels and the are the father on the
rebels<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.049> son<00:03:33.259> on<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.739> Imperials<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
rebels and the son on the Imperials and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.770 
rebels and the son on the Imperials and
what's<00:03:34.699> that<00:03:34.939> tension

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
what's that tension

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.330 
what's that tension
I<00:03:35.810> don't<00:03:36.319> think<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:36.680> there<00:03:36.829> is<00:03:36.919> that<00:03:37.069> rumor

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
I don't think so there is that rumor

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.530 
I don't think so there is that rumor
flowing<00:03:37.639> around<00:03:37.729> but<00:03:37.939> I<00:03:37.970> think<00:03:38.150> that's<00:03:38.269> john

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
flowing around but I think that's john

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.849 
flowing around but I think that's john
boyega's<00:03:38.989> character<00:03:39.409> because<00:03:39.620> he's<00:03:39.739> clearly

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
boyega's character because he's clearly

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.710 
boyega's character because he's clearly
a<00:03:40.099> stormtrooper<00:03:40.579> yeah<00:03:41.060> it's<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.419> trailer

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
a stormtrooper yeah it's in the trailer

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.659 
a stormtrooper yeah it's in the trailer
as<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.840> stormtrooper<00:03:42.259> but<00:03:42.979> then<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.370> seems

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
as a stormtrooper but then it seems

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.460 
as a stormtrooper but then it seems
implied<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.090> he<00:03:44.180> can<00:03:44.329> feel<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.750> force<00:03:44.930> yeah

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
implied that he can feel the force yeah

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.780 
implied that he can feel the force yeah
and<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.709> rumor<00:03:45.979> is<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.069> then<00:03:46.340> he<00:03:46.549> would<00:03:46.699> then

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and the rumor is that then he would then

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.089 
and the rumor is that then he would then
go<00:03:46.970> with<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.150> rebels<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.780> get<00:03:47.959> trained<00:03:48.500> yeah

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
go with the rebels and get trained yeah

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.499 
go with the rebels and get trained yeah
so<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.579> think<00:03:49.669> that's<00:03:49.909> where<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.180> comes<00:03:50.359> from

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
so I think that's where that comes from

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.379 
so I think that's where that comes from
but<00:03:50.840> who<00:03:51.109> knows<00:03:51.349> so<00:03:52.069> leave<00:03:52.669> us<00:03:52.699> your<00:03:53.329> feedback
