00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.029 
he's going to check most flops there
okay<00:01:29.960> because<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.380> reason<00:01:30.500> isn't<00:01:30.740> check<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
okay because the reason isn't check the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.639 
okay because the reason isn't check the
flop<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:32.359> I'm<00:01:32.659> supposed<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.350> make<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
flop is because I'm supposed to make the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.800 
flop is because I'm supposed to make the
continuation<00:01:34.340> bet<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.000> just<00:01:35.299> because<00:01:35.479> he

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
continuation bet so just because he

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.240 
continuation bet so just because he
checks<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.140> flop<00:01:36.350> doesn't<00:01:36.679> mean<00:01:36.799> he<00:01:36.979> doesn't

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
checks the flop doesn't mean he doesn't

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.120 
checks the flop doesn't mean he doesn't
have<00:01:37.280> aces<00:01:37.700> kings<00:01:37.880> or<00:01:38.119> Queens<00:01:38.649> so<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:39.679> checked

aces or kings I'm going to get paid but
judging<00:02:29.490> from<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> action<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.240> think

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
judging from the action I don't think

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.790

he's<00:02:30.480> got<00:02:30.630> HD<00:02:30.930> Kings<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.440> he

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
he's got HD Kings because I think he

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.860 
he's got HD Kings because I think he

would have had to obviously have bet the
river<00:02:34.140> at<00:02:34.320> least<00:02:34.560> he<00:02:35.100> could<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.310> slowed

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
river at least he could have slowed
