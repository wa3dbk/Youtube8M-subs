trying to remember what this cost me I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.320

think<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.340> was<00:02:33.370> something<00:02:33.760> around<00:02:33.930> about<00:02:36.330> 1516

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
think it was something around about 1516

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.750 
think it was something around about 1516
bucks<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.110> machete<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.310> sheath<00:02:39.550> was

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.839 

slippery<00:03:28.459> let's<00:03:29.180> see<00:03:29.420> what<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:29.659> can<00:03:30.849> market

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.949 

very<00:03:37.569> wobbly<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.409> let's<00:03:38.530> hope<00:03:38.709> this<00:03:38.859> cuts<00:03:39.159> good

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.300 

how's<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.519> that's<00:03:45.519> that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:57.660 

let's<00:03:48.910> hope<00:03:49.360> before<00:03:56.340> see<00:03:57.340> if<00:03:57.400> we<00:03:57.520> can

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
let's hope before see if we can

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:09.780 
let's hope before see if we can
replicate<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.300> again<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.990> perfect<00:03:59.950> hit<00:04:08.790> cut

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
replicate that again a perfect hit cut

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.809 
replicate that again a perfect hit cut
it<00:04:09.910> off<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:10.330> knocked<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.720> over<00:04:11.670> one<00:04:12.670> last

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
it off but I knocked it over one last

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.080 
it off but I knocked it over one last
try<00:04:13.239> I'm<00:04:13.720> already<00:04:14.020> a<00:04:14.200> winner<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:15.069> it's<00:04:15.790> one<00:04:15.940> do

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
try I'm already a winner but it's one do

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.259 
try I'm already a winner but it's one do
it<00:04:16.180> one<00:04:16.299> more<00:04:16.329> time

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
it one more time

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.580 
it one more time
I'll<00:04:19.269> try<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.660> hit<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.959> little<00:04:20.109> bit<00:04:20.260> further

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
I'll try and hit it a little bit further

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:32.160 
I'll try and hit it a little bit further
down<00:04:20.680> in<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.040> belly<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.579> time

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.900 

it's<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:33.440> sharp<00:04:33.800> not<00:04:34.070> only<00:04:34.310> did<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.490> take<00:04:34.790> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
it's so sharp not only did it take the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.590 
it's so sharp not only did it take the
top<00:04:35.180> off<00:04:35.420> but<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.020> was<00:04:36.140> so<00:04:36.380> fast<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:37.220> quickly

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
top off but it was so fast it quickly

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.210 
top off but it was so fast it quickly
cut<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.750> label<00:04:39.140> off<00:04:39.290> so<00:04:39.500> fast<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.950> couldn't

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
cut the label off so fast you couldn't

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.840 
cut the label off so fast you couldn't
even<00:04:40.280> see<00:04:40.670> it

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
even see it

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.930 
even see it
now<00:04:41.600> that's<00:04:41.780> sharp<00:04:42.430> that's<00:04:43.430> something<00:04:43.850> you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
now that's sharp that's something you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.320 
now that's sharp that's something you
don't<00:04:44.030> normally<00:04:44.210> see<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.750> bottle<00:04:45.080> test

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
don't normally see in a bottle test

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.500 
don't normally see in a bottle test
so<00:04:48.010> definitely<00:04:51.490> passes<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.700> bottle<00:04:53.210> cutting

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
so definitely passes the bottle cutting

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.980 
so definitely passes the bottle cutting
test<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:54.230> thing<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:55.330> really<00:04:56.330> scary<00:04:57.020> shorts

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990
