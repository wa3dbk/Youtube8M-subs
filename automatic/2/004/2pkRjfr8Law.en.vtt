00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.899
Welcome to the Investors Trading Academy event
of the week.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.090
Each week our staff of educators tries to
introduce you to a person of interest in the

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.340
financial world.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.330
This could be a person in government or banking
or an important investors or trader.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.109
Over the next coming months ITA will take
a look into each US Presidential candidate.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.339
In this video we are going to take a look
at Jeb Bush.

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.650
Jeb Bush had a plan for the last six months
he spent as an unannounced candidate for president.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.740
He would raise tens of millions of dollars,
distinguish himself from his brother’s controversial

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.590
presidency, start winning over conservatives
and establish himself as the Republican to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.110
beat for his party’s nomination.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.460
Other than raising the money, little has gone
as he had hoped.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.330
He has been torn between defending and distancing
himself from George W. Bush, been unable to

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.680
assuage party activists uneasy with his immigration
and education views, and run into a wall of

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.120
opposition on the right.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.780
And now, as he prepares to make his candidacy
official on Monday, Mr. Bush finds himself

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
in a position he could not have imagined:
Part of a pack of candidates, and the target

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.399
of questions about his own competence and
conservatism.

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.180
Jeb Bush served as governor of Florida from
1999 to 2007.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.119
He also ran unsuccessfully for governor in
1994.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.829
He is the son of the 41st president, George
H.W. Bush, and brother of the 43rd president,

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.560
George W. Bush.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.500
Bush grew up in Houston, Texas.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.600
He graduated from the Phillips Academy in
Andover, Massachusetts and attended the University

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.229
of Texas, where he earned a degree in Latin
American affairs.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.889
Following his father's successful run for
Vice President in 1980, he moved to Florida

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:45.359
and pursued a career in real estate development.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.219
In 1986, Bush was named Florida's Secretary
of Commerce, a position he held until his

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.950
resignation in 1988 to help his father's successful
campaign for the Presidency.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.579
In 1994, Bush made his first run for office,
narrowly losing the election for governor

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.950
by less than two percentage points to the
incumbent Lawton Chiles.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.840
Bush ran again in 1998 and beat Lieutenant
Governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
vote.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.569
He ran for reelection in 2002 and won with
56 percent to become Florida's first two-term

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.600
Republican governor.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.470
During his eight years as governor, Bush was
credited with initiating environmental improvements,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.019
such as conservation in the Everglades, supporting
caps for medical malpractice litigation, moving

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.150
Medicaid recipients to private systems, and
instituting reforms to the state education

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.200
system, including the issuance of vouchers
and promoting school choice.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.350
Frequently cited by the media as a possible
candidate for president in 2016, in mid-December

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.980
2014, Bush announced he would explore the
possibility of running for President, a campaign

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.629
he is expected to formally launch on in the
next days.
