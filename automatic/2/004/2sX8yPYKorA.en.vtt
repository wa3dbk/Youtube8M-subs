00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.049
 you have to imagine that I am 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.049
 say now 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.750
 increase the us show the on the six 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 Kartellamt missed by Zander he was 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.830
 there was 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 go 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.270
 haywards lisa zaiser are not allowed 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.400
 forget about the austrian woman 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.400
 is on the train 2 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.590
 so and now comes which then 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.850
 that comes as if it stops 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.990
 I'm really up at noon 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 co-founder is still a race 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.320
 but in between is not 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.129
 out of the water into the water like 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.870
 should go 200 levels on the level 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.440
 after you do not care about 800 kroll 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.659
 when exactly that rust is there that is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 the big favorite defending champion 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.649
 Europe's swimmers of the year and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
 and and but I also want Lisa 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.869
 emperors have come back strong ever since 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.250
 in Linz it at marco wolf than the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.100
 real progress made 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.289
 It was also in finished fights 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.369
 canceled but you can tell that it is 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.440
 maybe one too 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 She can attack a bit further ahead 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.259
 said before the contest between 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.700
 five and ten is mine too 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.369
 Paradise everything in it 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
 that she can reach now favorite 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.310
 on the 4th 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.830
 with brave they can both of us 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.530
 do not really imagine that 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.850
 What breaks gives the others chances 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.710
 So she also knows that herself 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 no chance against horst shoe has 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 I think it's about her 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.180
 here's another medal win this is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 i believe c Europe very seriously 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320
 I do not have the imagination 800 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.299
 Freestyle and the desert is the limit 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.610
 go 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.700
 that is very very difficult so imperial 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.009
 So it speaks on the train two that it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
 the second of nonsense 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.830
 for them it is also about the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.500
 qualification just for the sake of 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.979
 to create world championships that is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.069
 very important for kalkar at the next 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:16.010
 year 214 65 is that time 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.590
 those with wenders austrians so the limit 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.269
 actually always floats to hoard gold 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.159
 We do not have to worry so much now 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.230
 Above all, do not work on this back 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.900
 distance because she is very very strong 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.560
 it's the us show on the six 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.170
 is still in the race found the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.000
 Dutchwoman is also present 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.189
 the need now actually exactly well 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.159
 the first three to be there and turn 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.719
 Belmonte Garcia is the eighth of the GC hostel 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.379
 I said that, so the school here 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:48.469
 everything else is impossible or she 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.060
 was named surname phelps in front 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:54.469
 the us show at second position then yes 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.359
 also watched as we as a school 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.330
 Siblings of the daddy is still like 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.900
 but before trainer 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.620
 who is no longer here at the pool with 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.360
 the contact to his ladys law school 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.940
 has lost a bit on the chest 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.010
 that is normal too 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.010
 nevertheless she has a big big one 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.260
 Leap is coming that is known for 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.180
 the great sport and look shit 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.920

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.700
 java look there again 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.560
 someone at a European record at 1900 at 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.620
 the 150 meters hold tight 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.950
 Europe made a record we 20 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.590
 746 held by her and what happens 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.629
 behind it also down the fan 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.349
 two still swim around one 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.959
 bronze medal with science arthrose 20 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.950

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.650

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.870
 take care 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:59.560
 but that is very strong 2 12 17 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.650
 The time for Austria is two 14 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.530
 65 the standard time with it it has also quasi 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.470
 already the olympic games 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.760
 poised great achievement by 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.280
 this time 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.669
 Of course, from high to high and wants 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.669
 mozilla's a super finish as 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.860
 so they always have a few 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.570
 impressions so katinka hosszu the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.840
 strong european swimmer of the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.300

 that is, if you always nice to the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.710
 final comes through in most 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.830
 bachelor should not see any again 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.639
