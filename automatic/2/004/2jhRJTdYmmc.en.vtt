i<00:00:01.740> also<00:00:02.740> i<00:00:03.250> just<00:00:03.999> want<00:00:04.359> to<00:00:04.450> shove<00:00:04.660> I'm<00:00:04.839> going<00:00:05.200> to

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
i also i just want to shove I'm going to

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.860 
i also i just want to shove I'm going to
regulate<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:05.859> dream<00:00:06.100> again<00:00:06.600> because<00:00:07.600> if<00:00:07.720> it's

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
regulate the dream again because if it's

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:21.740 
regulate the dream again because if it's
gaining<00:00:08.170> around<00:00:09.179> 60<00:00:10.179> seconds<00:00:10.650> 16<00:00:11.650> so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:38.340 

make<00:00:22.750> it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.140 

this<00:00:39.350> is<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.560> bit<00:00:39.740> much<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:42.640> think<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:43.760> oh<00:00:43.790> no<00:00:44.090> you

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
this is a bit much I think I oh no you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.200 
this is a bit much I think I oh no you
can<00:00:44.450> regulate<00:00:44.780> every<00:00:45.460> mechanical<00:00:46.460> watch<00:00:46.640> you

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
can regulate every mechanical watch you

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.590 
can regulate every mechanical watch you
can<00:00:47.390> see<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.750> bit<00:00:47.930> error<00:00:48.080> is<00:00:48.410> quite<00:00:49.100> big<00:00:49.340> but

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
can see the bit error is quite big but

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.560 
can see the bit error is quite big but
this<00:00:50.600> is<00:00:50.809> unstable<00:00:51.500> because<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.100> watch<00:00:52.280> is

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
this is unstable because the watch is

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.430 
this is unstable because the watch is
around<00:00:53.570> 30<00:00:53.720> years<00:00:54.050> old<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.309> needs<00:00:55.610> service

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
around 30 years old so it needs service

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.660 
around 30 years old so it needs service
you<00:00:57.440> can<00:00:57.620> see<00:00:57.830> here<00:00:58.460> if<00:00:59.420> we<00:00:59.570> can<00:00:59.750> move<00:01:00.400> this<00:01:01.400> one

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
you can see here if we can move this one

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.439 
you can see here if we can move this one
to<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.559> right<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:04.100> will<00:01:04.339> go<00:01:04.489> slower<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:05.300> the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
to the right it will go slower to the

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.440 
to the right it will go slower to the
left<00:01:05.660> will<00:01:05.990> go<00:01:06.170> faster<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:07.190> don't<00:01:07.910> move<00:01:08.090> this

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
left will go faster this don't move this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:32.290 
left will go faster this don't move this
side<00:01:08.810> only<00:01:09.380> decide

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.290 

it<00:01:33.300> looks<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.690> we<00:01:33.960> haven't<00:01:34.290> been<00:01:34.440> up<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:38.300> this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
it looks like we haven't been up so this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.030 
it looks like we haven't been up so this
should<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.870> acceptable<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.650> me<00:01:41.960> yeah<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:47.010> I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
should be acceptable for me yeah so I

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
should be acceptable for me yeah so I
will<00:01:47.280> keep<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.730> way<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.300> see<00:01:48.840> how<00:01:49.230> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
will keep it this way and see how it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:00.440 
will keep it this way and see how it
will<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:53.960> what<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.110> he<00:01:55.260> now<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
will go so what is he now so this was a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
will go so what is he now so this was a
regulating<00:02:01.230> of<00:02:02.060> pretty<00:02:03.060> much<00:02:03.090> motive<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:04.020> know

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
regulating of pretty much motive I know

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.430 
regulating of pretty much motive I know
there<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.550> dose<00:02:06.479> limit<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.990> quite<00:02:07.200> different

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
there is a dose limit is quite different

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.190 
there is a dose limit is quite different
because<00:02:07.680> too<00:02:08.070> much<00:02:08.220> regulate<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.330> 30<00:02:09.929> days

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
because too much regulate it for 30 days

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.490 
because too much regulate it for 30 days
in<00:02:10.640> different<00:02:11.640> temperatures<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.660> atc<00:02:13.290> but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
in different temperatures and atc but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.150 
in different temperatures and atc but
it's<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:15.540> slovakia<00:02:16.050> probably<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.620> like

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
it's now in slovakia probably have like

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's now in slovakia probably have like
minutes<00:02:17.820> 10<00:02:18.030> minutes<00:02:18.180> 15<00:02:18.480> by<00:02:19.230> basil<00:02:21.050> sizes<00:02:22.050> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
minutes 10 minutes 15 by basil sizes so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.980 
minutes 10 minutes 15 by basil sizes so
this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.920> quite<00:02:23.250> good<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.880> me<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:26.780> again<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
this is quite good for me so again that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.940 
this is quite good for me so again that
were<00:02:28.140> regulating<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.950> pain<00:02:29.220> watch<00:02:30.830> thank<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
were regulating of pain watch thank you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.250 
were regulating of pain watch thank you
for<00:02:32.100> watching
