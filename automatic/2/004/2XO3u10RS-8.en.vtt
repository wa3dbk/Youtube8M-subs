to<00:00:13.799> build<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.219> triple<00:00:14.700> piston<00:00:15.089> extender<00:00:15.509> BAM

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
to build a triple piston extender BAM

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.269 
to build a triple piston extender BAM
alright<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.029> thing<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> horizontal<00:00:19.279> it

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
alright so this thing is horizontal it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.620 
pain um yeah he basically just put a
common<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> built<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> triple

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
common take and you built a triple

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.209 
common take and you built a triple
piston<00:00:36.899> extender<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> sure<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
piston extender and I'm like sure you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
piston extender and I'm like sure you
know<00:00:38.309> vertical<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.879> horizontal<00:00:39.260> like<00:00:40.260> feeling

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
know vertical or horizontal like feeling

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
know vertical or horizontal like feeling
super-confident<00:00:41.399> after<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.030> had<00:00:42.360> made<00:00:42.629> my

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
super-confident after I had made my

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.889 
super-confident after I had made my
flesh<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> waterfall<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
flesh one with the waterfall one so I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.940 
flesh one with the waterfall one so I
was<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.110> yeah<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.620> can't<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
was like yeah you know it can't be that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.549 
was like yeah you know it can't be that
hard<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.570> he<00:00:48.750> didn't<00:00:48.960> answer<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
hard but you know he didn't answer so I

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.830 
hard but you know he didn't answer so I
went<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> horizontal<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.690> know

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
went with a horizontal one and you know

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
went with a horizontal one and you know
I<00:00:51.870> went<00:00:52.079> through<00:00:52.170> some<00:00:52.440> steps<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.129> was

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I went through some steps and I was

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.330 
I went through some steps and I was
trying<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> make<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.850> thing<00:00:54.090> work<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.129> yeah

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
trying to make this thing work and yeah

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.979 
trying to make this thing work and yeah
eventually<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:59.300> this<00:01:00.300> point<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
eventually I got to this point with this

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.760 
eventually I got to this point with this
one<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.149> almost<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.960> almost<00:01:06.770> see

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
one and I was almost there almost see

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
one and I was almost there almost see
I'm<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.270> retract

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
I'm just gonna get this one to retract

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
I'm just gonna get this one to retract
like<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> pull<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> block<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.490> tried<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
like to pull back the block I tried a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
like to pull back the block I tried a
bunch<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> variations<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.409> coming<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.830> here

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
bunch of variations like coming up here

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
bunch of variations like coming up here
with<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.250> redstone<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.930> make<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> work

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
with some redstone just can make it work

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.030 
with some redstone just can make it work
I<00:01:17.000> was<00:01:18.000> fiddling<00:01:18.450> around<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> flush

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I was fiddling around with like a flush

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.590 
I was fiddling around with like a flush
nether<00:01:20.340> portal<00:01:20.729> thing<00:01:20.909> I've<00:01:21.240> seen<00:01:21.390> other

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
nether portal thing I've seen other

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
nether portal thing I've seen other
people<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
people on do these so I was kind of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.609 
people on do these so I was kind of
working<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.880> own<00:01:24.049> but<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.409> now<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
working on my own but I was like now you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
working on my own but I was like now you
know<00:01:25.979> let's<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.909> back<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> triple<00:01:27.630> piston

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
know let's get back to the triple piston

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.350 
know let's get back to the triple piston
extender<00:01:28.340> eventually<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.520> came<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
extender eventually I came up with a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
extender eventually I came up with a
design<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> uses<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.229> torch<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.890> basically

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
design that uses a torch here basically

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.840 
design that uses a torch here basically
I<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.540> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> counting<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> freakout

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
I was kind of counting on the freakout

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
I was kind of counting on the freakout
to<00:01:35.850> send<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> signal<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
to send a signal around and the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.499 
to send a signal around and the
problematic<00:01:38.759> piston<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.540> extend<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.520> did

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
problematic piston to extend and I did

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.880 
problematic piston to extend and I did
it<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.840> felt<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> freaking<00:01:44.100> redstone<00:01:44.729> boss

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
it I felt like a freaking redstone boss

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.270 
it I felt like a freaking redstone boss
the<00:01:46.890> weird<00:01:47.130> part<00:01:47.399> though<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.890> once<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.040> went<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the weird part though is once I went to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.630 
the weird part though is once I went to
do<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.490> video<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:52.259> refuses<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> work<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
do the video it refuses to work the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.539 
do the video it refuses to work the
direction<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> same<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.100> build<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
direction is all the same the build is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.300 
direction is all the same the build is
exactly<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.299> same<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.780> refuses<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.619> work<00:01:58.770> like

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
exactly the same it refuses to work like

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
exactly the same it refuses to work like
it<00:01:59.490> works<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:03.380> I'm<00:02:04.380> seeing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it works right there but I'm seeing

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
it works right there but I'm seeing
that's<00:02:04.950> working<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.490> piece<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> crap

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.080 

okay<00:02:10.629> there<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.560> was<00:02:12.159> happening<00:02:12.579> a<00:02:12.700> lot<00:02:12.879> more

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
okay there that was happening a lot more

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.679 
okay there that was happening a lot more
often

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
often

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.720 
often
it<00:02:13.840> was<00:02:14.409> just<00:02:14.680> refusing<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.220> work<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.610> other

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
it was just refusing to work the other

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.259 
it was just refusing to work the other
one<00:02:16.409> works<00:02:17.409> every<00:02:18.310> time<00:02:18.549> like<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.000> never

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
one works every time like it's never

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.960 
one works every time like it's never
failed<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.010> had<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.640> make<00:02:21.760> some

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
failed so I had to make some

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.819 
failed so I had to make some
modifications<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.349> came<00:02:23.620> up<00:02:23.799> with

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
modifications to it and I came up with

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.569 
modifications to it and I came up with
this<00:02:24.099> one<00:02:24.340> which<00:02:24.610> now<00:02:25.260> after<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.579> hundreds

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
this one which now after like hundreds

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.420 
this one which now after like hundreds
of<00:02:27.760> tests<00:02:28.000> well<00:02:28.209> maybe<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.780> much<00:02:29.170> but

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
of tests well maybe not that much but

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
of tests well maybe not that much but
dozens<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.579> tests<00:02:30.909> um<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.540> works<00:02:32.049> every<00:02:32.500> single

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
dozens of tests um it works every single

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.030 
dozens of tests um it works every single
time<00:02:33.329> now<00:02:34.329> it's<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.780> kind<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.379> like<00:02:35.620> clunky

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
time now it's a kind of like clunky

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.619 
time now it's a kind of like clunky
design<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.700> don't<00:02:36.940> know<00:02:37.060> I'm<00:02:37.209> sure<00:02:37.239> there's

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
design I don't know I'm sure there's

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.599 
design I don't know I'm sure there's
better<00:02:37.870> ones<00:02:38.049> out<00:02:38.319> there<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:39.489> know<00:02:39.579> I

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
better ones out there but you know I

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.039 
better ones out there but you know I
wanted<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.909> build<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:40.299> own<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.659> this<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.900> what

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
wanted to build my own and this is what

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.490 
wanted to build my own and this is what
I<00:02:41.079> came<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.379> with<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:42.209> will<00:02:43.209> eventually<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.989> mean

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
I came up with I will eventually I mean

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.410 
I came up with I will eventually I mean
this<00:02:44.620> literally<00:02:45.040> took<00:02:45.220> me<00:02:45.430> hours<00:02:45.579> for<00:02:46.269> some

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
this literally took me hours for some

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.800 
this literally took me hours for some
reason<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.909> then<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.180> took<00:02:49.329> me<00:02:49.450> even<00:02:49.659> more

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
reason and then it took me even more

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.930 
reason and then it took me even more
time<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.319> figure<00:02:50.590> out<00:02:50.769> why<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.099> was<00:02:51.519> not<00:02:51.670> being

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
time to figure out why it was not being

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.020 
time to figure out why it was not being
consistent<00:02:52.470> when<00:02:53.470> they<00:02:53.560> had<00:02:53.709> work<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.280> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
consistent when they had work and you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.780 
consistent when they had work and you
know<00:02:55.150> basically<00:02:55.389> a<00:02:55.690> workaround<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:57.459> yeah<00:02:57.609> let

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
know basically a workaround but yeah let

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.830 
know basically a workaround but yeah let
me<00:02:57.849> show<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.060> guys<00:02:58.120> how<00:02:58.329> to<00:02:58.359> build<00:02:58.569> this<00:02:58.780> thing

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
me show you guys how to build this thing

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.670 
me show you guys how to build this thing
um

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
um

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.729 
um
so<00:03:00.250> get<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> horizontal<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:01.389> I<00:03:01.720> don't<00:03:02.379> know<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
so get a horizontal it's I don't know I

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.890 
so get a horizontal it's I don't know I
don't<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:03.010> I'll<00:03:03.549> probably<00:03:03.760> look<00:03:04.030> up<00:03:04.269> online

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
don't know I'll probably look up online

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.020 
don't know I'll probably look up online
how<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.139> make<00:03:05.500> one<00:03:05.799> just<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.220> see<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:06.609> what<00:03:07.000> I

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
how to make one just to see like what I

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.080 
how to make one just to see like what I
could<00:03:07.359> have<00:03:07.480> done<00:03:07.659> wrong<00:03:07.959> potentially<00:03:09.090> but

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
could have done wrong potentially but

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.940 
could have done wrong potentially but
yeah<00:03:10.180> let<00:03:10.540> me<00:03:10.569> build<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:10.930> we're<00:03:11.560> gonna<00:03:11.620> start

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
yeah let me build this we're gonna start

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.009 
yeah let me build this we're gonna start
off<00:03:12.069> with<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.730> redstone<00:03:13.299> itself<00:03:13.720> we're<00:03:13.900> gonna

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
off with the redstone itself we're gonna

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.650 
off with the redstone itself we're gonna
put<00:03:14.290> one<00:03:14.319> here<00:03:14.829> I<00:03:15.040> had<00:03:15.160> one<00:03:15.400> tick<00:03:15.669> one<00:03:16.299> here<00:03:16.540> at

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
put one here I had one tick one here at

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.750 
put one here I had one tick one here at
three<00:03:16.930> ticks<00:03:17.230> another<00:03:17.919> one<00:03:18.099> at<00:03:18.250> three<00:03:18.459> ticks

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
three ticks another one at three ticks

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.390 
three ticks another one at three ticks
and<00:03:18.970> let<00:03:19.870> me<00:03:19.959> Vietnam<00:03:20.500> be<00:03:20.650> very<00:03:20.919> clear<00:03:21.220> when<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
and let me Vietnam be very clear when I

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.610 
and let me Vietnam be very clear when I
mean<00:03:21.699> like<00:03:21.910> do<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.389> exactly<00:03:23.109> as<00:03:23.230> I'm<00:03:23.410> doing

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
mean like do this exactly as I'm doing

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.830 
mean like do this exactly as I'm doing
it<00:03:23.889> otherwise<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.819> has<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:25.060> potential<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.690> not

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
it otherwise it has a potential to not

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.800 
it otherwise it has a potential to not
work<00:03:26.260> there's<00:03:26.709> one<00:03:26.889> on<00:03:27.040> two<00:03:27.280> ticks<00:03:27.579> this<00:03:28.569> one

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
work there's one on two ticks this one

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.629 
work there's one on two ticks this one
on<00:03:28.930> one<00:03:29.109> tick<00:03:29.379> let's<00:03:29.949> get<00:03:30.160> rid<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.340> anything

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
on one tick let's get rid of anything

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.869 
on one tick let's get rid of anything
extra<00:03:31.329> here<00:03:31.650> we're<00:03:32.650> gonna<00:03:32.799> put<00:03:33.069> redstone<00:03:33.370> line

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
extra here we're gonna put redstone line

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.110 
extra here we're gonna put redstone line
here<00:03:34.209> here<00:03:34.919> and<00:03:35.919> connecting<00:03:36.639> all<00:03:36.819> of<00:03:36.970> these

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
here here and connecting all of these

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.170 
here here and connecting all of these
ones<00:03:37.389> like<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.400> where<00:03:39.730> our<00:03:39.760> levers

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
ones like so this is where our levers

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.319 
ones like so this is where our levers
gonna<00:03:40.389> go<00:03:40.919> from<00:03:41.919> my<00:03:42.280> understanding<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:43.030> only

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
gonna go from my understanding this only

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.199 
gonna go from my understanding this only
works<00:03:43.720> with<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.959> lever<00:03:44.549> now<00:03:45.549> let's<00:03:45.970> try<00:03:46.180> a

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
works with a lever now let's try a

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.460 
works with a lever now let's try a
button<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:46.840> case<00:03:47.049> them<00:03:47.230> wrong

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.120 

oh<00:03:52.640> snap<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.970> works<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> button<00:03:54.690> sweet<00:03:55.440> all

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
oh snap it works with a button sweet all

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.370 
oh snap it works with a button sweet all
right<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.520> works<00:03:56.670> with<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.880> button<00:03:57.210> had<00:03:58.140> not

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
right it works with a button had not

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.620 
right it works with a button had not
tested<00:03:58.770> that<00:03:58.890> yet<00:03:58.950> all<00:03:59.550> right<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.180> now<00:04:00.330> at<00:04:00.480> this

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
tested that yet all right so now at this

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.970 
tested that yet all right so now at this
point<00:04:00.840> what<00:04:01.050> we're<00:04:01.200> gonna<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.740> this<00:04:01.920> is

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
point what we're gonna do is this is

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.340 
point what we're gonna do is this is
where<00:04:02.280> our<00:04:02.310> pistons<00:04:03.120> were<00:04:03.270> go<00:04:03.450> right<00:04:03.750> here<00:04:04.020> so

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
where our pistons were go right here so

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.960 
where our pistons were go right here so
we're<00:04:04.470> gonna<00:04:04.560> put<00:04:04.740> a<00:04:04.770> block<00:04:05.010> here<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.730> block

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
now that we're here place a block here

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.730 
now that we're here place a block here
and<00:04:57.180> let<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:57.510> finish<00:04:57.810> freaking<00:04:58.440> out<00:05:00.440> all<00:05:01.440> right

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
whatever block it's supposed to push

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.110 
whatever block it's supposed to push
like<00:05:07.500> so<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.100> hit<00:05:08.880> it

perfect now this should not matter if
it's<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.800> transparent<00:05:19.800> block<00:05:20.130> but<00:05:20.430> let's<00:05:20.640> try

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
it's a transparent block but let's try

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.440 
it's a transparent block but let's try
it<00:05:20.940> out

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.360 

yeah<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.600> redstone<00:05:28.020> is<00:05:28.170> not<00:05:28.350> based<00:05:28.800> around

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
yeah the redstone is not based around

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.280 
yeah the redstone is not based around
you<00:05:30.030> know<00:05:30.150> this<00:05:30.360> one<00:05:30.540> hitting<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.990> going

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
you know this one hitting and going

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.990 
you know this one hitting and going
through<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.680> back<00:05:31.860> like<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.400> one<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.640> had

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
through the back like that one I had

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.300 
through the back like that one I had
made<00:05:33.030> does<00:05:33.780> but<00:05:34.530> yeah<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.800> is<00:05:34.920> how<00:05:35.040> you<00:05:35.100> make

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
made does but yeah this is how you make

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.710 
made does but yeah this is how you make
a<00:05:35.490> horizontal<00:05:35.820> triple<00:05:36.630> piston<00:05:37.110> extender

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
a horizontal triple piston extender

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.820 
a horizontal triple piston extender
apparently<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.840> works<00:05:40.020> with<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.260> button<00:05:40.620> let's

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
apparently it works with a button let's

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.290 
apparently it works with a button let's
test<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.220> out<00:05:41.310> one<00:05:41.550> more<00:05:41.730> time<00:05:41.760> just<00:05:42.120> in<00:05:42.240> case

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
test it out one more time just in case

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.610 
test it out one more time just in case
that<00:05:42.600> was<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:42.750> freak<00:05:43.020> accident<00:05:43.170> of<00:05:43.650> some<00:05:43.680> kind
