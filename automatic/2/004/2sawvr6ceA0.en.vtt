within<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> eyes<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.650> how

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
within the eyes so think about how

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.080 
within the eyes so think about how
you're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> capture<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> photo<00:01:17.759> and

you're going to capture the photo and
that's<00:01:18.420> definitely<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.290> improve<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's definitely going to improve the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.260 
that's definitely going to improve the
final<00:01:20.790> look

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
final look

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.410 
final look

so<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> about<00:01:30.509> five<00:01:30.720> thousand<00:01:31.140> three<00:01:31.290> hundred

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so to about five thousand three hundred

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.260 
so to about five thousand three hundred
is<00:01:31.740> working<00:01:32.130> well<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.909> add

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
is working well for me and then just add

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
is working well for me and then just add
a<00:01:33.299> tiny<00:01:33.689> bit<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.020> magenta<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> tint

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
a tiny bit of magenta in the tint

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.310 
a tiny bit of magenta in the tint
now<00:01:35.850> these<00:01:36.030> settings<00:01:36.479> aren't<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> work

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
now these settings aren't going to work

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020 
now these settings aren't going to work
for<00:01:37.530> every<00:01:37.770> single<00:01:38.070> type<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> photo<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
for every single type of photo so you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
for every single type of photo so you
might<00:01:39.210> need<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.479> adjust<00:01:39.570> yours<00:01:40.079> accordingly

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
might need to adjust yours accordingly

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.340 
might need to adjust yours accordingly
however<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.420> use<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
however you know use these kind of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.899 
however you know use these kind of
techniques<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:43.979> applying<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
techniques that I'm applying to this and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
techniques that I'm applying to this and
apply<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.570> own<00:01:45.689> photos<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
apply it to your own photos and you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.980 
apply it to your own photos and you
should<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.189> okay<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.299> moving<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
should be right okay so moving down to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
should be right okay so moving down to
our<00:01:49.140> exposure<00:01:49.590> slider<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.189> I'm<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> do

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
our exposure slider what I'm going to do

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
our exposure slider what I'm going to do
is<00:01:50.820> purposely<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.570> expose<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> little

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
is purposely over expose this a little

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
is purposely over expose this a little
bit<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> 0.7<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.970> working<00:01:54.329> well

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
bit so about up to 0.7 is working well

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.209 
bit so about up to 0.7 is working well
for<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.750> photo<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.740> we're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.040> add

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
for this photo then we're going to add

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
for this photo then we're going to add
in<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> contrast<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.329> about<00:01:57.509> plus<00:01:57.780> 30<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
in a bit of contrast so about plus 30 to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.679 
in a bit of contrast so about plus 30 to
the<00:01:58.380> contrast<00:01:58.829> slider<00:01:59.119> okay<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.180> from<00:02:00.509> there

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the contrast slider okay so from there

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.850 
the contrast slider okay so from there
what<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.380> bring<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:01.680> our

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
what I'm going to do is bring down our

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.139 
what I'm going to do is bring down our
highlights<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> remove<00:02:02.759> some<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.060> these

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
highlights to remove some of these

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
highlights to remove some of these
highlights<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.780> his<00:02:03.869> face<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
highlights and his face and in the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.499 
highlights and his face and in the
background<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.670> about<00:02:05.820> negative<00:02:06.210> 30

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
background here to about negative 30

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240 
background here to about negative 30
then<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> bring<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.680> our

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
then we're going to bring down our

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.369 
then we're going to bring down our
shadows<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.879> about<00:02:09.060> negative<00:02:09.420> 25<00:02:09.840> our<00:02:10.110> whites

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
shadows to about negative 25 our whites

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.970 
shadows to about negative 25 our whites
and<00:02:10.739> our<00:02:11.340> blacks<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.910> all<00:02:12.120> about<00:02:12.390> negative<00:02:12.750> 25

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and our blacks to all about negative 25

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.770 
and our blacks to all about negative 25
so<00:02:14.159> it's<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.730> even<00:02:15.000> out<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> photo<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so it's going to even out the photo and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.440 
so it's going to even out the photo and
as<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.319> see<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> before<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.040> after<00:02:17.580> it's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
as you can see the before and after it's

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.839 
as you can see the before and after it's
all<00:02:18.720> starting<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> look<00:02:19.230> fairly<00:02:19.769> nice<00:02:20.069> now

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
all starting to look fairly nice now

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.580 
all starting to look fairly nice now
moving<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.420> clarity<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:22.110> clarity<00:02:22.470> you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
moving down to clarity with clarity you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.050 
moving down to clarity with clarity you
can<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:22.860> leave<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.159> as<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.489> or<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:23.879> can

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
can just leave it as it is or you can

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.990 
can just leave it as it is or you can
add<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> plus<00:02:24.450> or<00:02:24.720> minus<00:02:25.049> effect<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.790> zoom

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
add a plus or minus effect so if we zoom

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.869 
add a plus or minus effect so if we zoom
in<00:02:27.390> here<00:02:27.659> just<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:28.019> sec<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.549> bring<00:02:29.549> down<00:02:29.700> our

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
in here just a sec and bring down our

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.850 
in here just a sec and bring down our
clarity<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> negative<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.590> see<00:02:31.709> it's

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
clarity to a negative you can see it's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.559 
clarity to a negative you can see it's
just<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.220> making<00:02:32.640> everything<00:02:33.269> glow<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
just really making everything glow a

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.270 
just really making everything glow a
little<00:02:33.750> bit<00:02:34.049> more<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.500> creating<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> more<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
little bit more to creating a more of a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.250 
little bit more to creating a more of a
softer<00:02:35.700> look<00:02:35.879> however<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.569> we<00:02:36.750> bring<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.049> up<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
softer look however if we bring it up to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.410 
softer look however if we bring it up to
say<00:02:37.410> +10<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.879> enhance<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
say +10 it's just going to enhance the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.990 
say +10 it's just going to enhance the
details<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.049> his<00:02:40.170> face<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.489> it's<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
details on his face so it's really up to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.640 
details on his face so it's really up to
you<00:02:42.209> which<00:02:42.360> way<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.569> want<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> take<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.079> toil<00:02:43.379> as

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you which way you want to take a toil as

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.259 
you which way you want to take a toil as
I<00:02:43.829> said<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.459> leave<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.670> with

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
I said you can just leave it with

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.850 
I said you can just leave it with
nothing<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.019> me<00:02:46.110> personally<00:02:46.319> I'm<00:02:46.620> going

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
nothing but for me personally I'm going

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.580 
nothing but for me personally I'm going
to<00:02:46.950> drop<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> about<00:02:47.549> negative<00:02:48.000> 5<00:02:48.590> then

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
to drop it to about negative 5 then

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.900 
to drop it to about negative 5 then
moving<00:02:49.769> down<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.160> vibrance<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.670> saturation

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
moving down to vibrance and saturation

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.240 
moving down to vibrance and saturation
I'm<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.019> bring<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.290> our<00:02:52.500> vibrance<00:02:53.099> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
I'm going to bring up our vibrance to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.339 
I'm going to bring up our vibrance to
about<00:02:53.430> negative<00:02:53.790> 20<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.209> our<00:02:54.750> saturation

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
about negative 20 and our saturation

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.890 
about negative 20 and our saturation
down<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.709> about<00:02:55.859> negative<00:02:56.340> 15<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.599> zooming

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
down to about negative 15 so zooming

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.300 
down to about negative 15 so zooming
back<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.799> before<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
back out you can see the before and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.720 
back out you can see the before and
after<00:03:00.260> we've<00:03:01.260> almost<00:03:01.530> got<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.920> final<00:03:02.310> effect

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
after we've almost got the final effect

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
after we've almost got the final effect
so<00:03:03.390> moving<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:04.019> our<00:03:04.140> split<00:03:04.500> toning<00:03:04.739> I'm

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so moving down to our split toning I'm

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.130 
so moving down to our split toning I'm
going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.400> skip<00:03:06.180> tone<00:03:06.540> curve<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.959> hue

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
going to skip tone curve and hue

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.380 
going to skip tone curve and hue
saturation<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.859> luminance<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.549> what<00:03:09.299> I'm

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
saturation and luminance and what I'm

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.900 
saturation and luminance and what I'm
going<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.660> do<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.170> change<00:03:10.829> our<00:03:11.069> hue<00:03:11.430> belyeu<00:03:11.790> in

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
going to do is change our hue belyeu in

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.699 
going to do is change our hue belyeu in
our<00:03:12.030> highlights<00:03:12.420> for<00:03:12.599> about<00:03:12.750> 65<00:03:13.349> our

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
our highlights for about 65 our

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.699 
our highlights for about 65 our
saturation<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.519> 15<00:03:14.940> our<00:03:15.299> balance<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.319> negative

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
saturation to 15 our balance to negative

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.210 
saturation to 15 our balance to negative
20

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
20

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.400 
20
our<00:03:17.760> hue<00:03:18.120> value<00:03:18.419> in<00:03:18.569> our<00:03:18.720> shadows<00:03:19.079> for<00:03:19.260> about

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
our hue value in our shadows for about

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.280 
our hue value in our shadows for about
50<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.099> our<00:03:20.250> saturation<00:03:20.669> to<00:03:20.940> 5<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:22.079> that's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
50 and our saturation to 5 so that's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.870 
50 and our saturation to 5 so that's
going<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.829> just<00:03:23.010> apply<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> nice<00:03:23.579> warm

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
going to do is just apply a nice warm

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.759 
going to do is just apply a nice warm
tone<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.389> overall<00:03:24.810> image<00:03:25.169> apply<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.650> to

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
tone to the overall image apply it to

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.140 
tone to the overall image apply it to
the<00:03:25.859> highlights<00:03:26.220> as<00:03:26.370> well<00:03:26.549> as<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.790> shadows

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the highlights as well as the shadows

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.509 
the highlights as well as the shadows
and<00:03:27.389> those<00:03:28.290> values<00:03:28.709> there<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.160> pretty<00:03:29.340> much

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
and those values there are pretty much

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.370 
and those values there are pretty much
universal<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.239> should<00:03:30.389> work<00:03:30.569> on<00:03:30.780> any<00:03:30.989> type<00:03:31.230> of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
universal and should work on any type of

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.740 
universal and should work on any type of
photo<00:03:31.590> ok<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.370> after<00:03:32.819> you've<00:03:33.120> done<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.450> just

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
photo ok so after you've done that just

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.240 
photo ok so after you've done that just
take<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> closer<00:03:34.290> look<00:03:34.410> at<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:34.680> photo<00:03:34.919> make

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
take a closer look at your photo make

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.039 
take a closer look at your photo make
sure<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.209> not<00:03:36.419> affecting<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.870> skin

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
sure that it's not affecting the skin

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.990 
sure that it's not affecting the skin
tone<00:03:37.380> too<00:03:37.530> too<00:03:37.650> much<00:03:37.859> like<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.579> my<00:03:38.730> case

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
tone too too much like it is in my case

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000 
tone too too much like it is in my case
I<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.349> starts<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> look<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.859> bit

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
I think and if it starts to look a bit

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.379 
I think and if it starts to look a bit
too<00:03:41.160> warm<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:41.609> go<00:03:41.760> ahead<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.060> bring<00:03:42.180> down

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
too warm you can go ahead and bring down

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.479 
too warm you can go ahead and bring down
your<00:03:42.599> temperature<00:03:42.989> slider<00:03:43.260> back<00:03:43.590> towards<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
your temperature slider back towards the

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.190 
your temperature slider back towards the
blue<00:03:44.669> side<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> little<00:03:45.150> bit<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.540> that's

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
blue side a little bit and that's

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.319 
blue side a little bit and that's
looking<00:03:46.440> pretty<00:03:46.680> good<00:03:46.829> right<00:03:46.889> there<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:48.209> one

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
looking pretty good right there so one

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.030 
looking pretty good right there so one
last<00:03:48.480> thing<00:03:48.660> quickly<00:03:48.989> before<00:03:49.410> we<00:03:49.530> finish<00:03:49.859> up

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
last thing quickly before we finish up

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.949 
last thing quickly before we finish up
if<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.340> zoom<00:03:50.609> in<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.970> his<00:03:51.180> teeth<00:03:51.450> here<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.810> can

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
if we zoom in on his teeth here you can

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.569 
if we zoom in on his teeth here you can
see<00:03:52.109> with<00:03:52.290> all<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.680> warm<00:03:52.889> adjustments<00:03:53.430> and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
see with all the warm adjustments and

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.759 
see with all the warm adjustments and
the<00:03:53.639> split<00:03:53.880> toning<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> chance<00:03:55.620> it

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
the split toning there is a chance it

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.289 
the split toning there is a chance it
can<00:03:55.919> affect<00:03:56.250> their<00:03:56.400> teeth<00:03:56.609> as<00:03:56.849> well<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
can affect their teeth as well as the

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.180 
can affect their teeth as well as the
wipes<00:03:57.480> within<00:03:57.840> their<00:03:58.019> eyes<00:03:58.200> now<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.129> to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
wipes within their eyes now you want to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.830 
wipes within their eyes now you want to
make<00:03:59.310> sure<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.150> don't<00:04:00.329> make<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.540> too

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
make sure that you don't make it too

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.330 
make sure that you don't make it too
warm<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.410> their<00:04:01.560> teeth<00:04:01.769> are<00:04:01.889> starting<00:04:02.099> to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
warm that their teeth are starting to

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.680 
warm that their teeth are starting to
look<00:04:02.400> yellow<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.120> their<00:04:03.269> eyes<00:04:03.389> are<00:04:03.419> starting

look yellow and their eyes are starting

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.210 
look yellow and their eyes are starting
to<00:04:03.930> look<00:04:04.019> yellow<00:04:04.260> because<00:04:04.620> obviously<00:04:04.859> that's

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
to look yellow because obviously that's

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.030 
to look yellow because obviously that's
going<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.639> look<00:04:05.790> ridiculous<00:04:06.319> if<00:04:07.319> you<00:04:07.650> do<00:04:07.829> get

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
going to look ridiculous if you do get

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.229 
going to look ridiculous if you do get
to<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.160> point<00:04:08.280> where<00:04:08.609> their<00:04:08.760> teeth<00:04:09.000> are

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
to the point where their teeth are

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.390 
to the point where their teeth are
starting<00:04:09.419> to<00:04:09.690> look<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.870> tiny<00:04:10.019> bit<00:04:10.290> yellow<00:04:10.590> again

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
starting to look a tiny bit yellow again

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.770 
starting to look a tiny bit yellow again
you<00:04:11.579> can<00:04:11.699> either<00:04:11.910> bring<00:04:12.180> back<00:04:12.389> a<00:04:12.419> bit<00:04:12.660> more

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
you can either bring back a bit more

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.720 
you can either bring back a bit more
