going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> spawn<00:00:41.190> at<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.910> top<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> stairs

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
going to spawn at the top of the stairs

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.799 
going to spawn at the top of the stairs
you'll<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.410> spawn<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
you'll get them when they spawn and

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.209 
you'll get them when they spawn and
these<00:00:45.809> aren't<00:00:46.079> blocked<00:00:46.500> by<00:00:46.710> line<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.039> sight

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
these aren't blocked by line of sight

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.799 
these aren't blocked by line of sight
and<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.520> also<00:00:47.640> jump<00:00:47.940> over<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> chains<00:00:48.600> as

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and you can also jump over the chains as

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.170 
and you can also jump over the chains as
well<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.680> does<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.070> look<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.940> get

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
well so it does take a look you can get

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
well so it does take a look you can get
caught<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> chains<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.320> jump

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
caught on the chains if you don't jump

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
caught on the chains if you don't jump
properly<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.309> jump<00:00:53.579> over<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
properly but you can jump over the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
properly but you can jump over the
chains<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> jump<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.570> down<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.680> know

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
chains and jump back down so you know

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
chains and jump back down so you know
there<00:00:56.940> might<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.120> some<00:00:57.420> form<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> tactic<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there might be some form of tactic that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.540 
there might be some form of tactic that
you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> main<00:00:59.370> two

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you can do with that but the main two

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
you can do with that but the main two
pillars<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> middle<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.390> imagina<00:01:00.989> where

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
pillars in the middle at imagina where

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.479 
pillars in the middle at imagina where
things<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:01.890> place<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.399> know

really<00:01:45.149> nice-looking<00:01:45.390> arena<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.880> overall<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
really nice-looking arena so overall I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.429 
really nice-looking arena so overall I
don't<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:48.509> anything<00:01:48.689> real<00:01:49.110> wrong

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
don't think there's anything real wrong

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
don't think there's anything real wrong
with<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.770> arena<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.729> seem<00:01:50.970> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
with this arena you know you seem that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.399 
with this arena you know you seem that
the<00:01:51.270> priest<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.960> stuck<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the priest got a little bit stuck on the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
the priest got a little bit stuck on the
chains<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> couldn't<00:01:53.070> quite<00:01:53.250> jump<00:01:53.579> over<00:01:53.909> them

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
