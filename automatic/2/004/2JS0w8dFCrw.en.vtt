00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.930
 an old lady was one day at the bank of the 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.790
 trade bancomer carrying a bag 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.309
 filled to the brim with money in 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.500
 cash he insisted to the banker that 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.509
 I wanted to speak exclusively with 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.820
 the president of the bank to open a 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.680
 savings account I need to talk to the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.119
 president of the bank because I'm 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 investing a lot of money in this 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.920
 institution after much discussing the 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.140
 They brought before the bank president 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.679
 respecting the concept that the client 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 is always right, good afternoon 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.120
 lady could you tell me what is the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.150

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.910
 millions of american dollars 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.130
 the president naturally felt a 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.260
 great curiosity to know where he had 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.350
 The old lady took out so much money and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.930
 asked mrs. 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.660
 so much money I get if it's not too much 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.850
 indiscretion of where I get so much money 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.900
 It's very simple, I make money 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.739
 placing bets 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.810
 bets what kind of bets good all

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.860
 balls are square that is a bet 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 very stupid you can never win a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.750
 bet of that good guy and I told him that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.080

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.510
 American dollars that my balls do not 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.430
 they are square in agreement but as there 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.140
 a lot of money in between I can come 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 tomorrow at 10 in the morning with my 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.020
 lawyer to serve as our witness 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.790
 of course the president answered 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.720
 considering that you bet a lot 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.550
 money 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.340
 that night the president was very 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.350
 nervous because of the bet long step 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 time looking at his balls in the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.200
 mirror walked from one side to another a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.090
 and again a rigorous examination and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.250
 he was absolutely convinced that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.890
 his balls were not square and that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 I would win the bet the next morning 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.690
 at ten o'clock the old lady 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 He appeared with his lawyer in the office 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.319
 of the president 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.110
 the old woman repeated the agreed bet 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.420
 of 250 thousand American dollars to which the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.330
 President's balls were square 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.700
 in front of the lawyer the president accepted 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.709
 again the bet and the old lady 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.060
 asked that he pull down his pants to 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.060
 to show his balls 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.380
 the president pulled down his pants and 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.360
 the old woman came and looked at his balls 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.780
 carefully and asked timidly 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.510
 if he could play them well he said 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.610
 the president convinced that 250 thousand 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.410
 American dollars was a lot of money and 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.810
 he understood that she wanted to be 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.090
 absolutely sure the old lady is 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.820
 approached the president and began to feel 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.530
 your balls gently meanwhile the 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.440
 President realized that the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.470
 lawyer was hitting his head and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.090
 Now what happens to his lawyer anything alone 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.070
 that I've bet with him a million 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.870
 American dollars to today at 10 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.400
 the morning I would have the balls of 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.400
 president of the bank in my hands 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.060
