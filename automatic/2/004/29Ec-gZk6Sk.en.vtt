works<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.979> very<00:01:59.039> well<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.749> just<00:02:00.780> play

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
works out very well so you just play

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.140 
works out very well so you just play
video

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.240 

so<00:02:07.150> we<00:02:07.270> can<00:02:07.450> maximize<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.530> there<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.130> can

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so we can maximize that there so you can

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.630 
so we can maximize that there so you can
see<00:02:09.430> how<00:02:09.460> how<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.360> video<00:02:10.869> looks<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
see how how the video looks on this and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.950 
see how how the video looks on this and
we<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:12.970> zoom<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.540> little<00:02:13.660> bit<00:02:13.780> closer<00:02:14.080> there

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.930 

so<00:02:22.960> get<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> good<00:02:23.860> idea<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.280> hydrogen

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
so get a good idea of hydrogen

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.330 
so get a good idea of hydrogen
comparisons<00:02:25.810> 14<00:02:26.230> inches<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.590> also<00:02:26.860> 42<00:02:27.160> inch

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
comparisons 14 inches is also 42 inch

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
comparisons 14 inches is also 42 inch
laptop<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.510> me<00:02:28.600> it's<00:02:28.750> about<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.020> same

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
laptop so for me it's about the same

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.630 
laptop so for me it's about the same
range<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.740> course<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.250> height<00:02:30.460> of<00:02:30.490> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
range of course just the height of the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.780 
range of course just the height of the
laptop<00:02:31.030> makes<00:02:31.210> difference<00:02:31.630> there<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.560> i<00:02:32.980> like

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
laptop makes difference there but i like

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.970 
laptop makes difference there but i like
it<00:02:33.850> solid<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.780> retail<00:02:35.230> i<00:02:35.440> think<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.710> can<00:02:35.830> get

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
it solid the retail i think you can get

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.690 
it solid the retail i think you can get
it<00:02:36.070> for<00:02:36.220> about<00:02:37.410> 11<00:02:38.410> 40<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> market<00:02:39.670> right

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it for about 11 40 on the market right

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.360 
it for about 11 40 on the market right
there<00:02:40.090> right<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.530> downslide<00:02:41.980> tutors

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
there right now the the downslide tutors

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.580 
there right now the the downslide tutors
of<00:02:42.550> course<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.850> takes<00:02:42.970> two<00:02:43.300> USB<00:02:43.990> ports<00:02:44.020> so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
of course it takes two USB ports so

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.470 
of course it takes two USB ports so
that's<00:02:44.770> pretty<00:02:45.100> much<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> only<00:02:45.580> downer<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.209> see

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
that's pretty much the only downer I see

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
that's pretty much the only downer I see
there<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.380> know<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:47.680> cool<00:02:47.890> because<00:02:47.980> you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
there but you know it's cool because you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.150 
there but you know it's cool because you
can<00:02:48.160> set<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.550> up<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.240> either<00:02:49.420> side<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
can set it up but it either side but you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.440 
can set it up but it either side but you
know<00:02:51.280> since<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.700> transfer<00:02:52.060> anything<00:02:52.240> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
know since you transfer anything to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.790 
know since you transfer anything to
write<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.020> it's<00:02:53.170> best<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.440> put<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.680> right

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
write so it's best to put in the right

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.430 
write so it's best to put in the right
side<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.430> thing<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.790> very<00:02:54.880> light<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> like

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
side this thing is very light so I like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.830 
side this thing is very light so I like
about<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.250> drop<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.630> see

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840

you know yep it's very useful I like it

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.390 
you know yep it's very useful I like it
a<00:03:39.580> lot<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.959> pretty<00:03:41.860> cool<00:03:42.130> if

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
a lot I think this is a pretty cool if

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.759 
a lot I think this is a pretty cool if
you're<00:03:42.760> always<00:03:43.120> on<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.360> road<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:44.200> me<00:03:44.440> you

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
you're always on the road like me you

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.039 
you're always on the road like me you
know<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.280> makes<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.850> works<00:03:46.030> out<00:03:46.180> very<00:03:46.239> well<00:03:46.540> you

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
know it makes it works out very well you

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.410 
know it makes it works out very well you
can<00:03:47.230> actually<00:03:47.380> use<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:49.060> do<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> lot<00:03:49.360> of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
can actually use this to do a lot of

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.690 
can actually use this to do a lot of
work<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.870> multitasking<00:03:50.709> sprightly<00:03:51.549> work

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
work and multitasking sprightly work

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.530 
work and multitasking sprightly work
pretty<00:03:51.940> well<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:53.380> downside<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.670> uses<00:03:54.940> two<00:03:55.090> USB

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
pretty well the downside it uses two USB

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.120 
pretty well the downside it uses two USB
ports<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:55.900> that's<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.260> big<00:03:56.500> downer<00:03:56.769> here

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
ports so that's the big downer here

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.289 
ports so that's the big downer here
that's<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.400> part<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.820> probably<00:03:58.030> be<00:03:58.269> very

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
that's the part I probably be very

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.539 
that's the part I probably be very
annoying<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.810> most<00:03:59.080> people<00:03:59.440> on<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.799> I<00:04:00.070> say

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
annoying to most people on that I say

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.479 
annoying to most people on that I say
it's<00:04:00.640> pretty<00:04:00.820> cool<00:04:01.170> retails<00:04:02.170> for<00:04:02.230> about<00:04:02.650> 140
