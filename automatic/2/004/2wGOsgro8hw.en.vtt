00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
okay here we have an RCA XL 100 TV

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:18.500 
okay here we have an RCA XL 100 TV
it's<00:00:12.290> transitional<00:00:13.290> not<00:00:13.679> transistorized<00:00:14.309> TV

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.040 

I'm<00:00:18.960> too<00:00:19.170> much<00:00:19.320> transistorized<00:00:20.010> yes

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
I'm too much transistorized yes

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.510 
I'm too much transistorized yes

and a whole bunch of TV a cigar see you

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.650 
and a whole bunch of TV a cigar see you
guys<00:00:54.730> have<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.120> best<00:00:55.300> fish<00:00:55.510> through<00:00:55.809> tubes

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
guys have the best fish through tubes

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.070 
guys have the best fish through tubes
back<00:00:57.230> then<00:00:57.440> our<00:00:57.650> see<00:00:57.860> a<00:00:58.570> very<00:00:59.570> very<00:00:59.870> good

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
back then our see a very very good

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:40.289 
back then our see a very very good
hydrology<00:01:00.920> TVs<00:01:01.250> in<00:01:01.460> five<00:01:01.970> four<00:01:02.210> stratified

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
around our area is kind of like

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.510 
around our area is kind of like
satellite<00:02:09.090> land<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.130> people<00:02:11.310> are

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
satellite land not a lot of people are

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.839 
satellite land not a lot of people are
fond<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.940> old<00:02:12.239> TVs<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.959> as<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.319> know<00:02:13.849> 2009

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
fond of old TVs and as you know 2009

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.150 
fond of old TVs and as you know 2009
February<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.750> 2009<00:02:16.290> everything<00:02:16.739> was<00:02:16.860> going

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
February of 2009 everything was going

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the other ones corresponding I will not

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:17.450 
the other ones corresponding I will not
discontinue<00:03:07.000> my<00:03:07.120> search<00:03:07.330> program<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.990> I

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.580 

engrams<00:03:18.460> are<00:03:18.700> seabirds

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
engrams are seabirds

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.229 
engrams are seabirds
and<00:03:20.680> very<00:03:20.890> tough<00:03:21.250> words<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.880> for<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.210 

very<00:03:58.750> very<00:03:59.020> nice<00:03:59.319> very<00:04:00.000> mated<00:04:01.019> 619<00:04:02.019> was<00:04:03.010> made

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
very very nice very mated 619 was made

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.280 
very very nice very mated 619 was made
in<00:04:03.569> 1968

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
in 1968

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.640 
in 1968
I<00:04:05.349> believe<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.819> was<00:04:06.939> made<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.269> 1968<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.319> took<00:04:08.500> off

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
I believe it was made in 1968 I took off

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.849 
I believe it was made in 1968 I took off
the<00:04:08.799> tracks<00:04:09.069> is<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:10.120> back<00:04:10.269> of<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.480> chassis

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.029 

got<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.609> radiation<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.689> then<00:04:18.900> what's<00:04:19.769> cool<00:04:20.009> is

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
got to radiation and then what's cool is

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.490 
got to radiation and then what's cool is
RCA<00:04:20.639> helps<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.599> guess<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.930> service<00:04:22.319> technician

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
RCA helps I guess the service technician

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.820 
RCA helps I guess the service technician
a<00:04:22.949> lot<00:04:23.360> put<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.419> lot<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.689> tips<00:04:24.930> here<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.379> do<00:04:25.469> test

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
a lot put a lot of tips here you do test

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.700 
a lot put a lot of tips here you do test
achievement<00:04:26.270> here<00:04:27.270> which<00:04:27.750> which<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.289> cannot

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
achievement here which which you cannot

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.890 
achievement here which which you cannot
find<00:04:29.039> in<00:04:29.219> TVs<00:04:29.550> today<00:04:29.819> which<00:04:29.969> is<00:04:30.000> very<00:04:30.120> cool

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
find in TVs today which is very cool
