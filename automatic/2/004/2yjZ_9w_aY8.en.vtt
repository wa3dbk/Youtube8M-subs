00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.850 
two reasons weren't good enough for you
as<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> stand<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.270> third<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:04.200> pretty<00:03:04.620> much

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
as a stand this third one is pretty much

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.740 
as a stand this third one is pretty much
one<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> biggest<00:03:05.520> reasons<00:03:06.000> he<00:03:06.270> is<00:03:06.450> your

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
one of the biggest reasons he is your

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.230 
one of the biggest reasons he is your
spawn<00:03:07.200> point<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.280> very<00:03:08.730> important

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
spawn point now this is very important

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.900 
spawn point now this is very important
especially<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.930> no<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.890> jet<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> game<00:03:11.550> modes

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
especially and no a jet the game modes

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.400 
especially and no a jet the game modes
like<00:03:11.970> combat<00:03:12.390> mission<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.840> set<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.050> control

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
like combat mission and set the control

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.540 
like combat mission and set the control
because<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> always<00:03:13.800> want<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.160> spawn<00:03:14.400> in

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
because you always want to spawn in

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.460 
because you always want to spawn in
right<00:03:15.060> next<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> action<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.110> don't<00:03:16.290> want

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
right next to the action you don't want

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.380 
right next to the action you don't want
to<00:03:16.560> spot<00:03:16.830> always<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.640> furnace<00:03:18.000> back<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
to spot always the furnace back in the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.260 
to spot always the furnace back in the
mat<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.900> keeping<00:03:19.800> your<00:03:19.920> spawn<00:03:20.280> point<00:03:20.580> alive<00:03:20.910> is

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
mat so keeping your spawn point alive is

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.699 
mat so keeping your spawn point alive is
really<00:03:21.720> good<00:03:21.930> because<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.350> you're<00:03:22.500> not

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
really good because if you're not

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.470 
really good because if you're not
working<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.190> him<00:03:23.340> he's<00:03:23.850> pretty<00:03:24.120> much<00:03:24.270> gonna

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
working with him he's pretty much gonna

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.080 
working with him he's pretty much gonna
die<00:03:24.810> pretty<00:03:25.230> much<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.410> lot<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.890> time<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.400> you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
die pretty much a lot of time and you

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.790
