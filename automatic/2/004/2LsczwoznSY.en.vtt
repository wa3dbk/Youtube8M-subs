would normally be flashing my

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.350 
would normally be flashing my
temperature<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:06.490> alternates<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
temperature and it alternates the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.890 
reason my fans not kicking on um other
side<00:03:21.209> my<00:03:22.209> bad

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.110 

my<00:03:26.620> fan<00:03:29.730> isn't<00:03:30.730> engaging<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.980> thought<00:03:32.980> maybe<00:03:33.459> it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
my fan isn't engaging I thought maybe it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.589 
my fan isn't engaging I thought maybe it
froze<00:03:34.540> up<00:03:34.900> or<00:03:35.760> something<00:03:36.760> got<00:03:36.879> caught<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.450> it

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
froze up or something got caught in it

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.339 
froze up or something got caught in it
or<00:03:38.849> connector<00:03:39.849> came<00:03:40.090> loose<00:03:40.330> something<00:03:41.230> like

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
or connector came loose something like

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.350 
or connector came loose something like
that<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.590> checked<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.159> that<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:42.610> my<00:03:42.760> wires<00:03:43.030> are

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
that I checked on that all my wires are

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.979 
that I checked on that all my wires are
good<00:03:43.629> my<00:03:43.989> connections<00:03:44.560> are<00:03:44.769> good<00:03:45.540> fan<00:03:46.540> spins

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
good my connections are good fan spins

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.830 
good my connections are good fan spins
freely<00:03:47.670> know<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.209> see<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.480> or<00:03:49.569> not<00:03:49.690> of

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
freely know if you can see it or not of

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.420 
freely know if you can see it or not of
it<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:52.480> spins<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.560> nothing<00:03:56.920> with<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.190> fan

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
it it spins so it's nothing with the fan

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.150 
it it spins so it's nothing with the fan
evidently<00:03:58.239> it's<00:03:58.859> something<00:03:59.859> on<00:03:59.950> the<00:03:59.980> other

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
evidently it's something on the other

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
evidently it's something on the other
end<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:04.590> have<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.829> jump<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:09.150> try<00:04:10.150> to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
end so I have to jump that and try to

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.009 
end so I have to jump that and try to
