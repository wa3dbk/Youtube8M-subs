00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.329 

okay<00:00:02.190> so<00:00:02.250> now<00:00:02.760> on<00:00:02.939> two<00:00:03.060> keys<00:00:03.950> the<00:00:04.950> way<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.160> make

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
okay so now on two keys the way you make

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.400 
okay so now on two keys the way you make
keys<00:00:05.700> really<00:00:06.509> simple<00:00:07.189> take<00:00:08.189> your<00:00:08.370> clay<00:00:09.410> not

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
keys really simple take your clay not

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.180 
keys really simple take your clay not
quite<00:00:10.679> as<00:00:10.920> thick<00:00:11.280> maybe<00:00:11.849> half<00:00:12.179> an<00:00:12.330> inch<00:00:12.889> if<00:00:13.889> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
quite as thick maybe half an inch if you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.980 
quite as thick maybe half an inch if you
have<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> clay<00:00:14.610> board<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.570> helps<00:00:15.719> out<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> lot

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
have a clay board that helps out a lot

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
have a clay board that helps out a lot
so<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> thin<00:00:19.590> sheet<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> clay<00:00:32.329> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so now I have a thin sheet of clay and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.620 
so now I have a thin sheet of clay and
I'm<00:00:33.420> only<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.780> make<00:00:33.899> three<00:00:34.290> keys<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'm only going to make three keys so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
I'm only going to make three keys so
we're<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> cut<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> strip<00:00:38.000> at<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> 90

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
we're going to cut a strip at a 90

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
we're going to cut a strip at a 90
degree<00:00:39.780> angle<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.610> about<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
degree angle and the other one about a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.330 
degree angle and the other one about a
45<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> 45

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
45 so you can see that I have a 45

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.939 
45 so you can see that I have a 45
degree<00:00:53.460> angle<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.059> side<00:00:54.559> 90<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> back

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
degree angle on one side 90 on the back

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
degree angle on one side 90 on the back
90<00:00:56.820> isn't<00:00:57.030> important<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
90 isn't important because it can be the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
90 isn't important because it can be the
outside<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.379> mold<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.550> again<00:01:00.090> I'm

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
outside of your mold but so again I'm

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
outside of your mold but so again I'm
going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.539> another<00:01:00.690> 45<00:01:01.230> degree<00:01:01.500> angle<00:01:01.710> cut

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
going to do another 45 degree angle cut

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.070 
going to do another 45 degree angle cut
a<00:01:02.480> 45<00:01:03.480> degree<00:01:03.840> angle<00:01:04.199> cut<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.510> that<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> key

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
a 45 degree angle cut and that is a key

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640 
a 45 degree angle cut and that is a key
that's<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> key<00:01:07.920> looks<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.430> clay<00:01:09.650> so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that's what a key looks like in clay so

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 
that's what a key looks like in clay so
it's<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.130> deeper<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.000> needs<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> be

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it's a lot deeper than it needs to be

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.679 
it's a lot deeper than it needs to be
you'll<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.320> why<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> press<00:01:15.479> this

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you'll see why I'm going to press this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
you'll see why I'm going to press this
really<00:01:16.200> close<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> edge<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
really close to the edge of the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
really close to the edge of the
sculpture<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.140> then<00:01:19.140> cut<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> flush<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> my

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sculpture and then cut it flush to my

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.440 
sculpture and then cut it flush to my
wall<00:01:20.900> look<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.140> teeny<00:01:22.560> tiny<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.070> key

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
wall look at this teeny tiny little key

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.090 
wall look at this teeny tiny little key
that<00:01:24.450> keeps<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.530> three<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.830> these<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.009> going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that keeps the three of these are going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.499 
that keeps the three of these are going
to<00:01:26.159> keep<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.400> mold<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:26.820> shifting<00:01:27.060> against

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to keep my mold from shifting against

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260 
to keep my mold from shifting against
itself<00:01:27.780> when<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.880> no<00:01:29.880> longer<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
itself when it's no longer get a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
itself when it's no longer get a
sculpture<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:30.990> trying<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> cast<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
sculpture in it you're trying to cast it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.389 
sculpture in it you're trying to cast it
up<00:01:32.240> clean<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.720> bit

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.090 

the<00:01:40.060> reason<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.509> cut<00:01:40.960> those<00:01:41.140> edges<00:01:41.469> at<00:01:41.619> an

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the reason you cut those edges at an

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.419 
the reason you cut those edges at an
angle<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:44.409> angle<00:01:44.859> make<00:01:45.219> sure

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
angle is because that angle make sure

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.490 
angle is because that angle make sure
that<00:01:45.579> these<00:01:45.759> mold<00:01:46.659> walls<00:01:46.929> don't<00:01:47.140> walk<00:01:47.289> into

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
that these mold walls don't walk into

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.389 
that these mold walls don't walk into
themselves<00:01:48.039> if<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.509> did<00:01:49.689> square<00:01:50.109> Keys

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
themselves if you did square Keys

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.779 
themselves if you did square Keys
they're<00:01:51.399> probably<00:01:51.579> going<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.850> break<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.640> can

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
they're probably going to break you can

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.669 
they're probably going to break you can
do<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> few<00:01:55.509> depends<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.350> size<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.649> your

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
do a few depends on the size of your

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.990 
do a few depends on the size of your
sculpture<00:01:57.130> I'm<00:01:57.250> doing<00:01:57.490> three<00:01:58.619> top<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.880> two

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
sculpture I'm doing three top in the two

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.070 
sculpture I'm doing three top in the two
sides

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.010 

so<00:02:07.650> I<00:02:07.680> said<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> 45<00:02:09.240> degree<00:02:09.420> angle<00:02:09.570> don't

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
so I said about a 45 degree angle don't

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.190 
so I said about a 45 degree angle don't
worry<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.740> not<00:02:10.890> exact<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.960> don't<00:02:13.110> have

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
worry if it's not exact you don't have

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.160 
worry if it's not exact you don't have
to<00:02:13.320> sit<00:02:13.470> there<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.630> calculate<00:02:15.630> or<00:02:15.750> measure<00:02:15.780> it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
to sit there and calculate or measure it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.170 
to sit there and calculate or measure it
somehow<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:17.280> eyeball<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:23.180> looks

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
somehow just just eyeball it it looks

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.610 
somehow just just eyeball it it looks
really<00:02:24.240> small<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.200> thing<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.470> going<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
really small but this thing is going to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.100 
really small but this thing is going to
be<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:25.890> important<00:02:29.900> okay

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
be so important okay

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.150 
be so important okay
my<00:02:31.890> final<00:02:32.190> key<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:32.940> top<00:02:34.160> this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
my final key is going to go on top this

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.530 
my final key is going to go on top this
one<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.580> make<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> little<00:02:35.970> wider<00:02:36.240> actually

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
one I can make a little wider actually

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.300 
one I can make a little wider actually
so<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.570> made<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.870> wider<00:02:40.320> key<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.980> will<00:02:41.130> still

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
so I made it a wider key it will still

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.080 
so I made it a wider key it will still
be<00:02:41.460> really<00:02:41.880> shallow<00:02:45.260> okay<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.880> going

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
be really shallow okay so that is going

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:04.260 
be really shallow okay so that is going
to<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.240> right<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.690> top

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:13.960 

okay<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.330> that's<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.780> end<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.959> our<00:03:06.080> clay<00:03:12.970> using

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
okay so that's the end of our clay using

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.040 
okay so that's the end of our clay using
the<00:03:14.060> same<00:03:14.239> sponge<00:03:14.510> cleaning<00:03:15.110> up<00:03:15.200> these<00:03:17.050> edges

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
the same sponge cleaning up these edges

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:26.170 
the same sponge cleaning up these edges
of<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.410> key<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> little<00:03:18.769> bit<00:03:24.700> now<00:03:25.700> thinking

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
of this key a little bit now thinking

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.729 
of this key a little bit now thinking
ahead<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.480> little<00:03:26.720> bit<00:03:26.870> what<00:03:27.319> I'm<00:03:27.410> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.590> do

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
ahead a little bit what I'm going to do

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.410 
ahead a little bit what I'm going to do
is<00:03:27.950> eventually<00:03:28.370> when<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.549> mold<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.940> taken<00:03:29.239> off

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
is eventually when the mold is taken off

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.780 
is eventually when the mold is taken off
I'm<00:03:30.140> going<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.620> then<00:03:30.769> place<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.430> inside<00:03:31.580> a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
I'm going to then place it inside a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.430 
I'm going to then place it inside a
bucket<00:03:32.150> upside<00:03:32.510> down<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.110> that's<00:03:33.230> how<00:03:33.350> I'm

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
bucket upside down and that's how I'm

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960 
bucket upside down and that's how I'm
going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.650> fill<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:33.920> up<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:34.790> have<00:03:34.880> a

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
going to fill it up you don't have a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.490 
going to fill it up you don't have a
bucket<00:03:35.390> what<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.630> can<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.170> can<00:03:36.319> build

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
bucket what you can do is you can build

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.589 
bucket what you can do is you can build
the<00:03:36.739> top<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.130> your<00:03:37.250> wall<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.519> little<00:03:38.030> higher<00:03:38.269> and

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
the top of your wall a little higher and

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.530 
the top of your wall a little higher and
then<00:03:39.260> cut<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.530> completely<00:03:39.739> flat<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.330> you

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
then cut it completely flat so that you

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.570 
then cut it completely flat so that you
still<00:03:41.750> give<00:03:41.900> yourself<00:03:42.260> an<00:03:42.380> inch<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> top

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
still give yourself an inch but the top

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.699 
still give yourself an inch but the top
of<00:03:43.730> your<00:03:43.880> mold<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.269> flat<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.260> what<00:03:45.380> that<00:03:45.530> does

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
of your mold is flat and what that does

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.949 
of your mold is flat and what that does
is<00:03:45.920> you're<00:03:46.099> basically<00:03:47.090> preparing<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.780> then

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
is you're basically preparing to then

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.720 
is you're basically preparing to then
when<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.500> mold<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.860> open<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.340> cleaned<00:03:49.549> up

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
when the mold is open and cleaned up

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.130 
when the mold is open and cleaned up
you'll<00:03:50.090> flip<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.480> upside<00:03:50.720> down<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:50.959> have<00:03:51.080> a

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
you'll flip it upside down you have a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.530 
you'll flip it upside down you have a
flat<00:03:51.440> edge<00:03:51.640> -<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:53.150> rest<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.569> on<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:55.450> lot<00:03:56.450> of

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
flat edge - to rest it on a lot of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.940 
flat edge - to rest it on a lot of
old-school<00:03:56.840> mold<00:03:57.110> makers<00:03:57.380> can<00:03:57.560> sometimes

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
old-school mold makers can sometimes

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.300 
old-school mold makers can sometimes
they<00:03:58.340> put<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.450> know<00:03:59.540> wooden<00:03:59.900> dowels<00:04:00.140> in<00:04:00.590> their

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
they put you know wooden dowels in their

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.090 
they put you know wooden dowels in their
mold<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:02.000> four<00:04:02.269> points<00:04:02.980> basically<00:04:03.980> you

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
mold so have four points basically you

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.800 
mold so have four points basically you
just<00:04:04.130> set<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.579> over<00:04:04.700> just<00:04:05.000> like<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.120> table<00:04:05.600> and

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
just set that over just like a table and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.660 
just set that over just like a table and
that'll<00:04:06.970> rest<00:04:07.970> on<00:04:08.120> its<00:04:08.239> own<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:09.489> we're<00:04:10.489> doing

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
that'll rest on its own but we're doing

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.340 
that'll rest on its own but we're doing
the<00:04:10.730> quick<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.060> dirty<00:04:11.090> version<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.140> we're<00:04:12.290> not

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
the quick and dirty version so we're not

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.950 
the quick and dirty version so we're not
going<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.530> be<00:04:12.620> doing<00:04:12.799> that
