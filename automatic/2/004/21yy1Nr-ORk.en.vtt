00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
going to be working on going from level

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to be working on going from level
to<00:00:54.449> level<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.079> game<00:00:55.320> maker<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.860> that's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to level with in game maker and that's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010

shall be the N Phi of course and that's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.450 
shall be the N Phi of course and that's
it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

to<00:02:02.969> level<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.780> let's<00:02:03.810> make<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> new<00:02:04.829> room<00:02:05.070> real

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
to level so let's make a new room real

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.010 
to level so let's make a new room real
quick<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> we'll<00:02:05.670> call<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.259> rename<00:02:07.580> test

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
quick and we'll call this a rename test

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.979 
quick and we'll call this a rename test
level

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
level

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.160 
level
-<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.340> we'll<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.459> lay<00:02:13.670> down<00:02:13.700> our<00:02:14.360> wall

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
- and we'll just lay down our wall

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.819 
- and we'll just lay down our wall
sprite<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.989> once<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.379> here<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.069> oh<00:02:20.829> sorry

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
that was one iPod ladies be seducing me

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.250 
that was one iPod ladies be seducing me
I'm<00:02:25.700> busy<00:02:25.909> right<00:02:26.269> now<00:02:26.299> we'll<00:02:26.870> get<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.109> him

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
I'm busy right now we'll get to him

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.960 
I'm busy right now we'll get to him
after<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.720> using<00:02:29.930> shift<00:02:30.470> I'm<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
after this so I'm using shift I'm the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.640 
after this so I'm using shift I'm the
left<00:02:32.390> mouse<00:02:32.599> button<00:02:32.629> to<00:02:33.049> lay<00:02:33.260> down<00:02:33.290> those

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
left mouse button to lay down those

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.259 
left mouse button to lay down those
tiles<00:02:33.890> like<00:02:34.159> it's<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.400> paintbrush<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.090> said

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
tiles like it's a paintbrush like I said

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.300 
tiles like it's a paintbrush like I said
in<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.390> previous<00:02:35.420> tutorial<00:02:35.780> now<00:02:36.650> let's<00:02:36.950> make

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
in a previous tutorial now let's make

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.849 
in a previous tutorial now let's make
our<00:02:37.519> player<00:02:37.879> have<00:02:38.569> our<00:02:38.689> player<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
our player have our player here and

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.300 
our player have our player here and
we'll<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.129> our<00:02:40.280> end<00:02:40.489> flag<00:02:41.290> here<00:02:42.290> all<00:02:42.980> right

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
we'll have our end flag here all right

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.670 
we'll have our end flag here all right
and<00:02:43.760> let's<00:02:43.879> make<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.359> the<00:02:44.659> first<00:02:44.810> room<00:02:45.349> in

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and let's make this the first room in

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.869 
and let's make this the first room in
the<00:02:45.769> game<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:47.379> what<00:02:48.379> what<00:02:48.680> have<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.489> do<00:02:49.790> we

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
the game so what what have what do we

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.110 
the game so what what have what do we
want<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.209> happen<00:02:50.359> we<00:02:51.079> want<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.400> when<00:02:52.700> we

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
want to happen we want so that when we

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.899 
want to happen we want so that when we
collide<00:02:53.599> with<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.319> end<00:02:54.560> flag<00:02:54.799> down<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.370> we

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
collide with this end flag down here we

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.039 
collide with this end flag down here we
move<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.870> next<00:02:57.049> level<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:58.280> right<00:02:58.489> now

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
move to the next level but right now

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.210 
move to the next level but right now
nothing's<00:03:00.049> happened<00:03:00.470> when<00:03:00.620> we<00:03:00.769> collide<00:03:01.069> with

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
nothing's happened when we collide with

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.569 
nothing's happened when we collide with
it

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
it

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.059 
it
well<00:03:02.000> let's<00:03:02.989> go<00:03:03.169> make<00:03:03.319> our<00:03:03.349> collision<00:03:03.829> event

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
well let's go make our collision event

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.000 
well let's go make our collision event
pretty<00:03:04.909> easy<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.480> event<00:03:05.810> collision<00:03:06.349> but<00:03:06.889> for

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
pretty easy at event collision but for

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.979 
pretty easy at event collision but for
our<00:03:07.069> end<00:03:07.280> flag<00:03:07.579> what<00:03:08.209> do<00:03:08.269> we<00:03:08.359> want<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.629> happen

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
our end flag what do we want to happen

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.809 
our end flag what do we want to happen
when<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.319> collide<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> friend<00:03:09.980> product<00:03:10.280> what<00:03:10.700> we

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
when we collide a friend product what we

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.729 
when we collide a friend product what we
want<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.120> go<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> next<00:03:12.109> level<00:03:12.470> we<00:03:12.530> want<00:03:12.680> to

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
want to go to the next level we want to

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.409 
want to go to the next level we want to
go<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:12.889> another<00:03:13.159> level<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.730> we're<00:03:14.150> gonna<00:03:14.239> come

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
go to another level so we're gonna come

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.140 
go to another level so we're gonna come
down<00:03:14.569> here<00:03:14.780> -<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.229> mean<00:03:15.889> -<00:03:16.159> yep<00:03:16.549> mean<00:03:16.790> -<00:03:16.970> and

this is gonna cause a little problem but

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.830 
this is gonna cause a little problem but
it's<00:03:37.519> something<00:03:38.000> big<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.419> just<00:03:38.569> something

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
it's something big it's just something

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
you need to be aware of so we run our

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.330 
you need to be aware of so we run our
game<00:03:40.909> and<00:03:41.209> actually<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.650> Deveny

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
game and actually the Deveny

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.460 
game and actually the Deveny
since<00:03:43.669> then<00:03:43.819> test<00:03:44.090> level<00:03:44.389> one<00:03:44.569> let<00:03:44.870> us<00:03:44.989> set<00:03:45.290> an

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
since then test level one let us set an

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.479 
since then test level one let us set an
end<00:03:45.739> flag<00:03:46.419> down<00:03:47.419> here<00:03:47.659> in<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.840> bottom<00:03:47.989> corner

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
end flag down here in the bottom corner

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.849 
end flag down here in the bottom corner
saying<00:03:49.489> we<00:03:49.669> finished<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.560> we'll<00:03:51.680> come

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
saying we finished it and so we'll come

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.069 
saying we finished it and so we'll come
over<00:03:51.889> here<00:03:52.430> we<00:03:53.060> go

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
over here we go

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.979 
over here we go
to<00:03:55.069> lie<00:03:55.250> before<00:03:55.430> flag<00:03:55.879> we<00:03:56.389> go<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.720> next

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
to lie before flag we go to the next

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.199 
to lie before flag we go to the next
level<00:03:57.349> that's<00:03:57.949> pretty<00:03:58.310> slick<00:03:58.639> huh<00:03:58.669> and<00:03:59.090> there

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
there's like there has to be a previous

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.340 
there's like there has to be a previous
level<00:04:32.970> when<00:04:33.480> you're<00:04:33.570> doing<00:04:33.780> all<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.050> stuff

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
delete

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.280 
delete
so<00:05:41.190> for<00:05:41.460> blocks<00:05:41.760> I<00:05:41.940> think<00:05:42.150> it's<00:05:42.270> how<00:05:42.390> tall<00:05:42.990> you

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
so for blocks I think it's how tall you

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.890 
so for blocks I think it's how tall you
should<00:05:43.530> make<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.770> like<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.430> get<00:05:44.580> through<00:05:44.900> so

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
should make it like to get through so

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.690 
should make it like to get through so
that's<00:05:46.080> uh<00:05:46.850> and<00:05:47.850> delete<00:05:48.360> him<00:05:50.510> three<00:05:52.340> and<00:05:53.340> then

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
that's uh and delete him three and then
