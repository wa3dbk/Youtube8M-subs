parallel park park out assist and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.429 
parallel park park out assist and
perpendicular<00:00:20.699> Park<00:00:21.330> Assist<00:00:21.660> let's<00:00:22.289> go

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
perpendicular Park Assist let's go

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
perpendicular Park Assist let's go
inside<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.580> how<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.880> three<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
inside now and see how all three of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.470 
inside now and see how all three of
these<00:00:24.300> work<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.039> hit<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.460> button<00:00:26.789> one

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
these work so if I hit the button one

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
these work so if I hit the button one
time<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> start<00:00:28.619> scanning<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
time it's going to start scanning for a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.299 
time it's going to start scanning for a
parallel<00:00:30.029> spot<00:00:30.740> okay<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
parallel spot okay so I'm going to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
parallel spot okay so I'm going to
straighten<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> start<00:00:33.540> driving

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
straighten out here and start driving

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.750 
straighten out here and start driving
past<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> spot<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> detects<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
past the spot and see if it detects it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.130 
past the spot and see if it detects it
okay<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> said<00:00:39.329> spot<00:00:39.690> found<00:00:39.989> pull<00:00:40.860> forward

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
okay so it said spot found pull forward

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
okay so it said spot found pull forward
shift<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.350> reverse<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:45.420> I'm

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
shift to reverse and then I'm

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
shift to reverse and then I'm
controlling<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.379> brake<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> accelerator

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
controlling the brake and accelerator

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.479 
controlling the brake and accelerator
pedal<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.239> hands-free<00:00:48.719> steering<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
pedal it's just hands-free steering so I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.380 
pedal it's just hands-free steering so I
can<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.059> slow<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.719> feel<00:00:51.930> comfortable

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.930 

how<00:00:58.930> fast<00:00:59.230> can<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.559> really<00:00:59.739> go<00:00:59.950> with<00:01:00.160> this<00:01:00.309> you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
how fast can you really go with this you

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.960 
how fast can you really go with this you
can<00:01:01.090> go<00:01:01.239> up<00:01:01.329> to<00:01:01.510> 10<00:01:01.690> kph<00:01:02.200> which<00:01:02.829> is<00:01:02.980> very<00:01:03.579> fast

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
can go up to 10 kph which is very fast

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.760 
can go up to 10 kph which is very fast
yeah<00:01:05.040> which<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.280> equivalent<00:01:06.370> of<00:01:06.729> about

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
yeah which is the equivalent of about

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.980 
yeah which is the equivalent of about
766<00:01:08.770> yeah<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.729> then<00:01:10.240> I've<00:01:10.360> got<00:01:10.390> my<00:01:10.720> base

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
766 yeah and then I've got my base

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.340 
766 yeah and then I've got my base
parkade<00:01:11.530> system<00:01:12.070> here<00:01:12.460> which<00:01:13.030> shows<00:01:13.540> me<00:01:13.960> on

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
parkade system here which shows me on

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.010 
parkade system here which shows me on
all<00:01:14.619> of<00:01:14.890> my<00:01:15.100> surroundings<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:16.180> where<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
all of my surroundings and where the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020 
all of my surroundings and where the
chimes<00:01:17.320> are<00:01:17.530> actually<00:01:17.920> coming<00:01:18.130> from<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:18.880> it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
chimes are actually coming from so it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.090 
chimes are actually coming from so it
helps<00:01:19.479> during<00:01:19.780> active<00:01:20.200> Park<00:01:20.440> Assist<00:01:20.560> because

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
helps during active Park Assist because

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.160 
helps during active Park Assist because
I<00:01:21.190> get<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.369> feel<00:01:21.700> for<00:01:21.970> how<00:01:22.119> close<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.630> am<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.840> the

steer you control brake and gas and it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.310 
steer you control brake and gas and it
controls<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:37.000> steering<00:01:37.509> guess<00:01:37.750> you're<00:01:38.289> the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
controls a steering guess you're the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.889 
controls a steering guess you're the
sensor<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.830> Pittsburgh<00:01:39.810> listen<00:01:40.810> just<00:01:42.899> tell

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
sensor in Pittsburgh listen just tell

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.419 
sensor in Pittsburgh listen just tell
you<00:01:44.110> first<00:01:46.320> try<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.380> straighten<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.070> out<00:01:48.190> as

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
you first try to straighten it out as

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:55.740 
you first try to straighten it out as
best<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.030> can<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:53.789> okay<00:01:54.789> okay

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
best as it can and that's it okay okay

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.190 
best as it can and that's it okay okay
so<00:01:55.899> if<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.259> hit<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.619> button<00:01:56.649> now<00:01:57.100> I'm<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.700> park

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so if I hit the button now I'm in park

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.190 
so if I hit the button now I'm in park
it<00:01:59.200> offers<00:01:59.830> park<00:02:00.190> out<00:02:00.310> assist<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:01.080> in<00:02:02.080> this

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
it offers park out assist and in this

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.380 
it offers park out assist and in this
case<00:02:02.470> I'm<00:02:02.829> free<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.159> both<00:02:03.460> sides<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.090> can

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
case I'm free on both sides so I can

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.899 
case I'm free on both sides so I can
choose<00:02:04.750> using<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> turn<00:02:05.710> signal<00:02:06.250> which<00:02:06.640> side

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
choose using the turn signal which side

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.699 
choose using the turn signal which side
I<00:02:06.939> want<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.299> steer<00:02:07.570> out<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.440> I'm<00:02:08.500> going<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
I want to steer out of so I'm going to

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:24.830 
I want to steer out of so I'm going to
choose<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.070> left<00:02:09.280> side<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:13.120> shift<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.510> reverse

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.000 

shift<00:02:25.840> forward<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:31.260> then<00:02:32.260> as<00:02:32.470> soon<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:32.860> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
shift forward and then as soon as it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.740 
shift forward and then as soon as it
knows<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.880> steered<00:02:34.420> me<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
knows that I'm it steered me in the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.190 
knows that I'm it steered me in the
right<00:02:34.840> direction<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.750> make<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.960> it

coverage<00:03:54.600> as<00:03:54.750> well<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.290> for<00:03:55.470> example<00:03:55.560> if<00:03:55.890> I'm

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
coverage as well so for example if I'm

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.280 
coverage as well so for example if I'm
pulling<00:03:56.490> out<00:03:56.610> here<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.660> making<00:03:58.020> me<00:03:58.140> aware

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
pulling out here it's making me aware

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.949 
pulling out here it's making me aware
that<00:03:58.770> I'm<00:03:58.890> getting<00:03:59.069> very<00:03:59.190> close<00:03:59.670> if<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.660> start

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
that I'm getting very close if I start

steering<00:04:01.319> away<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.890> chimes<00:04:02.220> get<00:04:02.610> less<00:04:02.940> less

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
steering away the chimes get less less

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
steering away the chimes get less less
critical<00:04:04.230> because<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.830> knows<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.040> I'm

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
critical because it knows that I'm
