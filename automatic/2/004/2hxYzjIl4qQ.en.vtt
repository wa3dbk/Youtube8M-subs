00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.170
 na ana 14 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.400
 in the workshop we have a toyota camry 1999 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.079
 with a vote two points 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.300
 and 1,331 thousand kilometers of travel 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.869
 they have no driving problem but the mission manager has failed 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.720
 and also 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.800
 has a fault code p 0 4 4 6 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.649
 the code 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.629
 p 0 4 4 6 indicates that the computer has discovered a leak when the vacuum 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.629
 move from the valve to the holding tank 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.230
 during a test of the mission opposition system 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.380
 could indicate 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.610
 a problem that in the holding tank 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.380
 the valve hoses the electrical installation 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.490
 today weigh 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.410
 our first action was to perish at 26 to waste and some fails 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.000
 common 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.040
 with this code for this vehicle 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.980
 and indeed there he was 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.690
 the vast majority of causes of this code end up replacing that the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.330
 holding deposit 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 but the change this unit 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 it's a cost option 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.800
 we would feel calmer with the change if we can assure it that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 deposited again the cause of the problem 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 This unit is located on the rear suspension 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.660
 next to the front of the fuel tank 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.380
 the only way to check 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.770
 the problem is like a crane or elevated mechanism 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 so that he has lifted 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.290
 As you can see until some this equipment the deposit is difficult to reach 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.410
 first we check the hoses electrical connection 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.030
 everything seems fine 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.860
 this is the time to talk about her loyal to the deposit and tobago in the frame 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.930
 of the workshop 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 to take out the tank you will have to lower the exhaust system 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.280
 several tips 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.220
 and even so 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.840
 it will be fair 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.900
 and think shaking the deposit that checking all ways do not have 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.580
 coal waste 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.450
 50 coal the deposit must be changed and its plan 2000e 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.689
 before continuing with the remaining diagnosis in this system 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.290
 first you must verify 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.390
 if we have positivity of steam emissions action with design traveled with 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.319
 nine 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.449
 this is indicated by the profit motive 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.929
 like that diagram 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.659
 we see that it is an old design model 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.069
 that design 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.370
 it is public of the fear that here that includes 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.819
 a three-day lazio valve 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.869
 the new designs use a step valve 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.220
 I was in a relationship 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.729
 has three collections 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:44.399
 one hour to deposit another person and you do not have to debug and last to the sensor 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:46.209
 of pressure 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.109
 after 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.159
 we apply the voltage of a 9-volt battery to the electrical connection one 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.559
 vacuum valve 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.549
 by doing this 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.209
 must be heard a click 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.259
 but what happens is that 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.649
 we tried but we did not hear anything 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.029
 he bought us the valve is defective 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.219
 and due to the design the complete deposit of changes 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:08.389
 rushmore like 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.889
 for that family 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.879
 a defect in a valve 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.090
 but let's take a scientific look at stealing a new deposit 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.469
 you need a game of gentlemen and ladies 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.450
 A battery 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.069
 again diego 12 volts 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.259
 and two vacuum pumps 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.680
 connect the pump pneumatic salamander denounced that under the 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.559
 valve to the pressure sensor 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:40.449
 and álava 9 points 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.529
 with this the auxiliary cable to the sun does not live from the vacuum valve 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.539
 but I did not activate it yet 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.470
 bonvehí the pneumatic valve 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.990
 connected with the hose 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.079
 that was in the pressure sensor 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.179
 and should not accumulate empty 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.859
 activity the vacuum valve and I used the same pump 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.599
 you should have now vacuum accumulation both meters 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.349
 relative when I got about 18 inches 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.089
 disconnect the battery 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.289
 and hermosillo should be kept constant in the meter connected to the 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.289
 natural valve for at least two days according to 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.349
 reconnect battery 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.520
 and evasion this meter asked chain to be 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 if it works however evasion work stressed 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.979
 now he only invests in sports 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.009
 change the deposit and eliminate the fault codes 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.090
 this vehicles will now pass the missions test 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.029
 and we will have a happy driver 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.319
 we will see you soon in the next time with the furniture workshop
