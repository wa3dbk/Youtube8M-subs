00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.780
 well before you start doing this 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:17.140
 French manicure I will say that in my 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.310
 personal case I have my nails like 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.640
 appreciate here with the little defined line 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.390
 very transparent to I have enough shovel 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:32.140
 but but I do not like the shape of my one 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.810
 and then for me to make these stripes 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.750
 they are straight instead of using the 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.220
 molds that are sold in any 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.590
 perfumery in the Chinese in any 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 site to perform the manicure as a 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.620
 I like them that way, straight, not with the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.170
 flange measured inwards has 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 rounded that I do not like anything because I 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.969
 I use masking tape masking tape 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.690
 is this in my case used this which is 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.750
 a little more white 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.940
 for me to see the edge better but they can 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 use any any tape 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.200
 normal adhesive that they have at home and I 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.560
 I've always done it with the normal I have 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.610
 is now because I found and it comes 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.950
 much better but that is not necessary 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.030
 with buying it simply that by way of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.399
 of opinion I think that is more is more 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.070
 to make it effective we will 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.720
 simply need 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.600
 White paint 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.430
 this one in pretty white concrete is not 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.080
 of very good quality but for what the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.960
 I want to serve me, it's pretty white 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.000
 because I wear 22 back layers 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.720
 to finish and I like to see the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 white effect and this painting for 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.620
 finalize who is from inglott 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.450
 specifically it is the number 8 64 in 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.920
 camera looks very white but it is not so 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.150
 white and leaves a pretty finish 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.150
 pretty good 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.670
 we're going to need acetone 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.670
 Y 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.710
 to do a little touch- up 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.119
 example I'll take this brush 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.990
 This is a brush that I bought in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.670
 premiums thinking about using it to 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.080
 extend the makeup base but it 's 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.760
 very bad to extend base of 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.770
 Make a very cheap brush very 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.500
 bad that does not mean that because it's 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.120
 cheap is bad but it gave the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.120
 coincidence that it is very cheap and is very 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.650
 bad and then how come together 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.270
 brochita also for corrector yo 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.319
 I use is for corrector that is 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.140
 tiny, hard and quite dense 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.900
 and make a few tweaks in the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.480
 nails when we need it and finally 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.879
 we will need a towel to remove the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.530
 excess of good enamel 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.430
 simply what I'm going to do 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.230
 is put pieces of tape 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.739
 around the nail marking the line 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:05.500
 alright so I show it and it taught me how 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:09.410
 I do it good here I already have the line 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.400
 marked with the adhesive tape 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.340
 and it's simply saying that you have to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.379
 tighten well 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.870
 the edges where we're going to paint for 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.170
 that the paint does not leak and we do not know 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.970
 stay 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.920
 very bad because although it can be corrected 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.349
 Well, if it works well the first time 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.140
 much better so nothing simply 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:35.210
 will be pick up the paint 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.600
 will begin to fill in painting even 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.420
 above the tape because 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.340
 nothing is going to happen the nail is protected 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.920
 and this is the result of once I've 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.440
 removed the tape and I have to say 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.209
 that I remove the super fast tape not 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.640
 I do not even think it's been three minutes 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.640
 because to show how you can stay 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.080
 the nail when you take it off quickly when 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.610
 It has not dried well as it stays by 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.610
 example of this 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.730
 from this one the flange 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.730
 how is it 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.840
 gotten up 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.120
 and also show that the tape what 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.729
 has is that it leaves 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.979
 the glue on the nail then that's why 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:29.120
 I'm going to teach the little trick that 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:32.780
 I have to do what 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.870
 this disappears we take the acetone the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.200
 open we put the plug and pour a 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.290
 bit 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.190
 very little acetone in the cap 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.450
 we take the towel and the brush that 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.270
 previously I taught wet we removed the 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.260
 excess and simply what we're going to 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.260
 do is 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.590
 remove 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.590
 the glue 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.250
 with small touches 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.250
 and in the case of imperfections 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.040
 and correct them 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:18.120
 here I also have a little bit 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.009
 plus 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.559
 stepped out 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.169
 so nothing is correct little by little and 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.509
 patiently but as soon as 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.699
 do it several times already 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.800
 it comes out and it's quite useful and pretty 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.009
 fast so nothing now we move on to 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.849
 put the final layer of enamel as nothing 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.229
 once 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.720
 finished the last layer of enamel be 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:48.760
 more or less the result 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.760
 those that come out perfect but 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.040
 I find pretty pretty pretty is 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.250
 a very simple way to do it and I think 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.830
 that everyone can try and with a 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.220
 little bit of practice will come out 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.320
 fast and it's very simple so nothing 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.620
 I hope they put it into practice and that 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.620
 you liked it
