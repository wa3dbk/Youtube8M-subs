00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.839
 This will make everyone today a very well known 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.140
 Game principle before 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.920
 and the child's important risk the board game you might have 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.060
 played a fun and is actually about it 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.100
 which rule to seize so nothing that you just in the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.070
 Lunch break we thought we had one anyway 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.890
 Possibility in the lunch break, we do not participate 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.860
 our newest is playing month or have a quick look 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.090
 then I've prepared something 'we were first we look 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.100
 us that the interface is making it pretty good we can now 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.909
 various 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.559
 Choosing options among others our drivers or what should happen then I should 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.229
 decide for thoroughly MarkgrÃ¶ningen state indirectly with the 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.479
 first in the world 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.199
 There are many certainly challenging without you possibly 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.249
 All over Europe you have to keep the whole world coming later 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 has a task in the case with europacup- Europe on here gets for it 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.030
 a certain amount of families come to our case the first families we 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.060
 to a country of our choice which we already have parties 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.790
 relatively simple click on the country and then gives the to MEMC if you're in 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 occupied by several countries or later in view of the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.540
 get creeping then you have to accept more 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.760
 is clearly click here and according to Xerox Folies 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.350
 that explains everything well I have to take my hand now 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.130
 placed then click on next step and can now look 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 where the army should serve 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.210
 I'll check okay in Ukraine and if he shows up and says Hintz two 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.689
 Watch a little tip if you have one 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.330
 "We tried Obama like that 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 then you should have at least twice as many in him in the country 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.470
 available 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.020
 I have it so that it should continue to work 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.960
 December is on six dates 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.360
 but I still can not do with five attachments to a pattern in the country 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.820
 Of course I also can not say no, no, not at all 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.859
 think again 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.809
 but I do not start now that you can see that that no 

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.900
 normal post you go adversary who or what poverty 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.909
 I did it 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.139
 this is the complete area 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.719
 the war I have for you have seen more accept because I am the whole day 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.710
 the whole area 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.709
 I now get set instead of 5 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.329
 at the ten armies 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.339
 and now I just did the jump 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.499
 because that's not the whole game, of course 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.230
 In principle, there is something really going on 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.569
 Among other things, it gets more complicated because later you can not 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.060
 that means you do not know which opponent is sitting 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.330
 then we are there on this labeled line and, above all, how many assume 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.409
 has this opponent 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.939
 Doctors need to attack the market 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.150
 By the way, you can also abbreviate it 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.819
 I'm shut up, they finally did in Germany 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.469
 Sony might give it 2 and then you will be shown immediately if you won 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.870
 or not here she will be so close to me I have the whole world 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.220
 conquers everything is green 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.089
 beautiful 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.900
 and percent more still indicated that I needed 19 moves for it 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.959
 There are 20 events in total until my best time 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.509
 Now first to the next level or I'll show you how 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.009
 It looks like if he had the right game off that partially had to be relocated here 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.719
 gets pretty complicated 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.680
 the MAZeT there are quite a lot of different colors on this card 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.509
 means I have a lot of different opponents 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.739
 and the bad thing is I do not care how strong we are and they are not where 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.359
 but all are distributed but Kopper what nice cushion to the light 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.599
 from Monday are exactly cards because for every conquered land you get 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.279
 a card Fini on three days together from then he gets more accept again 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.219
 in the second six we have now 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.379
 Of course, if there are so many opponents, it is also a bit complicated 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.719
 So you can not just go wild - just think about it 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.019
 per year 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:46.889
 placed 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.359
 today we know that the focus is only on the winner and the mistakes increase 30 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.109
 can attack 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.109
 and since I already get one of three cards I'm sorry 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.180
 For you, of course, watch more again, it would be almost a whole again 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.519
 Land or, of course, I get back more 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.510
 the problem with the whole thing is because this fog is there I do not see 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.849
 how many armies my opponent is standing in front of me 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.459
 I have only two now but we have it everywhere, of course 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.739
 I have already seen that I can cash every checkout and have twice 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.620
 this card would have to be one 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.060
 and then, not least, got more 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.110
 and so come in the course of the game Stoffel proper amount of Armenia and 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.990
 to the course still wonderful placement since I see 17 here 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.060
 you already have one hundred princes take my opponent 110 30 and it will 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.910
 That's why I can only recommend you to be really long and complicated 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.500
 Look at the game necessarily 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.930
 especially if the possible strategy fansite 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.320
 because the principle has been proven for years risk but probably 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.250
 most popular game and this variant is the solid acted and so sophisticated 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.360
 that's really fun let the minimalist do not let you 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.909
 deceive 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.439
 that's the name behind the ears and that's why it should be 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.439
 play game I'm curious in the side this says contactor 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.900
 1 is
