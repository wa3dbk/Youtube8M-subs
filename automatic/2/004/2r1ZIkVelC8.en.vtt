progressive rate spring gets stiffer as

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.060

it goes through the stroke so that's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.859 
it goes through the stroke so that's
gonna<00:01:20.189> help<00:01:20.520> reduce<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.240> amount<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> jarring
