00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
guys of course stronger but most times

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.750

there<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.110> troll<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> cage<00:03:20.280> or<00:03:20.549> so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
there is like a troll in the cage or so

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.130 
there is like a troll in the cage or so
and<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.989> rating<00:03:22.530> combatant<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:24.140> from

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
and it's just rating combatant so from

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.670 
and it's just rating combatant so from
what<00:03:25.290> I've<00:03:25.410> seen<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.820> beasts<00:03:27.480> actually<00:03:28.320> win

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
what I've seen the beasts actually win

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.100 
what I've seen the beasts actually win
all<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.220> times<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.900> could<00:03:31.079> be

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
all the times but that could be

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.660 
all the times but that could be
different<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.860> saw<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> couple<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.430> fights

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
different I just saw a couple of fights

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.390 
different I just saw a couple of fights
so<00:03:32.940> far<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:34.320> should<00:03:34.530> definitely<00:03:34.739> try<00:03:35.280> this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
so far you should definitely try this

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.880 
so far you should definitely try this
mod<00:03:35.730> not<00:03:35.970> because<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.570> fun<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.650> also

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
mod not because it's fun but also

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.910 
mod not because it's fun but also
because<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.820> doesn't<00:03:39.390> have<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.750> potential<00:03:40.530> to

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
because it doesn't have the potential to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.400 
because it doesn't have the potential to
have<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.340> lot<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.640> mod<00:03:42.000> conflicts<00:03:42.720> with<00:03:43.170> the
