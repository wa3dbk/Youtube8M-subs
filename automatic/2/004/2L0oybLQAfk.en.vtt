00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
think the gold kind of really brings

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.680 
think the gold kind of really brings
this<00:05:00.740> look<00:05:00.979> back<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.490> not<00:05:01.639> be<00:05:01.819> super<00:05:02.060> bold<00:05:02.449> and

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
this look back to not be super bold and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.020 
this look back to not be super bold and
still<00:05:02.900> keeps<00:05:03.139> out<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.409> natural<00:05:03.889> side<00:05:04.099> so<00:05:05.000> I

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
still keeps out the natural side so I

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.339 
still keeps out the natural side so I
really<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.509> way<00:05:05.599> that<00:05:05.750> looks<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.259> I'm
