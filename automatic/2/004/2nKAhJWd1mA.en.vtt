00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.210
 recently, the pt are first but online 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.429
 gone and that I am under 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.690
 sebastian stands beside me so treasures 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.170
 I have you played a match on 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.080
 the pc exactly patch 2.20 complete 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 many classes set changes and that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.490
 Let's have a look at the condensation water set 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.699
 from the wizard 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.710
 this causes the 2er set bonus the meter 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 from the sky always comes when we do not 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.290
 Cold fire or lightning attacks act 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.300
 the set of four now causes ours 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
 resistances increased for 6 seconds 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 always be when we are exactly the same 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.879
 hurting looks cool so it turns 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.860
 all about these four elements now at 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.239
 Terrassa set means if I am now 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 I have to have one before that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.300
 make him harm so he will be very happy 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.910
 if you are alone on holidays then use 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.500
 this metro comes around 80 customers cola 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 and if you use feu attacks 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.949
 increase your fire resistance 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 exactly so when I him before against from 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.750
 I have to neck before that exactly 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 118 which is unfortunately still the 6 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 set today our damage in the 75th 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.760
 even if we fire or cold 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.710
 use lightning or akan skills 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.500
 So if everything mixed together once through 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.330
 and there is a quicker and more open page 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.640
 a necklace we can the national 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.470
 and I just see something the blizzcon 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 elemental exactly this is a new ring 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.060
 on the ptr it probably only one 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.540
 platzhalter attended the causes yet 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 times it that way in one second frequency all 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.720
 five seconds so the elements 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 change and again our damage 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.770
 increase so well fits the set 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
 we are shocked by the abilities 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.350
 impulse with through long ball blizzard 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.630
 with snowed in meteor with star grabs 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.430
 the teleport we still have in it and the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.820
 hydra for 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.460
 with mom, we even have cold 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.930
 We have lightning and fire here 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.520
 We can mix everything colorfully 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.130
 so arrive on time and on 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.680
 the ring passive hamm was what we have 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.050
 there in there then in the elements 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 exposed so also fits very well that 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.459
 again increases the susceptibility of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.070
 monster depending on which elements like 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.340
 use if we are still blurred 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.709
 in it for a bit passive defensive 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.170
 So little tapas trale presence because 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.860
 we play with star and the l 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 draws us immediately all the power away 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.680
 if it does, but then causes 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.730
 We also have pro ak force points 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.300
 not so much more technically 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.130
 bad at 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.250
 So that's just a picture always 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.080
 So rausgepickt will show whether 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.190
 you will become such a good picture 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.620
 probably come sometime 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 wants to heck with eventually everything 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.530
 seen already instead of girls with energy 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.500
 whirl and there is one actually up 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.980
 in the great work first level 1 50 done 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 in 51 red information in the jargon that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.549
 it's pretty good 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.830
 so I barely manage it at 46 though 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.799
 So even with advertising here can now 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.090
 Let's see these are like ours 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.280
 increase resistance if we just 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.380
 use the attacks because lightning 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.810
 use our skills to hear our 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:21.600
 but lightning already resisted a lot 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.430
 or 100 so far a bit more than 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.860
 Otherwise, it does not know exactly how it works 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.480
 scales but you're at 5000 this 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.019
 quite untouchable 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.400
 Actually , what's missing is magath 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:38.000
 no poison and active against jan right on 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.960
 ground might be even more 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.730
 a bit good household in black by 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.620
 satellite or or this amulet or 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.500
 so then if you are almost so to speak 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.640
 invincible immortal of course gets 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.390
 still a bit on the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.160
 want to bake 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.890
 we do not have any physical damage either 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.620
 Exactly who wonders why so many 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.440
 james dry the course of the 2008 from 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.310
 pc but you did not have that was only 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.170
 short time active 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.610
 that's just there to give you one 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.870
 can try out some 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.580
 we can see it done successfully 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.890
 because if the clean live kids wants 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.280
 Of course, everyone can achieve successes and 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.680
 Hunting records means so it wants to 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.120
 Simply blizzard must shop.com pulse 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.410
 in here and it's enough already 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.970
 with the then down with the place 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.820
 The baggage can be used now completely 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.669
 Nice to see if the tenant hits 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.160
 it can even be 900 million kritt 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.390
 very nice that's right 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.140
 Strong with the metal we are told 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.930
 here paragon level 2 770 no games 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.680
 no perfect items somehow leveled 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.419
 Strange keeps open if it does not fit 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.610
 In any case, you can do even more 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.229
 get out with firebirds you will 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.290
 probably even faster through the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.790
 six are on 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.760
 but I think for the credits 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.979
 are already enormously called a faster 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.380
 then I think its the game as 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:10.190
 then the great rift progresses yet 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.470
 as the fire threatens but with sex.com 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.419
 even by my god there you can still 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.640
 Let's see how Stern grabs 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.640
 you can haul it in without just getting started 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.979
 700 121 million normal 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.510
 neat weakness is of course 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.410
 the pictures now, incidentally, just once 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.870
 have searched out 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.850
 the area of rent was not quite like that 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.620
 wide so who has to bully exactly in there 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.080
 but you can not stand there maybe 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.450
 even with the mark so with the 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.930
 celebration that the sfv uses the 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.370
 opponents together and one man 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.960
 You could actually exactly or you 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.910
 can also all at midday one 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.400
 bullet or energy whirl or what 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.020
 really like that fits the game is 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.780
 not like the firebirds that one 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.880
 you can do so relatively little choice 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.830
 really pull everything so pure 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.750
 what you want with the four elements ever 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.850
 after which one gets along best 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.470
 and where you have the most fun of course 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.710
 it is then that bands again enter the 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.300
 then you have the non-plus-ultra result 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.430
 does it always have to play like that ? 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.139
 said the best I've seen so far 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.449
 now made with energy vortex 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.009
 Almost almost form themselves 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.960
 of course a little more defensive yet 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.759
 Of course he has the perfect one too 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.440
 had equipment for it and he has then 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.160
 in the great rift introduction to managed 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.870
 if we met that properly for the 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.020
 he is four groups in great rift 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.430
 now again, so to speak and top 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.289
 you can use them again now or 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.400
 it is better in any case better than 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.289
 I should say firebird 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.220
 but there are in other videos with 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.830
 friday probably still show 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.289
 are still a certain way with 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.120
 the whole new set of the magician that is 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:53.490
 then probably more for group play 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.500
 Old age set in any case, even quiet 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.909
 say better than firebird 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.710
 group game but one can ever say 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.690
 After all, what else can one do for skills and 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.150
 probably still black hole or something 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.669
 a bit together then pull the 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.419
 group support water are also right 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.360
 take quickly 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.460
 if we have to look again if we have to 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.370
 step schotten can therefore look 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.849
 when our here to conring 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.520
 elemental damage 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.020
 and then meteor 100 me 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.979
 already works well but hit something 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.889
 because it's fast 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:25.499
 so if I need boards on it 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.729
 much longer because they explode after 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:29.159
 the mox of that is a little bit to me 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:32.849
 depending on each case one 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.800
 Revision at the complete patch 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:38.099
 probably so in two months to 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.990
 There so build yourself nice wait times 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.429
 watch what i still change but that on 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.849
 every case worth a look with the 

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:43.849
 new patch
