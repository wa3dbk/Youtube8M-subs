00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 then he will turn to 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:10.799
 it's time for a change 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.549
 to the system unit that is available 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.169
 I decided to pick me up 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.180
 modern lcd monitor then 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.019
 modernized inkjet printer 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.509
 and then connect as local networks 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.060
 program Maidan sit is not clear 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 it's time to start the journey 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.519
 Kopatko shopping places 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.710
 now with the decision of its consumer 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.399
 Well, what about the acquisition? 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.830
 non-professionals of the world of e-books 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.620
 We start with the acquisition of LCD 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.040
 monitor 7 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.260
 when shopping on your quite a few prices on your 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.240
 a place to twin our attention to external 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
 monitors because it often happens that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.570
 the monitor may be just a few months 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.290
 demolished chassis model 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.270
 and you just try to seller 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.570
 say that the faces of the robot monitors then 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.040
 it is necessary to spoil the appearance of course 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.960
 because the percentage 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.250
 when the monitor is on display 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.400
 time lecturers can be hard 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.900
 dust can appear on the square 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.940
 on the body 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.459
 from the answer rub 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:04.860
 bath and just was not 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560
 at sight 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.960
 then we are not the center after highway slip 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.340
 the right choice of customs 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.090
 do it yourself 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660
 but I got a full market consultation 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.130
 housing one of the houses 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 new stores for sale 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820
 computer technology 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.950
 interests me as I have already said 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.110
 liquid crystal 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.550
 I heard that they distinguish the machine 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 what it is 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.740
 different ratings and team 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.830
 type matrix 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.480
 respectively from 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.350
 diagonals 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 the information we have is the differences in installation 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 in the second orphanages 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.890
 appeal 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.900
 their goods 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.180
 but she insisted the most common 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.230
 the matrix at the moment went to mother 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.350
 on production 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.530
 and after all for home use 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 ordinary user house 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.070
 hockey and practical 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.070
 can not watch movies 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.579
 cost in the first denied 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.729
 varies from 5 channel compliance 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.889
 You can take a diagonal of 15 inches 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.119
 which will be 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.939
 850 900 hryvnia 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.889
 also dependent on the company 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.489
 and correspondingly 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 also a fact July 26 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.139
 than parties 30 champion of this very 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.439
 cheap 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.439
 not the color rendition of the evening poetess and 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.449
 not so good i mean black 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.449
 this attack of dark colors 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.459
 does not hurt a pixel example is expressed 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.379
 bright spot 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.559
 road corner less tourists up to a hundred 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.079
 seventy degrees oz goes but mostly 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.229
 it's less 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.689
 This is 160 165 declared but can really be 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:56.979
 it is better 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.829
 I will spend at the computer they 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.569
 settled down 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.009
 and here's a question 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.249
 same diagonal size 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.199
 optimal for quality 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.539
 view image on 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.829
 monitor and right there time is safe for 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.659
 health of my body if not 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:11.949
 will be 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.379
 percentage of optimal diagonal data 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.889
 at the doctor the optimal length southeast 19 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.289
 inches at the moment 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.079
 taking into account the price and quality 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.689
 activity 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.379
 in all functionality this 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.529
 all the same and 22 inches 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.429
 that is, the price is much more than half 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.329
 make up about 300 400 hryvnia but you 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.099
 get us 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.629
 a certain number of big 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.719
 screens 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.219
 with one centimeter speaker 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.549
 This score is 19 films 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.189
 same March 20th you get 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.540
 plus 6 centimeters of the screen all the same there 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.509
 many years 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.819
 well, the front is much better 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.809
 so what else should I turn 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:52.759
 attention when buying a LCD 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.659
 can on its design 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.689
 rub but I want to pay attention 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.409
 before choosing monitors 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.959
 and first of all, there were two exams 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:02.599
 tour 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.909
 so behind the monitor can be to different 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.329
 say so percent 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.569
 may be completely flat 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.049
 in this case, this monitor and he goes 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.409
 in a separate power supply why city hall 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.649
 so flat 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.769
 percent no rest issue so rest 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.259
 models they go already with a built-in unit 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.889
 food due to this increase them in the thickness 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.439
 but 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.649
 when choosing a monitor you need to 

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:31.729
 pay attention to the viewing angles 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.370
 that is, grief review 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.300
 mostly rosy for application responses 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.139
 here I almost change you can see 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.139
 as it is not particularly review 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.490
 here's a percentage 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.050
 let's say so monitors are matrix again 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.069
 mostly used over 2 3 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.790
 brothers really ugpn gu city 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.930
 maximum 178 178 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.970
 in this case, the news of the bare zora 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.599
 170 to 170 degrees 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.979
 let's say it still does not sink in the third 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.080
 election promoter needs evaluation 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.930
 skp pay attention to the percentage of exits 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.370
 if there are several expressed 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.719
 outputs normal output 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.719
 passing the exit 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.960
 I am generous Ukrainians but brought up in economics 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.870
 can i care and want to monitor it 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.419
 strategic surface 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.210
 improvised means 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.430
 and how improper care can affect 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.210
 on image quality 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.199
 conductor case because the data 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.250
 means they may contain russia 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.749
 some me 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.089
 component that can damage and ooo 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.919
 superficial turks spoil a little could 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.309
 do harm plus nothing yet 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:59.199
 combat tap 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.490
 and you have lost your past monitor 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.719
 and so brightness contrast and not 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.009
 will be displayed about prince 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.490
 color rendition of the house 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.660
 in no case do not sleep 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.490
 I do not wipe in any way with 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.300
 discounted ordinary paper 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.599
 will not lose helped by cloths which 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.759
 help question it will be one bullet 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.639
 Thousands of shelves in this case is better more 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.419
 all because it's revenge enough 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.430
 expensive 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.520
 so it's best not to argue about 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.270
 improvised means we have here 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.479
 hospitalized 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.379
 here is the first step 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:33.159
 monitor 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.919
 go to the second spurt 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.770
 but also purchasing programs 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.619
 acute choice on the crisis 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.449
 why do you need to look at you
