 I know then in the comments 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.940

 she brings joy and fun extremely 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.969
 team play and cooperations is designed 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.710
 and of course also realistic 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.120
 Components contain who more exactly 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.980
 maybe a few left too 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 gameplay videos that are a bit longer 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.399
 project reality is announced again and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.699
 we are in the middle of nowhere as 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.090
 any separatists militia no 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.740
 idea 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:09.630
 The Russian is in front of the door and it is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 chaos it is absolute chaos one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.830
 front line where it goes currently sees 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.299
 just sorted out but out 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.299
 east direction are the tanks 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.610

 the maximum where also blue one 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:16.830
 perhaps also of sometimes thinks us 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.830
 it does not come through 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.680
 now our result comes from times 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.680

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.090
