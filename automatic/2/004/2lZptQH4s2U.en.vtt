00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this ball is really really hard but when

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.149

doesn't<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.060> hurt<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.540> much<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.409> don't

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
doesn't really hurt that much I don't

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300 
doesn't really hurt that much I don't
know<00:01:44.460> why<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.689> try<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.860> bare

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
know why but if you try it with bare

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.319 
know why but if you try it with bare
foot<00:01:48.409> there's<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.329> significant

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
foot there's really a significant

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.440 
foot there's really a significant
difference<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.770> try<00:01:53.070> played<00:01:53.450> barefoot

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
difference when you try played barefoot

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.609 
difference when you try played barefoot
that<00:01:54.899> maybe<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.850> freaking<00:01:57.479> hard<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that maybe it would be freaking hard to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.740 
that maybe it would be freaking hard to
kick<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.520> when<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> shoe

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
kick but when you use a shoe
