00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
picture let's start with the leg see

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
picture let's start with the leg see
that<00:01:03.180> has<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that has that and that has that but I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
that has that and that has that but I
think<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.460> how<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> supposed<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.330> I'm

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
think that's how it's supposed to be I'm

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 
think that's how it's supposed to be I'm
not<00:01:06.479> sure<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.400> if

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
not sure so I don't really know if

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
not sure so I don't really know if
that's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> mistake<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.540> otherwise<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that's a mistake or not otherwise I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
that's a mistake or not otherwise I
really<00:01:11.220> struggled<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.330> actually<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
really struggled with this actually this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
really struggled with this actually this
part<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.710> Paul<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.460> easy<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.880> some

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
part that Paul was very easy for some

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.350 
part that Paul was very easy for some
reason<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.479> partner<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> sword<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> another

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
reason this partner the sword is another

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
reason this partner the sword is another
mistake<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> colored<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
mistake the way that I colored it the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
mistake the way that I colored it the
sword<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.630> easy<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.140> draw

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
sword was actually not easy to draw

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
sword was actually not easy to draw
either<00:01:23.720> but<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.409> was<00:01:25.590> ok<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
either but it was ok now this in the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
either but it was ok now this in the
original<00:01:27.240> picture<00:01:27.840> had<00:01:28.110> more<00:01:28.560> detail<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
original picture had more detail in it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.370 
original picture had more detail in it
but<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.720> too<00:01:30.750> hard<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.170> me

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
but because it was way too hard for me

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.940 
but because it was way too hard for me
to<00:01:31.470> draw<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.090> decided<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.270> leave<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.020> know

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
