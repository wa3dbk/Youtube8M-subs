you have the running seconds and you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330 
you have the running seconds and you
have<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.540> minute<00:01:24.869> counter<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
have also the minute counter so the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.100 
have also the minute counter so the
chronograph<00:01:26.909> works<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.990> your

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
chronograph works like that on your

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.830 
chronograph works like that on your
wrist<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.210> your<00:01:30.390> wrist<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
wrist so if you have it on your wrist is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
wrist so if you have it on your wrist is
start/stop<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.530> reset<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> top

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
start/stop and the reset is on the top

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.850 
start/stop and the reset is on the top
in<00:01:36.270> here

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
in here

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.370 
in here
so<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.850> have<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> very<00:01:38.240> comfortable<00:01:39.140> way

so then you have a very comfortable way

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.950 
so then you have a very comfortable way
to<00:01:40.100> start<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.610> stop<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:41.060> actually<00:01:41.330> this<00:01:41.750> has

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
to start and stop and actually this has

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.720 
to start and stop and actually this has

it's actually my favorite your tur be on

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.920 
it's actually my favorite your tur be on
peace<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.610> idea<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> intention<00:02:23.750> was

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
peace so the idea and intention was

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.790 
peace so the idea and intention was
really<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.350> make<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> table<00:02:25.010> yo<00:02:25.270> chronograph

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
really to make a table yo chronograph

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.699 
really to make a table yo chronograph
automatic<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.670> see<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> back<00:02:29.709> so

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
automatic as you can see on the back so

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.550 
automatic as you can see on the back so
then<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:32.450> has<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.380> be

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
then all of this that has to be

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.250 
then all of this that has to be
shockproof

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
shockproof

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.380 
shockproof
now<00:02:36.260> it's<00:02:36.530> it's<00:02:36.860> very<00:02:36.950> difficult<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.090> make<00:02:38.240> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
now it's it's very difficult to make it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.690 
now it's it's very difficult to make it
to<00:02:38.570> be<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:38.870> mekinese<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.740> extremely<00:02:39.980> fun

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
and extremely complicated to to make and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.660 
and extremely complicated to to make and
to<00:02:43.730> assemble<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.630> make<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.709> shot<00:02:46.130> problem

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670

wanted to show us in this interview this
is<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.400> know<00:03:19.519> looking<00:03:20.180> perhaps<00:03:20.959> as<00:03:21.440> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
is you know looking perhaps as a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.970 
is you know looking perhaps as a
simplest<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.810> took<00:03:24.050> me<00:03:24.200> four<00:03:24.440> years<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.739> get

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
simplest that took me four years to get

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.490 
simplest that took me four years to get
there<00:03:25.250> it's<00:03:26.030> been<00:03:26.269> extremely<00:03:26.510> hard<00:03:27.019> for<00:03:27.110> me<00:03:27.350> to

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
there it's been extremely hard for me to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.540 
there it's been extremely hard for me to
make<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:28.160> watch<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.400> looks<00:03:29.030> still<00:03:29.780> as<00:03:29.930> grim

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
make so watch that looks still as grim

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.220 
make so watch that looks still as grim
but<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.910> was<00:03:32.120> makes<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.900> bit<00:03:33.080> more

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
but that was makes it a bit more
