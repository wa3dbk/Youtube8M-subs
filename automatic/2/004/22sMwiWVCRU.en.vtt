this<00:00:02.660> is<00:00:02.810> my<00:00:02.960> hho<00:00:03.800> generator<00:00:04.279> I<00:00:04.490> got<00:00:04.700> hooked<00:00:04.879> up

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
this is my hho generator I got hooked up

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.490 
this is my hho generator I got hooked up
kind<00:00:05.569> of<00:00:05.629> we<00:00:05.749> did<00:00:05.930> it<00:00:09.040> got<00:00:10.040> my<00:00:10.220> cord<00:00:10.520> running

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
kind of we did it got my cord running

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.560 
kind of we did it got my cord running
down<00:00:12.500> here<00:00:12.950> along<00:00:13.760> with<00:00:13.820> my<00:00:14.150> my<00:00:14.600> air<00:00:15.230> hose<00:00:16.570> air

where my fuel my gas is coming from my
my<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:27.259> hydrogen<00:00:27.829> comes<00:00:28.429> out<00:00:28.669> of<00:00:28.999> the<00:00:29.599> tank

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
my the hydrogen comes out of the tank

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.950 
my the hydrogen comes out of the tank
here<00:00:30.550> and<00:00:31.719> goes<00:00:32.719> into<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.289> this<00:00:33.859> is<00:00:34.840> just<00:00:35.840> an

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
here and goes into this this is just an

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.650 
here and goes into this this is just an
empty<00:00:36.260> jar<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:36.829> use<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:37.640> in<00:00:37.969> case<00:00:38.030> any

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
empty jar I use it so in case any

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.819 
empty jar I use it so in case any
bubbles<00:00:39.410> or<00:00:39.620> any<00:00:39.800> moisture<00:00:40.690> gets<00:00:41.690> into<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.170> it

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
gets trapped in that jar and then this

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
see that this is black because the light

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.809 
see that this is black because the light
is<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.880> intense<00:01:43.859> what<00:01:44.859> it<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.819> got

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
is so intense what it is and then I got

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.889 
is so intense what it is and then I got
the<00:01:49.179> MJ<00:01:49.630> Jo<00:01:49.869> hose<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.579> hydrogen<00:01:52.090> hose<00:01:52.299> going

the MJ Jo hose the hydrogen hose going

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.209 
the MJ Jo hose the hydrogen hose going
put<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> splitter<00:01:54.250> right<00:01:54.340> here<00:01:54.700> out<00:01:54.819> my<00:01:54.939> intake

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
put a splitter right here out my intake

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.699 
put a splitter right here out my intake
plug<00:01:57.219> it<00:01:57.369> right<00:01:57.549> in<00:01:57.729> there<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.799> little<00:02:00.340> T<00:02:00.640> valve

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
plug it right in there a little T valve

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.449 
plug it right in there a little T valve
and<00:02:02.709> that's<00:02:02.950> going<00:02:03.189> right<00:02:03.549> into<00:02:03.729> my<00:02:03.849> engine

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
and that's going right into my engine

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.589 
and that's going right into my engine
vacuum<00:02:06.459> pressure<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:07.090> going<00:02:07.299> into<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
vacuum pressure and then going into the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.119 
vacuum pressure and then going into the
intake<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.989> the<00:02:08.049> car<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.709> put<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.010> on

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
intake of the car and I just put it on

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.940 
intake of the car and I just put it on
I've<00:02:12.819> only<00:02:13.060> taken<00:02:13.209> one<00:02:13.390> ride<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.769> I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
I've only taken one ride in it and I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.250 
I've only taken one ride in it and I
tell<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.250> what<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.670> definitely<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:17.019> just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
tell you what it definitely it just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.839 
tell you what it definitely it just
feels<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.739> gives<00:02:17.950> my<00:02:18.069> gas<00:02:18.280> pedal<00:02:18.310> more

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
feels it gives my gas pedal more

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.990 
feels it gives my gas pedal more
pressure<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:20.319> just<00:02:20.650> feels<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.549> don't<00:02:21.790> have

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
pressure it just feels like I don't have

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.759 
pressure it just feels like I don't have
to<00:02:22.090> push<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.420> down<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.870> hard<00:02:23.049> for<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.590> go

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
to push it down so hard for it to go

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.930 
to push it down so hard for it to go
like<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.489> used<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:26.400> once<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.549> get<00:02:27.700> going

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
like I used to and once you get going

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.870 
like I used to and once you get going
down<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.510> down<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.989> highway<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.700> like

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
down the down the highway it's it's like

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.580 
down the down the highway it's it's like
having<00:02:31.209> cruise<00:02:31.450> control<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.049> mean<00:02:32.109> you<00:02:32.410> can

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
having cruise control I mean you can

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.059 
having cruise control I mean you can
keep<00:02:32.769> your<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.549> keep<00:02:33.579> your<00:02:33.880> speed<00:02:35.069> just

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
keep your you can keep your speed just

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.240 
keep your you can keep your speed just
barely<00:02:36.489> pushing<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.910> gas<00:02:37.120> down<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.980> anyways

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
barely pushing the gas down but anyways

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.150 
barely pushing the gas down but anyways
that's<00:02:39.430> why<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:41.230> my<00:02:41.349> new<00:02:41.470> setup<00:02:41.739> right<00:02:42.010> there

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
that's why it's my new setup right there

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.570 
that's why it's my new setup right there

to<00:02:52.680> two<00:02:53.680> hoses<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.250> easier<00:02:54.610> than<00:02:54.730> hooking<00:02:54.940> up<00:02:55.120> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
to two hoses is easier than hooking up a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.480 
to two hoses is easier than hooking up a
car<00:02:55.390> amplifier<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:57.670> worth<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:59.310> go<00:03:00.310> ahead

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
car amplifier and it's worth it go ahead

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.310 
car amplifier and it's worth it go ahead
and<00:03:00.580> fire<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.910> up<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.900> don't<00:03:05.080> have<00:03:05.200> an

and fire this up I just I don't have an

like that I've got a starship coil

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.240 
like that I've got a starship coil
running<00:03:22.060> like<00:03:22.210> you've<00:03:22.360> seen<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:24.070> a

running like you've seen it it's a
inline<00:03:24.880> fuse<00:03:25.180> from<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.070> alternator<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
inline fuse from the alternator to the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.280 
inline fuse from the alternator to the
inline<00:03:27.910> fuse<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.510> then<00:03:28.690> through<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.930> starship

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
inline fuse and then through a starship

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.840 
inline fuse and then through a starship
coil<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.800> back<00:03:30.490> into<00:03:30.820> this<00:03:31.080> right<00:03:32.080> there<00:03:32.850> the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
coil and back into this right there the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:52.900 
coil and back into this right there the
starship<00:03:34.240> club<00:03:34.420> does<00:03:34.660> get<00:03:34.840> hot<00:03:35.050> as<00:03:35.230> heck
