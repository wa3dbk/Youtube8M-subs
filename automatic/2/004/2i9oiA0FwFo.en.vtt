00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.540
 very good I am Libyan yoga as you see 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.860
 I know that he has been inactive for a few days 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.780
 the channel and it's good that I'm a student and 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.430
 I've had exams 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.840
 deliver jobs and the first thing is 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.039
 first but good do not worry 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.600
 because I already return to the activity of 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.490
 channel today as you are seeing in the 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.560
 Title Five tricks for photography 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.359
 urban and that is that you are several of you 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.789
 those who ask me day after day how 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.800
 improve in this type of photographs how 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.540
 be less shy like asking people 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.880
 of tough kind shape that pose for 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.950
 your photographs so today I'm going 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.200
 to give 5 tips that I have been 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.060
 useful first advice to works of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.680
 preproduction ie do not go to the site 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.020
 where you want to shoot with a 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.610
 blinds come a few days to andres and 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.440
 look a bit look for what kind of 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.360
 photographs wants to get to be able 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.310
 plan possible camera shots 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.680
 possible angulation is super important 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.300
 so you can see the light that there is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.100
 when you start in this type of 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.660
 Photographs I recommend that you go to 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 sites with a lot of people 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.680
 because because that can confuse you 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.750
 with a with a tourist who is doing 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.760
 your pictures and they will not look at you with 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.770
 You're not going to make bad gestures 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.690
 when they do the photography very much 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.040
 careful in this kind of sites about 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.020
 everything with your team so that you do not 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.790
 steal, take a good look at your backpack and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.710
 strap hooks to the neck for 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.940
 Do not steal your camera once 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.010
 you are progressing in this type of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.170
 photographs go to places that are a 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.970
 little more intimate to be able to obtain 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.320
 a more interesting photograph my 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.330
 second advice is that you work with 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.369
 average focal lengths if it can be 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.619
 pulling to short sure that many of 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.000
 you have zoom lenses I'm going to 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.530
 tell what I did when I started 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360
 do this kind of photography that sure 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.280
 that many of you then serve you 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.290
 know my experience I started doing 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.680
 this kind of pictures with about 600 of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.479
 and with 124 105 put on camera what 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.580
 that allowed me to have a small 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.979
 margin of this zoom not to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.750
 certain situations and what I 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.759
 I did the first day was to adjust my 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.050
 target to 150 and I put it as if 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.900
 I was working with a distance 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.590
 fixed focus I fixed it and it forced me 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.210
 to have to leave 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 forward based on what I 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.869
 I wanted to get and in this way 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 I had room to stay away from the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.709
 person because with a 105 mounted on 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.989
 about 600 of us are working with a 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.819
 180 more or less so this gave me 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.620
 margin to be able to be away from the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.090
 person does not lead with the mentality of 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.620
 that people were going to stop me and I was going to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.930
 say because I 've done the photo or if it's 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.549
 to bother no but this was not so 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.260
 that on the second day I was cutting 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.810
 a little the focal distance with which 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 worked until the days passed and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.129
 since I worked in angular I did not work with 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.660
 24 millimeters put in camera yes that's 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.250
 true that when you work with angular 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.349
 you are going to have to be much faster 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.150
 because you are going to have to take the camera 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.010
 in the waist as if you were walking 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.110
 calmly and the moment you see 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.390
 the photograph take you quickly to 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.470
 eye pum and shoot and keep walking like 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.079
 if nothing had happened so 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.360
 try to progress towards that kind of 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.010
 focal lengths because the truth is 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.989
 that is achieved in much more photographs 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.690
 interesting my third advice is that 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.950
 do an intensive of discretion and I 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.420
 truth is that I have had enough tricks 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.549
 I will share with you but 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.720
 this goes according to each person if 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.490
 someone is very shy and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.650
 and he gets nervous very easily 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.450
 Well surely you will have many more 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.580
 problems if you're a loose guy and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.050
 extroverted that surely it goes away 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.600
 to get out of the situation in a very 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.490
 agile what I did was always good 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.440
 first try to take the least 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.470
 possible equipment nothing flashes 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.880
 reflectors batteries grips nothing 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.740
 the more discreet your team is 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.190
 much better 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.690
 well what I was basically doing was 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.240
 when I shot the photographs 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.650
 then he changed to where he was 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.620
 framed and I pretended I was 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.080
 doing a photograph then to something else 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.000
 and nobody suspected and another thing that you 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.380
 I can recommend is to do as you 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.210
 you are touching your settings 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.950
 camera or you do not have it because to do 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.870
 the photograph and stay with the camera 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.170
 in the eye you know how to do it there and then 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.060
 quickly change and no longer is that in the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.250
 emirates tries to avoid contact 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.780
 visual with the person because when to you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.430
 someone looks at you you realize that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.670
 is watching you so try to 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.530
 avoid as much as you can 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.849
 establish a visual contact with the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.040
 person you want to make the photo 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.450
 because as you see them look at you the 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.430
 you have messed up and you are going to realize that 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.500
 you are going to make the photo to him try to be what 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.570
 more agile and fast possible my room 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.000
 advice is another intensive but in this 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.530
 case of empathy if the person has 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.270
 complied and has realized that the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.669
 I stalk the photograph the do not worry 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.350
 always smile he tries to be the most 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.600
 kind and respectful with which you can 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.160
 prepare a speech because all the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.200
 people who catch you are going to ask you what 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.120
 same because you have made the photograph 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.710
 so you have done the photograph if 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.540
 you're going to post it somewhere if it's 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.880
 a school job if you're going to 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.340
 expose somewhere so be prepared 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.960
 a speech and the answers to those 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.720
 questions because they will always be the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.639
 same in another advice that I can give you 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.190
 is that if he asks you to erase the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.320
 photographs try to be a bit agile 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.450
 I remember once a man told me 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.400
 asked him to erase the photographs and 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.229
 gave the trash can cancel trash 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.479
 cancel because I did several and gave 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.860
 trash cancel then the lord will 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.840
 I was thinking that I was giving it to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.720
 cancel was deleting the photo but not 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.610
 it's like this you have to give it to erase erase 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.490
 then try to play a little bit with 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.560
 I do not know with that picaresque not what you 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.900
 I say but if it is exposed then baroque and 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.880
 asks us to elaborate what work 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.980
 to erase it, you put us in no mess because 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.780
 will take us nowhere and very 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.640
 probably not the best photograph 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.230
 of your life so if in the end the 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.730
 thing gets complicated and asks you to erase it 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.740
 after erasing my fifth and last 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.690
 advice is that you start with people 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.720
 photographed what do I mean by this 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.790
 then to typical typical human statues 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.070
 that dancers are juggling 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.660
 acrobats who are on the street starts 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.860
 with these people because it is usually 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.620
 used to being photographed 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.020
 take 10 euros change them to coins and 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.669
 Take yourself because the truth is that no 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.009
 They are usually very comfortable if they do 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.479
 the photographs for free as well 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.460
 that invests ten euros in your 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.500
 photographs change that currency if you 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.729
 You give a small tip but you do not 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.889
 be pretty cool because you have to 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.990
 adjust values ​​very quickly 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.449
 for example with the dancers for 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.789
 be able to freeze or capture your movement 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.289
 with the acrobats these who are with the 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.080
 fire then to get it to look 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.669
 perfectly fire so my last 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.229
 advice would be if you start with 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.330
 this kind of people the latest and greatest 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.069
 important for this type of photographs 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.770
 is that he is always respectful of the 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.539
 people I always try to treat the 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.250
 others as I would like to be treated 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.319
 I was a person who makes me a 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.449
 photography and good in a kind way 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.949
 nice and smile teaches me the 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.900
 photograph and tell me how it looks is for 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.000
 my little portfolio that I'm doing 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.979
 because I'm a photographer and I want to dedicate myself 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.069
 to this, I do not tell you to erase it 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.479
 but if there comes a quinqui and tells me going 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.340
 which in fact you have not photography 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.190
 then of drawings and post erase them 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.810
 and that clears it in front of me so that 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.970
 It is super important that you be kind and 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.260
 respectful with people so up 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.000
 here today's video I hope that I have 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.100
 liked it if it is so do not forget to leave your me
