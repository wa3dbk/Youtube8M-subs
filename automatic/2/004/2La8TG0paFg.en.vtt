00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.330
 good my friends how are we 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.050
 posterior and lower limb part 7 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.450
 it takes 75 or so does a lot of 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.130
 times you tried to record this but as 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.630
 I mentioned the phone grabs me all or 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.960
 I choked or I do not know I get confused 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.760
 concentration let's see greetings 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.920
 for roberto hernÃ¡ndez from the university 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.730
 of guadalajara in mexico and for all the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.289
 search for venezuela huge hugs 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.809
 for all 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.550
 lukewarm we had seen in the part 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.300
 anterior of the tibia now let's the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.219
 back 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.930
 but to see the back of the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.860
 warm it is necessary to remember what muscles 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.480
 we have on the back face of the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.420
 leg then little square reminder 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.269
 of the posterior group of the leg these 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.089
 muscles are arranged in two planes 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.460
 a deep plane and a superficial degree 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.769
 the provincial product has the triceps 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.159
 sural that is formed by the soleus and 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.909
 the two twins and the slim pose 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.030
 while in the deep plane 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.149
 we have four muscles that are up 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.440
 from all the public and down inside 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:18.420
 out the common flexor of the fingers 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.890
 tibial posterior and on one's own finger 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.290
 thick 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.810
 for this deep plane there is a mood 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.729
 technology that is swan fringe 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.180
 to see how is this seems complicated 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 but not if you learn if you understand it 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.020
 it's worth a lot of pictures explains thorium 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.609
 up the pop lithium 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.460
 down from inside to outside fringe that 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:46.399
 common selection ti that is tibial 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.580
 back and flex that is own traction 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.760
 of the finger euros 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.180
 these muscles are going to insert the most 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.690
 internal in the bone inside only 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.330
 which is the tibia the most external only in 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.040
 the outside bone that is the fibula and the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.770
 from the middle neither inside nor outside 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 inserted in both in the tibia and the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.869
 fibula or that in the tibia is going to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.410
 insert the lithium pop in the common sensor 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.990
 of the fingers and the posterior tibial this 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.850
 then they cross but it does not matter because 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.240
 we're just going to see when we see muscle 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.000
 Now I'm going to rear view 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.030
 We expand a little Mr. Director is a 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.290
 what level it is the first thing that strikes us 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.530
 attention of the back face of the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.900
 lukewarm is this line oblique line 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.230
 oblique of the tibia that will insert the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.380
 soleus muscle that is always asked 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.450
 above a low triangular area 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.630
 superior that will insert the muscle 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.660
 popliteus and below what remains of the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.390
 corporate already here this level in the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.310
 external curiosity this is always 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.220
 right this is internal this is external 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.690
 and external laterality is inserted the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.420
 biceps biceps crural ocular on the face 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.570
 posterior of the tibia below the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.230
 oblique line of the soleus is going to be inserted 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:17.700
 well inwards the fringe pop fringe the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.880
 common flexor of the fringe and tibial fingers 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.630
 later the neuro flexor itself that's not 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.350
 will be inserted sir class 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.780
 it was understood perfect but as we want 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.170
 spin a little thinner let's see 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:38.240
 that in the internal university from behind 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:42.290
 the direct tendon of the 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.410
 semimembranous here we have the biceps and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.500
 we see that in the biceps that boludo the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.090
 I fibred the peroneal bone fibula that in 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.880
 the entire external face of the fibula is 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.830
 insert the long lateral peroneus that 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.810
 they remember the previous video came 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.440
 to the tibia outside the tuber 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.020
 of being of the long lateral peroneus the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.120
 soleus is inserted in all 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.970
 this line but also does it in the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.400
 head of the fibula solio and finally 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.320
 comes down the biceps that is inserted 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.940
 mainly in the styloid polis of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.670
 the head of fibula but that also 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.930
 send a fascicle to the tibia and here 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.760
 we have the three muscles 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.180
 insert into the head of the fibula that of 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.640
 step I tell you biceps soleus and peroneus 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.470
 long side and remember is that the 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.080
 biceps and the long lateral pioneer 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.050
 fibers are also sent 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.819
 of insertion to the internal curiosity of 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.090
 the tibia in front of the peroneus lateral 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:41.220
 long and behind the biceps the soleus 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.100
 obviously on the crest of the sun 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.080
 Lukewarm seen from above at his extremity 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.700
 proximal view from above that is what 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.570
 that catches our attention the two 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.610
 tibial plateaus or glenoid cavity or 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.830
 tibia dishes that are 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.650
 slightly concave coated with 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.720
 fiber or articular cartilage and that will 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.060
 receive the condyles of the two 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.850
 surfaces the internal one has a diameter 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.240
 anterior anteroposterior since the condyle 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.820
 internal is more finite and more elongated 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.560
 so that there is a perfect uptake of a 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.230
 turn and articulate we have the 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.390
 Meniscus inter ticular is an internal 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.460
 that has the form of a letter c and an external one 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.850
 which has a letter shape is well closed 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.380
 so we say that they are shaped like 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.760
 internal way of being external in form 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.860
 of voice but that we will see later 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.930
 when we see the articulation part 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.940
 of the knee in the middle of the two 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.580
 cavities and not ideas the thorn of the 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.470
 warm ahead pre surfaces 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.930
 spinoza where the ligament is inserted 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.610
 previous crossed that will go to the 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.980
 inter face with dida of the external condyle 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.540
 and behind the insertion or 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.430
 retro surface where espinoza 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.900
 insert the posterior cruciate ligament 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.440
 that from there will go to the face inter 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.710
 concilia of the internal condyle very well 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:01.690
 What's this realize peroneal 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.860
 long side and this the biceps and that's the 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.069
 soleus 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.979
 very good lower extremity of the tibia 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.400
 front view and back view this 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.009
 it is internal 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.160
 and forgiveness is a previous view this 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.930
 it is external and this is internal the extreme 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.570
 figurative is shaped like a pyramid of 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.620
 quadrangular bases and be truncated the 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.870
 previous face does not have any 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.570
 particularity except that in its angle 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.150
 Internal below presents a thorn that 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.190
 termed malleolus tibialis or malleolus 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.539
 of the ankle and will insert the 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.030
 internal lateral ligament of the 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.789
 ankle joint face 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.669
 posterior presents three channels where 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:43.710
 are going to pass an internal one this is the 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.550
 posterior face of distal extremity already 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.250
 tibia 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.710
 this is internal this is external ones 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.120
 good internal where the tibial passes 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.699
 previous 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.040
 later forgiveness the tibial tendon 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.290
 later a medium one where the 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.669
 Flexor tendon of the fingers and 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.820
 one more external where three pass 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.830
 where the thickness of the thickness 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.110
 lastly the lower face is going to 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.330
 correspond to the trochlea that it has in 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.540
 the upper face the calcaneus for 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.919
 pro clear articulation of this the 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.960
 ankle or partial warm good my friends 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:21.180
 until here we arrive with lukewarm hope that 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.560
 they liked success is for the fans 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.530
 but obviously this is for the fans 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:30.680
 people a hug for donÃ©s by the 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.680
 furcios and we are seeing ciao
