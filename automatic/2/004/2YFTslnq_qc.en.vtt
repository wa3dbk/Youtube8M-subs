videos so without further ado let's

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.890 
videos so without further ado let's
begin

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.950 

the<00:00:09.900> Golden<00:00:10.440> Rule<00:00:10.640> tutor<00:00:11.640> diving<00:00:12.150> something<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
the Golden Rule tutor diving something I

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.210 
the Golden Rule tutor diving something I
generally<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.470> to<00:00:13.530> follow<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
generally like to follow is the

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.820 
generally like to follow is the
three-second<00:00:15.090> rule<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.990> can't<00:00:16.260> catch<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
three-second rule if I can't catch up to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.740 
three-second rule if I can't catch up to
people<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.130> kill<00:00:17.670> someone<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.060> three<00:00:18.360> seconds

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
people and kill someone in three seconds

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.109 
people and kill someone in three seconds
then<00:00:19.020> I'll<00:00:19.230> stop<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.740> back<00:00:19.920> off<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.430> these

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
then I'll stop and back off in these

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.089 
then I'll stop and back off in these
next<00:00:21.360> few<00:00:21.510> clips<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.200> this<00:00:22.349> rule<00:00:22.650> holding

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
next few clips we see this rule holding

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.909 
next few clips we see this rule holding
true<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.610> each<00:00:23.730> situation<00:00:24.169> first<00:00:25.169> off<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.770> have

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
true in each situation first off we have

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.830 
true in each situation first off we have
Wukong<00:00:26.340> diving<00:00:26.849> he<00:00:27.150> certainly<00:00:27.450> has<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
Wukong diving he certainly has the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.069 
Wukong diving he certainly has the
damage<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.770> finish<00:00:29.040> my<00:00:29.369> zen<00:00:29.700> gel<00:00:30.029> off<00:00:30.239> but<00:00:30.989> he

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
damage to finish my zen gel off but he

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.290 
damage to finish my zen gel off but he
can't<00:00:31.290> catch<00:00:31.529> me<00:00:31.710> within<00:00:31.890> three<00:00:32.189> seconds<00:00:32.579> his

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
can't catch me within three seconds his

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
can't catch me within three seconds his
flash<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.870> cooldown<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.040> does<00:00:35.160> his<00:00:35.399> e

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
flash is on cooldown and so does his e

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
flash is on cooldown and so does his e
it<00:00:36.390> makes<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.720> right<00:00:36.870> decision<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.410> backs

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it makes the right decision and backs

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.829 
it makes the right decision and backs
off<00:00:37.890> avoiding<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.670> death<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> turret

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.349 

next<00:00:47.839> up<00:00:47.989> we<00:00:48.170> have<00:00:48.199> fewer<00:00:48.679> who<00:00:48.980> dives<00:00:49.309> me<00:00:49.670> she

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
next up we have fewer who dives me she

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.270 
next up we have fewer who dives me she
certainly<00:00:50.570> has<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:50.989> damage<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.500> kill<00:00:51.769> me<00:00:51.920> but

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
certainly has the damage to kill me but

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.340 
certainly has the damage to kill me but
she<00:00:52.460> can't<00:00:52.760> catch<00:00:53.089> me<00:00:53.359> in<00:00:53.510> less<00:00:53.750> than<00:00:53.929> three

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
she can't catch me in less than three

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.410 
she can't catch me in less than three
seconds<00:00:54.829> instead<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.789> backing<00:00:55.969> off<00:00:56.269> she

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
seconds instead of backing off she

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.450 
seconds instead of backing off she
chooses<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:56.989> chase<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.530> eventually<00:00:58.219> meets

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
chooses the chase and eventually meets

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.779 
chooses the chase and eventually meets
her<00:00:58.670> doom<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.449> turret<00:00:59.809> in<00:01:00.789> another

her doom to the turret in another

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this tip is to show you how important

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
this tip is to show you how important
mana<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.870> don't<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.140> enough<00:01:28.350> mana

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
mana is if you don't have enough mana

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
mana is if you don't have enough mana
when<00:01:28.800> then<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.550> basically<00:01:29.670> completely

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
when then you're basically completely

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
when then you're basically completely
reliant<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.050> auto<00:01:31.350> attacks<00:01:31.770> making<00:01:32.280> you
