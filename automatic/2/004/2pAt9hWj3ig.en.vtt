thinking it might be but I'm trying to

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.380 
thinking it might be but I'm trying to
trying<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.709> be<00:03:12.100> optimistic<00:03:12.430> about<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.150> but

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
trying to be optimistic about it but

slightly memorable then we had a TV spot
for<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.739> big<00:03:20.890> one<00:03:21.070> captain<00:03:21.519> america<00:03:22.090> which<00:03:22.600> i

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
for a big one captain america which i

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840 
for a big one captain america which i

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
this film is improving tremendously on

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.870 
this film is improving tremendously on
the<00:03:31.120> foundation<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> predecessor<00:03:33.190> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the foundation that the predecessor you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.699 
the foundation that the predecessor you
know<00:03:34.000> set<00:03:34.480> up<00:03:34.570> for<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.109> i<00:03:35.200> really<00:03:35.410> like<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
know set up for it and i really like the

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.050 
know set up for it and i really like the
story<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.130> time<00:03:36.190> around<00:03:36.459> i<00:03:36.640> really<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
story this time around i really like the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.819 
story this time around i really like the
whole<00:03:37.209> concept<00:03:37.660> behind<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.380> winter<00:03:38.620> soldier

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
whole concept behind the winter soldier

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.410 
whole concept behind the winter soldier
especially<00:03:39.549> since<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.790> know<00:03:39.850> who<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.209> winter

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
especially since I know who the winter

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.990 
especially since I know who the winter
soldier<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.109> true<00:03:41.320> identity<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:42.850> think

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
soldier is is true identity and I think

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.069 
soldier is is true identity and I think
it's<00:03:43.090> going<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.239> make<00:03:43.359> first<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.750> great

see<00:03:58.600> this<00:03:58.630> movie<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.620> think<00:03:59.829> that<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.040> is

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
see this movie and I think that this is

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.490 
see this movie and I think that this is
going<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.430> follow<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:00.970> line<00:04:01.000> with<00:04:01.390> Thor<00:04:02.049> 2<00:04:02.290> and

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
going to follow in line with Thor 2 and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.470 
going to follow in line with Thor 2 and
then<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:02.829> improves<00:04:03.430> upon<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:04.090> original

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
then it just improves upon the original

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.059 
then it just improves upon the original
in<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.660> lot<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:04.930> ways<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:05.769> makes<00:04:05.980> her

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
in a lot of ways and just makes her

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.710 
in a lot of ways and just makes her
really<00:04:06.220> satisfying<00:04:06.760> sequel<00:04:07.120> I'm<00:04:07.180> hoping<00:04:07.540> that

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
really satisfying sequel I'm hoping that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.569 
really satisfying sequel I'm hoping that
it<00:04:07.930> can<00:04:08.049> fall<00:04:08.319> in<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.650> same<00:04:08.829> vein<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.130> think<00:04:09.489> it

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
it can fall in the same vein I think it

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.120 
it can fall in the same vein I think it
is<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.819> looks<00:04:09.970> really<00:04:10.389> fantastic<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.829> action

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
looks great and it's just going to be

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.270

both<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.880> which<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.180> me<00:04:27.330> we're<00:04:27.540> just

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
both of which to me we're just

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.390 
both of which to me we're just
underwhelming<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.590> don't<00:04:28.980> know<00:04:29.040> what<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
underwhelming I don't know what it is

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400 
underwhelming I don't know what it is
but<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.730> more<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:29.910> see<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.389> movie<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.990> less<00:04:31.200> I

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
but the more I see this movie the less I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.020 
but the more I see this movie the less I
want<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.740> go<00:04:31.830> out<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.160> see<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.550> thing<00:04:32.820> it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
want to go out and see this thing it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.730 
want to go out and see this thing it
just<00:04:33.300> looks<00:04:33.540> like<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.690> mess<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:34.290> me<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.620> there's

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
just looks like a mess to me and there's

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.840 
just looks like a mess to me and there's
just<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:34.980> many<00:04:35.070> villains<00:04:35.490> fooling<00:04:35.760> around

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
just so many villains fooling around

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.060 
just so many villains fooling around
then<00:04:36.150> he<00:04:36.240> got<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.900> Sinister<00:04:37.260> Six<00:04:37.290> being<00:04:37.800> set

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
then he got the Sinister Six being set

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.129 
then he got the Sinister Six being set
up<00:04:38.100> I<00:04:38.280> think<00:04:38.340> it's<00:04:39.030> just<00:04:39.120> as<00:04:39.419> just<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:39.810> much<00:04:39.960> as

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
up I think it's just as just so much as

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.690 
up I think it's just as just so much as
going<00:04:40.410> on<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:40.770> overwhelming<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.370> special

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
going on it's overwhelming the special

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.909 
going on it's overwhelming the special
effects<00:04:42.000> kind<00:04:42.180> of<00:04:42.300> look<00:04:42.389> cartoony<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.139> mean<00:04:43.620> the

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
effects kind of look cartoony I mean the

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.620 
effects kind of look cartoony I mean the
chimney<00:04:44.490> part<00:04:44.760> at<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.000> end<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.300> this<00:04:45.389> thing

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
chimney part at the end of this thing

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.060 
chimney part at the end of this thing
got<00:04:45.810> we<00:04:46.020> gotta<00:04:46.169> wipe<00:04:46.380> out<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.650> me<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.860> really

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
got we gotta wipe out of me and I really

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.650 
got we gotta wipe out of me and I really
do<00:04:47.340> think<00:04:47.490> Andrew<00:04:47.790> Garfield<00:04:48.180> makes<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.450> great

do think Andrew Garfield makes a great
Peter<00:04:48.930> Parker<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:49.530> I'm<00:04:49.650> spider-man<00:04:49.889> but<00:04:50.340> I

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
Peter Parker so I'm spider-man but I

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
don't know it just does not look very

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.800 
don't know it just does not look very
good<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.770> me<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:52.980> I'm<00:04:53.130> really<00:04:53.810> really

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
good to me and I'm really really

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.690 
good to me and I'm really really
pessimistic<00:04:54.990> about<00:04:55.470> this<00:04:55.800> film<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.520> I

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
pessimistic about this film I just I

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.760 
pessimistic about this film I just I
just<00:04:57.120> looks<00:04:57.510> too<00:04:57.630> crazy<00:04:58.140> for<00:04:58.260> me<00:04:58.440> just<00:04:58.650> looks

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
just looks too crazy for me just looks

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.960 
just looks too crazy for me just looks
like<00:04:58.860> it's<00:04:58.950> gonna<00:04:59.010> be<00:04:59.130> all<00:04:59.310> over<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.760> place

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
like it's gonna be all over the place

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.210 
like it's gonna be all over the place
but<00:05:00.419> I'm<00:05:00.570> hoping<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:00.930> Marc<00:05:01.290> Webb<00:05:01.530> lauren

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
