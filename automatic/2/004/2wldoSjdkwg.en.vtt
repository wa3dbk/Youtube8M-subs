00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.639
 we have a lot of good fighters 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:24.960
 it's claude 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.910
 dion shed on delivery he expected to meet panic who will all be then 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.910
 deposited with more than 40 distribution points 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.200
 2 are the vegetables from the gardens of cocagne the first initiative 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.530
 contract farming anderson 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.360
 and sells products directly from producers to consumers 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.220
 without intermediary on the basis of a contract 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.130
 the consumer is committed to buying products for a year eric she is 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 paid for advanced 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.270
 one of them 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.200
 at the beginning of the adventure of the gardens of cocagne it is on several plots 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 private that gardeners this are activate them 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 some worries and the trick was played 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.900
 you are the first year this vine in more than 7'40 people crying in 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.150
 seven meetings pitch-terron 700 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.930
 she 150 people pretty quickly it lasted five hours 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.710
 I do not think in five or six heavenly years to 150 operators and then 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 after three days ki-moon increased the number 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.270
 for several reasons have made one of the reasons it's done 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.280
 compromised and no longer had vegetables 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.650
 but it was also necessary that the most in fact what do you want to have 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.780
 wages still more consistent than we really left 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.480
 puts all its debt in bubbles 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.820
 we thought the christ appeal the important thing is that it is running after having 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.270
 tumbled as we could after this half-time 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.990
 here we are we had to change 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.549
 and then there wages increase wages have increased the price of parks 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.900
 where you need the number of people 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.259
 to arrive I think in 2004 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.289
 hahaha 400 actors of 120 actors 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.209
 gradually the system of gardens of coagne inspired startup 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.529
 other projects in switzerland and france 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.219
 this old catania to move in her twenties where she would have liked 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.219
 continue to receive each week his basket of vegetables 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.150
 a few years later irony of fate this year which 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.420
 once reconverted to tomme d'alpage inspired his entourage to make of 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.420
 local contract farming 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.029
 but I spoke a lot with her 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.929
 startup in particular and that's what pushed the ministry had done 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.249
 a mountain is a variety of humanity 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.750
 and here is lawyer 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.229
 welcome 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.679
 a leap forward the idea of ​​giving time to create an association like 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:03.319
 it 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.359
 who addressed to his eyes the flesh of the market gardener at dinner 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.449
 look at sector is ranked but the three steps created 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.549
 Tehran created a currency war there are a number of 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 provinces that departed this week's warranty 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.169
 still their meat momentum so for me the fact of having 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.329
 customer networks if it's important because it's people who want to 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.369
 to have the right meat site 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.879
 and we also have contacts with people talking about it as if it's just the 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.349
 beginning 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.499
 small flaws are the cheeses at the specific market and people 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.389
 with the nerves of the popo changes if the expulsion of people 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.249
 in stores it's not possible in the stores can not explain to 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.249
 people why can not be raised a little different 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.900
 that last week for example the fact of taking place the contracts the people 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.579
 can come here they feel the afp closest allies they 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.579
 understand what this goat after-game 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.969
 between 2003 and 2005 the supermarket 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.190
 decided to reduce the middlemen 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.190
 hero centralises all deliveries from German-speaking Switzerland 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.629
 this restructuring pushed some market gardeners to pass but also 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.979
 for direct sales on the markets then before contractual 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.569
 we could have continued to deliver 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.949
 merpins to intermediates 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.970
 and as the costs of delivery place disks are at our expense 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.759
 it means that we are not even on an equal footing with producers 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.759
 he is the man who are next to the central 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.719
 because they're going to be the tractors delivering their salads 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.550
 and me for a pallet of salads that goes the balm costing 300 t this offer 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.919
 the europride the salad that is paid by the middlemen who deliver to them 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.949
 distribution 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:47.900
 we lose 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.900
 these scenes just not possible 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.069
 these market gardeners had developed at the time one of the specialties of 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.289
 tomatoes for the supermarket 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.099
 these varieties can only be transported on short 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.919
 distances and are sold at a high price 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.509
 today she also throws herself directly into the baskets of 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.039
 consumers 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.569
 instead of having a big client 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.199
 the redhead of big clio of who 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.800
 who can decide overnight or from one season to the next crying need 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.669
 from U.S 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.009
 packaging 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.879
 already 150 nairas by his art organizes in year 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.879
 the era of local networks in question by many 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.749
 it already existed but here I think it would have been difficult to 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.749
 develop 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.180
 for today so I was helped by his bosses 6-4 at the end 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.820
 % applied want to see things differently way of my life is 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.400
 really why not I try to develop a network to work 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.619
 closer 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.789
 the closest to the more areas to offer this product today 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.509
 applicable to beards because working products that ensues 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:05.119
 fear 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.099
 it's very little for an elite 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.029
 who can afford a tomato said fred kilos 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.339
 so bet does not seem to be won because 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.339
 here are his own luxury demons 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.480
 thomas and antoine conflicts part of the fourteen producers to do it 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:26.319
 turn m 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.189
 a cooperative specializing in the sale of custodial products 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.710
 in 2007 the two brothers also started to do more than 

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.709
 cereals weekly vegetable baskets 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.270
 we need agriculture today 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.080
 an activity 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.449
 for 100 th 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.270
 that can allow from January 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.490
 it's actually stopping completely the reverse agriculture disappears from 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.080
 people with the envy of reading without a head 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.219
 ap 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.320
 without hiding his 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.270
 how to make it a job like any other where people 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.600
 can live and then work hours now many times by 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.930
 the past day and night 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.520
 I started this thinking with the software to do for the rep the 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.479
 neighborhood as a member of the office 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.069
 and then we tried two to start this cereals level refurbishment 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.669
 and currently lavalas we stopped seven say good level of a 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.430
 acres of cereals we wanted 5000 francs 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.240
 the income ofsp 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.899
 percent for the title 

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.259
 step by step his wife must know today so that a farmer can 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.779
 to guard against it and its common hours and stories mechanical and 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.179
 roads for one hectare fir so I also said to continue to display at 

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:34.819
 this to make a very close bond to the surface the carrots on the surface 

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:38.369
 for his competitor harvested such quantity 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.929
 the kilo of carrots it was the price by the composer his job demand 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.589
 bringing together producers and consumers is not new 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.590
 already in the 1980s producers tired of bowing to 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.249
 growing demands of the big distribution they began to make 

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:03.699
 from direct selling before coming together in 1920 nantes 7 to form 

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:04.780
 peasant markets
