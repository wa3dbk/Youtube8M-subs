like pretty darn good advice but that's

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.670 
like pretty darn good advice but that's
kind<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.210> little<00:01:07.800> little<00:01:08.800> note<00:01:09.250> there<00:01:10.500> hmm<00:01:11.590> I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
kind of a little little note there hmm I

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
kind of a little little note there hmm I
could<00:01:12.369> see<00:01:12.610> how<00:01:12.850> someone<00:01:13.180> would<00:01:13.330> miss<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
could see how someone would miss that so

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.050 
could see how someone would miss that so
yeah<00:01:16.509> there<00:01:16.929> are<00:01:17.110> books<00:01:17.590> scattered<00:01:17.979> about<00:01:18.550> a

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
yeah there are books scattered about a

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.950 
yeah there are books scattered about a
dead<00:01:19.990> horse<00:01:21.360> even<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.689> chest<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.750> back

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
dead horse even a chest and in the back

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.520 
dead horse even a chest and in the back
there<00:01:26.290> -<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.530> think<00:01:26.650> there's<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.130> pouch<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
there - I think there's a pouch and that

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.520 
there - I think there's a pouch and that
would<00:01:29.710> be<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.950> dead<00:01:30.220> Khajiit<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.960> know<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
would be a dead Khajiit you know the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.520 
would be a dead Khajiit you know the
joke<00:01:32.799> writes<00:01:33.220> itself<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.869> not<00:01:35.110> my<00:01:35.320> bad

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
joke writes itself so it's not my bad

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.999 
joke writes itself so it's not my bad
joke

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
joke

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.990 
joke
it<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.460> Bethesda's<00:01:37.270> bad<00:01:37.509> joke<00:01:37.780> but<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.790> know

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
it is Bethesda's bad joke but you know

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.789 
it is Bethesda's bad joke but you know
they<00:01:40.180> might<00:01:40.360> not<00:01:40.570> have<00:01:40.630> Giants<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.470> elsewhere

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
they might not have Giants and elsewhere

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.399 
they might not have Giants and elsewhere
so<00:01:42.189> I<00:01:42.220> could<00:01:42.490> see<00:01:42.729> how<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.600> know<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:44.140> would<00:01:44.259> be

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
so I could see how you know it would be

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.289 
so I could see how you know it would be
yes

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
yes

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.960 
yes
so<00:01:47.200> Giants<00:01:47.770> are<00:01:47.860> very<00:01:48.009> dangerous<00:01:48.220> but<00:01:48.759> they<00:01:48.909> do

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
so Giants are very dangerous but they do

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.940 
so Giants are very dangerous but they do
have<00:01:49.240> some<00:01:49.479> cool<00:01:49.720> stuff<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:50.320> their<00:01:50.500> camps

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950

they've<00:01:51.100> got<00:01:51.310> treasure<00:01:51.670> they've<00:01:52.180> got

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
they've got treasure they've got

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.580 
they've got treasure they've got
mammoths<00:01:53.229> cheese<00:01:54.780> they<00:01:55.780> generally<00:01:56.320> have

mammoths cheese they generally have

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.200
