"Fashion Court" by Joanna Horodyńska - book launch event

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:33.700
Hi dears, we are on Joanna Horodyńska's, a Polish stylist and model, book launch event. "Fashion Court". I'm really excited as I've already told you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:43.700
on Facebook, I got my own 2 pages in the book, in its “It Girls” chapter, namely fashion trendsetters. It really is an honor, especially that I really

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:54.700
value her style and she's really edgy herself, she always does what she feels like doing. As I'm the only Polish blogger mentioned in the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.700
book, the honor is even bigger. It's really nice, as being original has been appreciated in its fashion sense.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.700
I'd like to congratulate you on having your book published once again and I'd like to ask to sum up what style is for you and how

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.700
different it is from fashion? J.H: Fashion can deceive us and style never will, it's something that we have inside of us. Fashion can change and our style stays,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:43.700
 using some elements of fashion. So I think that fashion is a bit deceiving and style is true and real and that's how I'd like to approach the matter and that's what I try to prove in my book.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.700
Me: And what did you find hard while editing the book? J.H: The content-related knowledge, when I had to give something a lot of thought

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.200
to be sure that it was “it”. I also wanted the vocabulary to be sophisticated. And besides from tips, I wanted the books to contain some

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:13.200
knowledge as well. And that was the hardest part, as I wanted something more. I'm currently working on a new project, about stars' style

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:23.200
and a bit about living in fashion. This fashion craziness.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.200
Me: I know that we always remember the teachers that are strict, they get to us more. And I think that's the case with your book.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:41.200
J.H.: I'd really like it to be that way. And the thing that so many people turned up here today is fantastic. Thank you!

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:02.200
I'm gonna review the book in a more complex way, in a separate post, and now I'd like to thank Joanna, whom I really admire, for honoring me in this way.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:15.200
I think that colorful birds and avant-garde people are gonna be appreciated more often, in Poland as well. Kisses!

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.200
