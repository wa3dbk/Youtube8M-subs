00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.319 
like using it that way too terribly much
just<00:01:58.359> because<00:01:58.749> it's<00:01:59.679> it's<00:02:00.609> very<00:02:00.700> predictable

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
just because it's it's very predictable

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.879

really<00:02:01.630> if<00:02:01.749> you<00:02:01.899> start<00:02:02.170> using<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:02.499> like<00:02:02.649> that

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
really if you start using it like that

check him out he is very very good at
parrying<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.000> well<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.800> wasn't<00:02:21.100> really

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
parrying and well it wasn't really

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.680 
parrying and well it wasn't really
working<00:02:21.550> out<00:02:21.760> well<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.030> my<00:02:22.120> favor<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.600> we'll

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
working out well in my favor and we'll

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.010 
working out well in my favor and we'll
just<00:02:22.810> leave<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.050> at<00:02:23.200> that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
just leave it at that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.830 
just leave it at that
I<00:02:24.110> figured<00:02:24.920> going<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.390> know<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> more

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
I figured going you know a more

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.480 
I figured going you know a more
traditional<00:02:27.050> approach<00:02:27.410> would<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:27.920> better<00:02:28.160> and

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
traditional approach would be better and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.620 
traditional approach would be better and
it<00:02:29.150> was<00:02:29.330> definitely<00:02:30.130> now<00:02:31.130> with<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.090> weapon<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
it was definitely now with this weapon I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.480 
it was definitely now with this weapon I
would<00:02:33.050> have<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.260> say<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.770> biggest<00:02:33.980> pro

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
would have to say that the biggest pro

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.210 
would have to say that the biggest pro
of<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.940> weapon<00:02:35.240> would<00:02:35.780> probably<00:02:36.380> be<00:02:36.650> when

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
of the weapon would probably be when

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.430 
of the weapon would probably be when
power<00:02:37.520> stance<00:02:37.910> how<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.630> gains<00:02:38.930> such<00:02:39.260> an

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
power stance how it gains such an

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.410 
power stance how it gains such an
incredible<00:02:39.920> speed<00:02:40.190> boost<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:40.640> how<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.120> can<00:02:41.300> be

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
incredible speed boost and how it can be

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.030 
incredible speed boost and how it can be
used<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:41.720> combo<00:02:42.080> very<00:02:42.350> well<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.860> other

move<00:03:13.970> set<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.330> do<00:03:14.390> enjoy<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.050> move<00:03:15.230> set<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.680> it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
move set I do enjoy the move set of it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.950 
move set I do enjoy the move set of it
when<00:03:16.100> one-handed<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.120> two-handed<00:03:17.540> move<00:03:17.690> set

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
when one-handed the two-handed move set

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.390 
when one-handed the two-handed move set
it<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.760> uh<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.040> little<00:03:22.280> bit

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
it it's uh it's a little bit

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.030 
it it's uh it's a little bit
disappointing<00:03:22.910> it's<00:03:23.570> short<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.710> would<00:03:24.920> be

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
disappointing it's short that would be

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.590 
disappointing it's short that would be
the<00:03:25.190> biggest<00:03:25.370> con<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.090> weapon<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.570> is

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
the biggest con of this weapon it is

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.250 
the biggest con of this weapon it is
fairly<00:03:27.260> short<00:03:27.820> but<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:28.880> being<00:03:29.390> said<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.080> can

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
fairly short but that being said you can

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.290 
fairly short but that being said you can
deal<00:03:30.709> with<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.850> be<00:03:32.000> somewhat

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
deal with it you have to be somewhat

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.760 
deal with it you have to be somewhat
close<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.750> person<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.200> order<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.470> hit<00:03:33.620> them

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
close to the person in order to hit them

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.220 
close to the person in order to hit them
due<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.430> length<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.330> it's<00:03:35.959> not<00:03:36.200> a

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
due to the length of it and it's not a

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.900 
due to the length of it and it's not a
horrible<00:03:36.680> thing<00:03:36.800> especially<00:03:37.459> if<00:03:37.550> you<00:03:37.670> are

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
horrible thing especially if you are

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.090 
horrible thing especially if you are
powers<00:03:38.420> dancing<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.680> when<00:03:39.830> you're<00:03:39.920> not

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
powers dancing it but when you're not

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100 
powers dancing it but when you're not
well<00:03:40.490> if<00:03:41.300> you're<00:03:41.510> fighting<00:03:41.660> someone<00:03:41.959> with<00:03:42.080> a

gonna<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.140> little<00:03:51.410> bit<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.740> difficulty

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
gonna have a little bit of difficulty

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.640 
gonna have a little bit of difficulty
fighting<00:03:52.610> them<00:03:52.910> but<00:03:53.690> as<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.140> said<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.500> is

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
fighting them but as I said it is

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.140 
fighting them but as I said it is
manageable<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.120> there's<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:57.640> another<00:03:58.640> huge

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
manageable so there's that another huge

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.480 
manageable so there's that another huge
con<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.810> this<00:04:00.110> weapon<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.590> would<00:04:01.070> definitely

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.430 
con of this weapon I would definitely
say<00:04:01.790> would<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.420> fact<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.780> when<00:04:02.990> you<00:04:03.110> do

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
say would be the fact that when you do

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.400 
say would be the fact that when you do
attack<00:04:03.740> with<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.070> yes<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.000> can<00:04:05.270> aim<00:04:05.600> manually

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
attack with it yes you can aim manually

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.070

with<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.740> left<00:04:07.160> thumbstick<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.930> can

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
with the left thumbstick but you can

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080 
with the left thumbstick but you can
only<00:04:09.200> do<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.770> first<00:04:09.920> swing<00:04:10.250> if<00:04:11.030> you

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
only do that on the first swing if you

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.150 
only do that on the first swing if you
continue<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.900> swing<00:04:12.230> more<00:04:12.470> than<00:04:12.650> once<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.040> are

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
continue to swing more than once you are

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160 
continue to swing more than once you are
locked<00:04:13.400> into<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.940> direction<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.600> unable<00:04:14.990> to

locked into the direction and unable to

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.710 
locked into the direction and unable to
turn<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.520> can<00:04:16.970> cause<00:04:17.150> quite<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.540> few

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
turn so that can cause quite a few

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.159 
turn so that can cause quite a few
problems<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.489> well<00:04:19.489> it's<00:04:20.330> gotten<00:04:20.810> me<00:04:20.989> killed

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
problems and well it's gotten me killed

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.050 
problems and well it's gotten me killed
numerous<00:04:21.799> times<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.250> rather<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.760> forbidden

son<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.540> didn't<00:04:23.900> actually<00:04:24.140> expect<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.830> equip

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.290 
son I didn't actually expect it to equip
me<00:04:25.310> but<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.090> what<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:28.090> due<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.120> the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
me but it is what it is so due to the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.670 
me but it is what it is so due to the
fact<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.630> you<00:04:29.900> are<00:04:30.080> locked<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.530> two

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
fact that you are locked in two

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.130 
fact that you are locked in two
directions<00:04:30.800> after<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.940> swing<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.750> can't

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
directions after you swing and can't

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.050 
directions after you swing and can't
sort<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.470> turn<00:04:33.710> with<00:04:33.919> your<00:04:34.100> opponent<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.820> can

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
sort of turn with your opponent that can

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.250 
sort of turn with your opponent that can
leave<00:04:35.540> you

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
leave you

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.180 
leave you
very<00:04:36.740> vulnerable<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.780> well<00:04:39.040> considering<00:04:40.040> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
very vulnerable and well considering the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.370 
very vulnerable and well considering the
slow<00:04:40.400> swing<00:04:40.730> speed<00:04:41.030> which<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.360> also<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.720> decent

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
slow swing speed which is also a decent

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.070 
slow swing speed which is also a decent
kind<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.770> weapon<00:04:43.040> it's<00:04:44.030> something<00:04:44.720> that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
kind of the weapon it's something that

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.330 
kind of the weapon it's something that
you<00:04:45.200> really<00:04:45.380> want<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.590> be<00:04:45.650> careful<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:46.100> I

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
you really want to be careful of I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.490 
you really want to be careful of I
personally<00:04:47.090> find<00:04:47.210> this<00:04:47.330> weapon<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.810> lot<00:04:48.050> easier

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
personally find this weapon a lot easier

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.650 
personally find this weapon a lot easier
and<00:04:48.770> better<00:04:48.950> to<00:04:49.190> use<00:04:49.370> one<00:04:49.580> power<00:04:49.790> stance<00:04:50.120> which

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
and better to use one power stance which

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.570 
and better to use one power stance which
is<00:04:50.690> of<00:04:50.990> course<00:04:51.140> why<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.410> keep<00:04:51.770> saying<00:04:51.830> good

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
is of course why I keep saying good

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.130 
is of course why I keep saying good
things<00:04:52.610> about<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:53.060> power<00:04:53.240> stance<00:04:53.480> moveset

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
things about the power stance moveset

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.230 
things about the power stance moveset
I<00:04:54.830> know<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:55.250> barking<00:04:55.490> sorry<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.940> can<00:04:56.060> hear

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240

I know just barking sorry you can hear
her<00:04:56.360> barking<00:04:57.490> overall<00:04:58.490> it's<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.850> really<00:04:58.880> fun

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
her barking overall it's a really fun

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.910 
her barking overall it's a really fun
weapon<00:04:59.600> I<00:04:59.780> enjoyed<00:05:00.110> using<00:05:00.350> it<00:05:00.530> quite<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.830> bit

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
weapon I enjoyed using it quite a bit

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.520 
weapon I enjoyed using it quite a bit
and<00:05:01.420> would<00:05:02.420> really<00:05:02.570> recommend<00:05:02.780> trying<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.440> out

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
and would really recommend trying it out

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.920 
and would really recommend trying it out
if<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.890> have<00:05:04.070> never<00:05:04.310> done<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:05.720> being

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
if you have never done it that being

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.410 
if you have never done it that being
said<00:05:06.320> if<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:06.830> don't<00:05:07.280> like<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.820> great<00:05:08.240> axe

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
said if you don't like the great axe

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.170 
said if you don't like the great axe
class<00:05:08.780> move<00:05:09.200> set<00:05:09.500> well<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.580> can<00:05:10.970> probably

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
class move set well I can probably

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.790 
class move set well I can probably
understand<00:05:11.660> why<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:11.900> would<00:05:12.260> avoid<00:05:12.590> this

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
understand why you would avoid this

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.460 
understand why you would avoid this
thing<00:05:13.010> because<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.810> know<00:05:14.900> using<00:05:15.230> that

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
thing because it is you know using that

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.580 
thing because it is you know using that
move<00:05:15.650> set<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.150> pretty<00:05:17.750> much<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.080> sums<00:05:18.410> up

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
move set so that pretty much it sums up

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.240 
move set so that pretty much it sums up
everything<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:19.220> I<00:05:19.550> have<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.030> say<00:05:20.770> there<00:05:21.770> are

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
everything that I have to say there are

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.910 
everything that I have to say there are
well<00:05:23.150> there<00:05:23.390> is<00:05:23.570> one<00:05:23.600> fight<00:05:24.050> left<00:05:24.230> after<00:05:24.770> this

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
well there is one fight left after this

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.800 
well there is one fight left after this
one<00:05:25.190> I<00:05:25.430> was<00:05:26.000> gonna<00:05:26.120> say<00:05:26.270> there<00:05:26.420> are<00:05:26.540> two<00:05:26.690> more

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
one I was gonna say there are two more

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.330 
one I was gonna say there are two more
fights<00:05:27.080> but<00:05:27.350> well<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.740> guess<00:05:27.980> that<00:05:28.160> wouldn't

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
fights but well I guess that wouldn't

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.740 
fights but well I guess that wouldn't
necessarily<00:05:28.760> be<00:05:28.880> true<00:05:29.120> right<00:05:29.270> now<00:05:29.330> it<00:05:29.570> fought

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
necessarily be true right now it fought

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.930 
necessarily be true right now it fought
it<00:05:29.870> as<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.800> can<00:05:30.920> see<00:05:31.070> though<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:31.490> am<00:05:31.610> missing

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
it as you can see though I am missing

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.250 
it as you can see though I am missing
quite<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.180> few<00:05:32.450> of<00:05:32.540> my<00:05:32.570> hits<00:05:32.810> just<00:05:33.050> by<00:05:33.200> the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
quite a few of my hits just by the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.050 
quite a few of my hits just by the
person<00:05:33.590> simply<00:05:33.770> strafing<00:05:34.400> off<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.820> side<00:05:35.030> a

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
person simply strafing off to the side a

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.940 
person simply strafing off to the side a
little<00:05:35.270> bit<00:05:35.420> just<00:05:35.810> because<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.410> mean<00:05:36.620> unlocks

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
little bit just because I mean unlocks

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.140 
little bit just because I mean unlocks
me<00:05:37.100> in<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.250> direction<00:05:37.340> there's<00:05:37.850> nothing<00:05:38.090> I

can<00:05:38.300> do<00:05:38.360> about<00:05:38.480> it<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:39.680> is<00:05:39.770> one<00:05:39.920> of<00:05:39.950> those<00:05:40.130> guys

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
can do about it it is one of those guys

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.700
