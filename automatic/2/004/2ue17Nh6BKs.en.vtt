00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 I want to play gta 5 but I can't 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.280
 because she is popular because she 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.210
 very popular and its popularity 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.850
 she presses on me as if 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 makes her play I don't 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.720
 I can play although I look down 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 myself I see that I want so with many 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.189
 TV shows popular and movies me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 scares the popularity as if you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.380
 someone makes it look or 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380
 play 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.040
 usually takes place there for example a couple year 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.610
 seasons there if you play the show coherently 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.890
 and then I already play or watch 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.559

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 psychological complex with this you 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 can talk less 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.590

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.930
 gta 5 well, just can not say anything 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.909
 madness as if the country swept 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 a wave of robberies that do 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.799

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.060
