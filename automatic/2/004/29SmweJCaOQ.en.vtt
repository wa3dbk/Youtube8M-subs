at<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> moment<00:00:09.480> we're<00:00:09.990> deep<00:00:10.440> into<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.860> sixth

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
at this moment we're deep into the sixth

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.009 
at this moment we're deep into the sixth
mass<00:00:11.429> extinction<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.330> planet<00:00:12.780> meaning

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
mass extinction on this planet meaning

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.079 
mass extinction on this planet meaning
we've<00:00:13.320> been<00:00:13.530> life<00:00:14.400> has<00:00:14.549> been<00:00:14.700> essentially

we've been life has been essentially

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.580 
we've been life has been essentially
wiped<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.389> five<00:00:15.630> previous<00:00:15.929> times<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.500> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
wiped out five previous times on this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.130 
wiped out five previous times on this
planet<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.820> five<00:00:18.000> previous<00:00:18.390> mass

planet that the five previous mass

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.830 
planet that the five previous mass
extinctions<00:00:19.770> were<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.010> linked<00:00:20.369> with

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
extinctions were all linked with

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.970 
extinctions were all linked with
extraterrestrial<00:00:21.840> factors<00:00:22.230> such<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.410> comets

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
extraterrestrial factors such as comets

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.849 
extraterrestrial factors such as comets
or<00:00:23.100> asteroids<00:00:23.430> hitting<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> earth<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.859> the

or asteroids hitting the earth and the
sixth<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.670> science<00:00:27.029> says<00:00:27.210> we're<00:00:27.420> not

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
sixth one which science says we're not

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.599 
sixth one which science says we're not
flirting<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> we're<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.710> deep<00:00:29.070> into

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
flirting with it we're like deep into

flirting with it we're like deep into
the<00:00:29.760> sixth<00:00:30.060> mass<00:00:30.179> extinction<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.460> all<00:00:32.460> dirty

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the sixth mass extinction is all dirty

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.120 
the sixth mass extinction is all dirty
human<00:00:32.969> behavior<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:34.140> much<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
human behavior and that much of this is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.389 
human behavior and that much of this is
in<00:00:35.309> fact<00:00:36.090> related<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> concept<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.680> we

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
in fact related to a concept that we

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.780 
in fact related to a concept that we

of accident when in fact this is a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.150 
of accident when in fact this is a
complete<00:00:44.730> opposite<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:46.469> were<00:00:46.649> there

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
complete opposite from the we were there

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that is that when we bought into the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
that is that when we bought into the
Darwinian<00:00:53.910> theory<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.750> bought<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.440> way<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
Darwinian theory we bought into a way of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
Darwinian theory we bought into a way of
life<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.219> based<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.640> survival<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
life that's based on survival of the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
life that's based on survival of the
fittest<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> struggle<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.800> life<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
fittest and the struggle for life and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
fittest and the struggle for life and
the<00:01:00.359> actual<00:01:00.840> theory<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> evolution<00:01:01.500> would

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the actual theory of evolution would

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.250 
the actual theory of evolution would
probably<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.760> survival<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.750> those<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
probably be the survival of those that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
probably be the survival of those that
cooperate<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.510> community<00:01:06.930> of

cooperate in the in the community of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
cooperate in the in the community of
life<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.920> that's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.610> completely

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
life and that's a very completely

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.640 
life and that's a very completely
different<00:01:09.689> way<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> looking<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.229> life<00:01:10.260> we're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
different way of looking at life we're

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910 
different way of looking at life we're
not<00:01:10.939> put<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.060> top<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> planet<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.260> evolved

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
not put on top of the planet we evolved

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
not put on top of the planet we evolved
from<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> planet<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.630> destroy<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
from the planet and as we destroy the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
from the planet and as we destroy the
roots<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.030> provided<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.210> us<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.570> destroy

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
roots that provided for us we destroy

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.800 
roots that provided for us we destroy
our<00:01:19.200> own<00:01:19.320> existence<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.659> right<00:01:21.659> now

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
our own existence so we are right now

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
our own existence so we are right now
very<00:01:22.080> seriously<00:01:22.470> facing<00:01:22.950> our<00:01:23.189> major

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
very seriously facing our major

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
very seriously facing our major
extinction<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:24.930> interesting<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.830> most

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
extinction which interesting for most

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
extinction which interesting for most
people<00:01:26.220> who<00:01:26.369> look<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> world<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.479> see

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
people who look at the world don't see

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
people who look at the world don't see
much<00:01:27.780> change<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.799> that's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
much change going on it's like that's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.130 
much change going on it's like that's
the<00:01:29.369> big<00:01:29.549> surprise<00:01:29.700> we're<00:01:30.270> already<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:30.900> the

the big surprise we're already into the
final<00:01:31.640> hoo-ha<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> yet<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.530> not
