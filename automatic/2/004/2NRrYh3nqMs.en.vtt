00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:12.970
 Yes is very much Ogura c 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 Today's video will be a long time since I felt sorry 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.980
 But I'm sorry I'm sorry because there is no real sound about the game 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.510
 Speak Kedomo I can be seen generations eye Well Kedomo I'm content 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.750
 Please come to me with a gate 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 What kind of content 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.130
 It's like saying classy is a real life situation 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.980
 That's why I think it would be good if it made a big hit 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.420
 [musics] 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.480
 I like a question right opinion directly below will receive such kind of thing 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.730
 Well when you saw 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:59.540
 I thought to Fu Tteyuu I'm good if you stick 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.800
 The video of the day before the movie is quite a long time ago but when I started raising the video the crash goes 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.230
 Please pay attention to it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 I have been doing it for a long time 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.929
 I hope for today 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.280
 It is not live condition but there are also retrofit conditions. 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:20.290
 A little saying in the Do You know I say I substitute eye is longer 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 There was that nasty part I don't say in particular I just say it will be longer 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.369
 so 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.210
 Well 5 days I have to say I quit Kedomo I became not a little to the boundary 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.520
 Though 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.090
 Recently recently following is the question and opinion 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.469
 If you put on 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.670
 There is also a thing that I am easy to understand, and a crash is a prison sentence tomorrow 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.530
 Class class live 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.590
 Feeling 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.800
 if 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.160
 Oh dear 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.370
 It is easy to understand that it is Confucianism, and it is a name after 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:56.170
 I Nde There is also the it 's such a one-mer easy to search as a tag 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.650
 As I thought it would be better if you definitely put it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.470
 q But after this video 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:10.890
 I think I'm going to put it all in, but in the case of the sound wilderness and attached 10 strong like today, 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:15.480
 Because I do not live liveliness, I think whether it is the condition of live live iron kale 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:20.180
 Also either put a title only that way when that time will I Monet live play-by-play thinking 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.180
 I think you would like to continue to that way also I think you I 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:30.710
 Thank you very much in the post- minister site or montage 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.770
 What is the connection between the grips and the ones put on music 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:39.830
 So much 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:43.900
 I do not intend to change from English notation, so I will continue to use English notation as before 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.190
 Feeling that what a distribution like a casual clothes 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.350
 As we will raise permission problem 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.120
 I will do without change there thank you 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.580
 In 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.580
 Ne's right Well wonder such Tokoka 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.940
 Yabayan still Mr. Pooh 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.940
 I can not talk, I finished 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.180
 Especially I'm sure I can't speak any more 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:16.390
 Well, I would like to talk to you about it for now. 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.280
 Well, I think now that I have time to talk about one more thing . 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.550
 Ummm 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.300
 It's dlc gold, but the ghost box is already out 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.290
 Pavera of remake map of Modern 2 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.519
 Because I will give four more around map 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.460
 Well I do not know a little bit more detail I still remember in the age of the map a little 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.090
 There is not, though 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:43.090
 Also I'd also go up Nde has entered into such a feeling 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.260
 You know at the time before the dlc 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.330
 I was on the map to Japan on the 1st and 2nd, but 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.120
 As we think that we will raise this on map on the 11th 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:59.830
 Thank you in advance and let's talk about maps a little briefly 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.420
 ea Information I think because there are many people who know 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.810
 Impressions that have my own sound 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.739
 I talk 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.739
 Well I think you all know the modern 2 remake papella, but also 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:20.400
 It is four maps in total with four other four as it is but this time 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.240
 If there is that map specific sound field order 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.470
 When we achieve that Fielder 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 that 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.490
 The effect is unique to that map. 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.910
 Well if it is Fabela ac 30 is out 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.970
 In usable map or other maps 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.390
 I forgot the United States map, but I also 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.900
 It's expensive I thought it seems to be a first rank shop 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.650
 What or who are you one of their own would like wonder if like a maniac women feel 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.289
 taboo 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.180
 Do you say that you can do squat members who can do it 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.620
 It seems like you can increase one squat member 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:04.139
 It's like I could find it for the minute I killed 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.070
 I much I worst not it 's Is this million people coming out that 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.810
 I have anxiety in 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.490
 Certainly it was like that 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.720
 A bit shallow 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:19.160
 If the whether is Wakan'll outline whether there is also a link I'd want you not to swallow 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.060
 Because I think you understand purchase decisions look portrait of deceased person and serves as Kedomo I have put Once that sunny 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.710
 Detailed contents 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.370
 Please check 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.880
 That's kind of map day 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:35.310
 There are many after traps 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.380
 Each one of the map has a trap or 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.710
 Interesting though 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.660
 There is less play with my own arms 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.200
 I wonder what about 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.610
 I think I'm going to do something interesting 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.350
 Well I said the same as before 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.070
 I think that want to go in calling for non-stop recording 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.510
 If you do it once you know how it looks like it's not interesting 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.590
 Hmm 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.420
 It may be another defeat and it may become a defeat game, but I want to go up with one shot 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.210
 Thank you so much 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.960
 In the case of halfway participation 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:15.960
 It's also cute but it feels like that 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.080
 So we will raise If you get forgiveness thank you in the fact that you look forward to 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.129
 Well, it's almost over, right? 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.270
 It became a real mess to talk 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:28.440
 We talked about two things 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.670
 Thank you very much for watching Thank you very much 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.970
 I am waiting 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.970
 Everybody
