 as the first truck really delicious 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.590
 frozen chocolate kiwi lollis and the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.020
 do 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.550
 First you take your kiwis 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.700
 He decides something thicker 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700
 slices 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.079

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.850
 cut her pee off teenies by her 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.620
 almost with the knife inside of the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.300
 shell so a circle around turn 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.129
 then cuts you take like that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.690
 wooden sticks you will find in each 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.579
 Supermarket and just plug in one 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.230
 Kiwi pure to look like lollipops 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.210
 if you did that then you should 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.989
 that look something like that and the devices 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.730
 now before 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.140
 to prepare your chocolate 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.519

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.260
 just in the microwave and then have 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.550
 I just made kiwis friends 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.110
 as you like with chocolate 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.210
 smeared you can do that 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.649
 you only want one side or too 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.840
 only both sides and the edges are not 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.430
 as you would like kiwis would have done 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.990
 then you can just put it back in 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.800
 put the freezer and then have 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.509

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.939
 actually similar to the kiwis only 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.369
 with bananas and that's what you need for it 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.289

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.020
 at will 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.579
 First and foremost, take your bananas and 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.159
 of course, take off the bowl then 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.409
 you turn it into four such about 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.880
 you need equal parts then 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.890
 again wood skewers as before 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.659
 this time is a bit longer then stuck 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 she just almost completely through the band 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.259
 by getting into the banana purely afterwards 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.390

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.679

 again you can pose so much 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.160
 as you like, we need less 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.450
 You want to take chocolate 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.830

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.330
 used to is just a little bit more 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.010
 to beautify it because I'm not so good at that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.319
 by hand and because 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.610
 only then would have to be scattered at 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.959

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.400

 the whole thing would be full of yogurt eating something 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.500
 Just do it with all the berries and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.390
