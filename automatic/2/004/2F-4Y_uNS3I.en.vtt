biologist<00:04:05.480> but<00:04:06.290> I'd<00:04:06.590> say<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.010> looks<00:04:07.070> like

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
biologist but I'd say it looks like

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.360 
biologist but I'd say it looks like
turkey<00:04:07.880> DNA<00:04:08.390> precisely<00:04:09.110> but<00:04:09.980> look<00:04:10.220> how

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
turkey DNA precisely but look how

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.640 
turkey DNA precisely but look how
rapidly<00:04:10.850> its<00:04:11.060> dividing<00:04:11.540> what<00:04:12.140> does<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.440> mean

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
rapidly its dividing what does it mean

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.920 
rapidly its dividing what does it mean
means<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.820> turkeys<00:04:14.210> are<00:04:14.240> growing<00:04:14.720> at<00:04:14.840> an

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
means the turkeys are growing at an

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.960 
means the turkeys are growing at an
exponential<00:04:15.410> rate<00:04:15.560> if<00:04:16.220> we<00:04:16.280> don't<00:04:16.610> destroy

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
exponential rate if we don't destroy

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.310 
exponential rate if we don't destroy
them<00:04:17.180> all<00:04:17.360> they'll<00:04:18.110> take<00:04:18.410> over<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
them all they'll take over the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.930 
them all they'll take over the
maybe<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:20.100> world<00:04:20.310> oh<00:04:20.730> fudge

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
