filter<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.230> action

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.420

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400 

and<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:27.359> too<00:00:27.570> straights<00:00:28.020> for

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
and get that on there too straights for

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.200 
and get that on there too straights for
us<00:00:28.470> first<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> even<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:32.570> kettle<00:00:33.600> empty

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
us first so even with the kettle empty

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.740 
us first so even with the kettle empty
the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.550 
the
trip<00:00:38.380> filter<00:00:38.800> was<00:00:39.130> not<00:00:39.340> enough<00:00:39.610> weight<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:40.560> tip

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
trip filter was not enough weight to tip

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.800 
trip filter was not enough weight to tip
it<00:00:41.710> over<00:00:41.830> so<00:00:42.370> I<00:00:42.400> was<00:00:42.700> very<00:00:42.730> happy<00:00:43.390> about<00:00:43.420> that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
it over so I was very happy about that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.410 
it over so I was very happy about that
so<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.830> way<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.010> aerate<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.950> chill<00:00:50.950> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so it's a way to aerate and chill and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.650 
so it's a way to aerate and chill and
filter<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.300> bubbles<00:00:55.660> I<00:00:55.930> think

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
filter see the bubbles I think

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
filter see the bubbles I think
so<00:00:58.140> there's<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.380> little<00:00:58.590> error<00:00:58.830> getting<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.790> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so there's a little error getting in the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.990 
so there's a little error getting in the
system<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.040> don't<00:01:02.040> know<00:01:02.100> Jenny<00:01:02.490> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.760> about

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
system I don't know Jenny to do about

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
system I don't know Jenny to do about
that
