used to so if you were to change the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
used to so if you were to change the
shocks<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.630> struts<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.350> would<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
shocks and struts how would you want the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
shocks and struts how would you want the
car<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> perform<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.699> would<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.599> feel

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
car to perform I would like it to feel

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.019 
car to perform I would like it to feel
like<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.990> did<00:00:28.109> when<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.619> bought<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
like it did when I first bought it

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
like it did when I first bought it
that's<00:00:30.029> probably<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.810> most<00:00:30.960> common

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that's probably the most common

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
that's probably the most common
situation<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.160> motorist<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.420> likes

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
situation a motorist that really likes

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.389 
situation a motorist that really likes
their<00:00:33.870> vehicle<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.649> they've<00:00:34.800> owned<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> long

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
their vehicle but they've owned it long

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.220 
their vehicle but they've owned it long
enough<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.420> longer<00:00:36.450> rides<00:00:36.989> as

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
enough now that it no longer rides as

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.650 
enough now that it no longer rides as
well<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:37.920> bought<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.210> handling

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
well as when they bought it the handling

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
well as when they bought it the handling
and<00:00:39.780> control<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> no<00:00:40.500> longer<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.100> used<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
and control is no longer what it used to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.670 
and control is no longer what it used to
be<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.390> time<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> put<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> new<00:00:43.379> set<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
be so it's time to put on a new set of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
be so it's time to put on a new set of
shocks<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.280> struts<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.210> motorist<00:00:45.690> would

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
shocks or struts and the motorist would

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
shocks or struts and the motorist would
like<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> product<00:00:46.379> put<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> vehicle<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
like a product put on the vehicle that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
like a product put on the vehicle that
would<00:00:47.850> bring<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> way<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.110> they

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
would bring it back to the way that they

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.799

the<00:00:59.640> motorist<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.629> KY<00:01:00.960> vgr<00:01:01.379> -<00:01:01.710> it's

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the motorist is the KY vgr - it's

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.729 
the motorist is the KY vgr - it's
designed<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.090> restore<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.019> handling<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
designed to restore the handling and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.370 
designed to restore the handling and
control<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> vehicle<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.840> does<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
control of the vehicle now it does that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.109 
control of the vehicle now it does that
because<00:01:07.799> we've<00:01:07.950> added<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
because we've added a little bit of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
because we've added a little bit of
additional<00:01:09.450> damping<00:01:10.140> force<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
additional damping force over the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820 
additional damping force over the
original<00:01:11.700> design<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.080> compensate<00:01:13.650> for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
original design this will compensate for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340 
original design this will compensate for
things<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.130> age<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.850> miles<00:01:15.240> driven<00:01:15.509> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
things like age and miles driven so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.340 
things like age and miles driven so
that's<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> gr<00:01:16.979> -<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.970> twin<00:01:18.509> tube<00:01:18.720> gas

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that's the gr - a twin tube gas

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
that's the gr - a twin tube gas
hydraulic<00:01:20.040> shock<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.490> strut<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.060> designed

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
hydraulic shock or strut that's designed

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
hydraulic shock or strut that's designed
to<00:01:21.540> restore<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> vehicle's<00:01:22.650> capabilities

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
now the GR - usually comes silver like

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.490 
now the GR - usually comes silver like
these<00:01:26.220> -<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:27.990> new<00:01:28.290> applications

components begin with the piston and
valves<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.649> there<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.069> two

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
valves actually there are two

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.119 
valves actually there are two
multi-stage<00:02:09.209> valves<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> piston<00:02:10.920> and

one in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.149 
one in
basse<00:02:11.909> these<00:02:12.720> valves<00:02:13.140> react<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.830> then

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
basse these valves react and then

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.190 
basse these valves react and then
provide<00:02:14.489> control<00:02:15.000> during<00:02:15.569> virtually<00:02:16.049> all

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
provide control during virtually all

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.100 
provide control during virtually all
driving<00:02:16.650> conditions<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.780> working

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
driving conditions now the working

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080 
driving conditions now the working
cylinder<00:02:19.799> that<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> piston<00:02:20.430> works<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.879> is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
cylinder that the piston works in is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.149 
cylinder that the piston works in is
also<00:02:21.390> very<00:02:21.750> important<00:02:22.200> that's<00:02:22.680> why<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.010> use

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
also very important that's why we use

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.850 
also very important that's why we use
seamless<00:02:23.730> extruded<00:02:24.450> tubing<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.049> provides<00:02:25.709> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
seamless extruded tubing it provides a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.339 
seamless extruded tubing it provides a

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.250 
positive seal and consistent performance
very<00:02:29.099> good<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.580> shiny<00:02:30.090> upper<00:02:30.420> shaft<00:02:30.690> isn't

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
very good this shiny upper shaft isn't

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.500 
very good this shiny upper shaft isn't
just<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.620> good<00:02:31.860> looks<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.910> highly<00:02:33.239> polished

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
just for good looks it's highly polished

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.809 
just for good looks it's highly polished
and<00:02:33.900> chromed<00:02:34.260> which<00:02:34.650> avoids<00:02:35.010> any<00:02:35.430> type<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
hydraulic or gas pressure leak now the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.680 
hydraulic or gas pressure leak now the
way<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.489> mounts<00:02:41.849> attach<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.480> shock

way that the mounts attach to the shock

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.930 
way that the mounts attach to the shock
is<00:02:42.930> also<00:02:43.440> very<00:02:43.650> important<00:02:44.069> that's<00:02:44.489> why<00:02:44.760> we

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
is also very important that's why we

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.110 
is also very important that's why we
again<00:02:45.269> use<00:02:45.299> seamless<00:02:45.989> extruded<00:02:46.650> tubing<00:02:47.120> also

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
again use seamless extruded tubing also

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.630 
again use seamless extruded tubing also
