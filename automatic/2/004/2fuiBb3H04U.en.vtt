00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
black rubber thing I think it is that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.799 
black rubber thing I think it is that
goes<00:00:48.840> across<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.879> bumper<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:53.629> some<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
goes across the bumper here and some of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
goes across the bumper here and some of
the<00:00:54.960> red<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.440> goes<00:00:55.710> across<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the red that goes across there if you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:07.120 
the red that goes across there if you
can<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.539> it<00:01:00.859> but<00:01:01.859> otherwise<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.640> pretty<00:01:05.330> and

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130
