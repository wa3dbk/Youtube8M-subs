00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that's true for me and the problem is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.430 
that's true for me and the problem is
and<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> part<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.329> teachers<00:00:57.719> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and it's not the part of teachers but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
and it's not the part of teachers but
because<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> current<00:00:59.280> system<00:00:59.570> we're

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
because of the current system we're

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.209 
because of the current system we're
judging<00:01:00.840> orchids<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.680> were<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> same

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
judging orchids as if they were the same

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.000 
judging orchids as if they were the same
and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.300> role<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.739> looking

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and the role different we're not looking

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.469 
and the role different we're not looking
into<00:01:05.159> people's<00:01:05.309> eyes<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.909> seeing<00:01:06.090> who<00:01:06.270> they

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
into people's eyes and seeing who they

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.350 
into people's eyes and seeing who they
really<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:08.340> compounded<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
really are and it's compounded by this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
really are and it's compounded by this
multi-billion<00:01:09.990> dollar<00:01:10.320> industry<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
multi-billion dollar industry and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.310 
multi-billion dollar industry and
standardized<00:01:11.850> testing<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.479> mean<00:01:13.049> don't<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.260> me

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
wrong i think standardized tests have a

wrong i think standardized tests have a
place<00:01:15.060> sure<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.409> mean<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:17.070> I

and this I think that's really the heart
of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> problem<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.259> kids<00:01:37.470> are

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
of the problem that all kids are

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.600 
of the problem that all kids are
different<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.340> different

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
different they have very different

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.100 
different they have very different
talents<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.150> learn<00:01:39.390> differently<00:01:39.810> they

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
talents they learn differently they

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
talents they learn differently they
think<00:01:40.409> differently<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.009> great<00:01:41.579> teachers

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
think differently and great teachers

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
think differently and great teachers
always<00:01:42.150> knew<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> system<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> we

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
always knew that but the system that we

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.880 
always knew that but the system that we
have<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:45.780> designed<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> meet<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
have now was designed really to meet the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.830 
have now was designed really to meet the
needs<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.220> manufacturing<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
needs of manufacturing and it's like a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
needs of manufacturing and it's like a
manufacturing<00:01:49.560> system<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.790> about

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
manufacturing system you know it's about

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.149 
manufacturing system you know it's about
conformity<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.409> result<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.829> by<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
conformity and the result of that by the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.670 
conformity and the result of that by the
way<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.430> America<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.780> thirty<00:01:55.049> percent<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
way in America is that thirty percent of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.950 
way in America is that thirty percent of
kids<00:01:55.920> drop<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.000> before<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.540> finish<00:01:57.810> high

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
kids drop out before they finish high

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.020 
kids drop out before they finish high
school<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.380> fifty<00:01:59.310> percent<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.820> some

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
school and fifty percent in some

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760 
school and fifty percent in some
communities<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.719> by<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> live<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
communities and by the way I live in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.020 
communities and by the way I live in
America<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> hope<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> don't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
America you know so I hope you don't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.370 
America you know so I hope you don't
feel<00:02:03.119> I've<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.360> come<00:02:03.780> over<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> take<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> few

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
feel I've just come over to take a few

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.020 
feel I've just come over to take a few
shots<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.340> no<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.729> live

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
shots of this you know now no I do live

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
shots of this you know now no I do live
here<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.020> we're<00:02:07.170> very<00:02:07.200> invested<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
here and and we're very invested in this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
here and and we're very invested in this
but<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.789> you've<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.090> 30-percent<00:02:09.750> dropout

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
but when you've got a 30-percent dropout

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.260 
but when you've got a 30-percent dropout
rate<00:02:10.229> maybe<00:02:10.440> fifty<00:02:10.890> percent<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.790> can't<00:02:12.060> blame

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
rate maybe fifty percent you can't blame

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.460 
rate maybe fifty percent you can't blame
kids<00:02:12.599> at<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.750> point

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
kids at that point

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.750 
kids at that point
there's<00:02:13.740> something<00:02:13.950> wrong<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> system

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
there's something wrong with the system

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
there's something wrong with the system
and<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.810> system<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.200> needs<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.590> fixed

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and it's a system that needs to be fixed

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440 
and it's a system that needs to be fixed
and<00:02:17.070> it's<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.520> i<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.030> inhibiting

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and it's it i think it's inhibiting

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.090 
and it's it i think it's inhibiting
teachers<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.050> much<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> kids<00:02:19.770> themselves

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
teachers as much as the kids themselves

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.440 
teachers as much as the kids themselves
where<00:02:20.460> does<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.730> path<00:02:21.000> leader<00:02:21.390> yeah<00:02:21.860> i<00:02:23.450> just

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
where does this path leader yeah i just

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.480 
where does this path leader yeah i just
feel<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.200> kids<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.370> just

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
feel for kids so much you know I just

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.910 
feel for kids so much you know I just
feel<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:27.150> them<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.920> standard

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
feel for them and that and that standard

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.320 
feel for them and that and that standard
that<00:02:29.220> they<00:02:29.430> feel<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.850> somehow<00:02:30.090> they're

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that they feel like somehow they're

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.150 
that they feel like somehow they're
failing<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.320> they<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.500> give<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:31.980> i<00:02:32.130> think

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
failing and then they do give up i think

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.980 
failing and then they do give up i think
they<00:02:32.490> do<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.880> say<00:02:33.000> forget<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:33.720> easier

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
they do just say forget it it's easier

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.140 
they do just say forget it it's easier
to<00:02:34.110> walk<00:02:34.260> away<00:02:34.320> yes<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.060> be

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
to walk away yes then to be there and be

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970 
to walk away yes then to be there and be
wrong<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.750> struggle<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.470> bit<00:02:37.590> knowing

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
wrong and struggle a little bit knowing

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.350 
wrong and struggle a little bit knowing
that<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.370> not<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.640> only<00:02:38.670> way<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.120> define

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that it's not the only way I define

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.480 
that it's not the only way I define
myself<00:02:39.570> but<00:02:40.530> where<00:02:40.680> does<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.950> lead<00:02:41.220> what

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
myself but where does this lead what

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.800 
myself but where does this lead what
what<00:02:41.670> happens<00:02:42.030> how<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.360> improve<00:02:42.450> our

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
what happens how do we improve our

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.420 
what happens how do we improve our
school<00:02:43.050> systems<00:02:43.470> well<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.770> think<00:02:43.890> part<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.340> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
school systems well I think part of it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.550 
school systems well I think part of it
is<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.660> think<00:02:46.170> different<00:02:46.530> about

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
is that we have to think different about

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.010 
is that we have to think different about
ability<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.180> very<00:02:48.390> limited<00:02:48.570> view

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
ability we have a very limited view

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.050 
ability we have a very limited view
these<00:02:49.590> days<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.070> intelligence<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.790> think<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
these days of intelligence we think it's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.300 
these days of intelligence we think it's
all<00:02:51.209> about<00:02:51.450> IQ<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:52.770> know<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.010> really

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
all about IQ you know but really

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.160 
all about IQ you know but really
intelligence<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.000> wonderfully<00:02:54.840> different

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
intelligence is wonderfully different

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.670 
intelligence is wonderfully different
and<00:02:55.530> diverse<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.130> know<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.120> look<00:02:57.240> at<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and diverse you know if you look at the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.500 
and diverse you know if you look at the
crater<00:02:58.950> things<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> people<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.940> dance<00:03:00.209> in

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
crater things that people do in dance in

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990 
crater things that people do in dance in
music<00:03:00.990> in<00:03:01.140> television<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.770> writing<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
music in television and writing in

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.199 
music in television and writing in
literature<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.750> sport<00:03:05.090> intelligence<00:03:06.090> is

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
literature in sport intelligence is

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.720 
literature in sport intelligence is
fantastically<00:03:07.020> diverse<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.370> schools

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
fantastically diverse but in schools

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.730 
fantastically diverse but in schools
were<00:03:09.540> forced<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.230> focus<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> particular

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
were forced to focus on a particular

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.590 
were forced to focus on a particular
type<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.250> intelligence<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.450> really

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
type of intelligence so that's really

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.000 
type of intelligence so that's really
what<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> book<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.200> about<00:03:13.440> them<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.830> first

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
what the book is about them in the first

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.500 
what the book is about them in the first
bitty<00:03:14.310> know<00:03:14.490> when<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.880> save<00:03:15.060> people<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.420> their

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
bitty know when we save people in their

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.600 
bitty know when we save people in their
element<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:16.740> means<00:03:16.920> they're<00:03:17.130> enjoying

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
element it really means they're enjoying

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.560 
element it really means they're enjoying
themselves<00:03:17.790> they're<00:03:18.150> really<00:03:18.390> being

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
themselves they're really being

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.479 
themselves they're really being
themselves<00:03:18.870> doesn't<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:20.310> that's

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
themselves doesn't it and I think that's

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.830 
themselves doesn't it and I think that's
two<00:03:20.790> things<00:03:20.970> one<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.600> you're<00:03:21.720> doing

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
two things one is that you're doing

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210 
two things one is that you're doing
something<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.290> you're<00:03:22.440> naturally<00:03:22.709> good<00:03:23.190> at

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
has changed because you've invested in

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.990 
has changed because you've invested in
the<00:04:19.410> thing<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.799> love<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.130> do<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.790> lead<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
the thing that you love to do you lead a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.760 
the thing that you love to do you lead a
different<00:04:21.180> life<00:04:21.359> because<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.530> your

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
different life because of that and your

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.500 
different life because of that and your
life<00:04:22.950> takes<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.340> different<00:04:23.430> meaning<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.150> I

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
life takes on a different meaning and I

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.050 
life takes on a different meaning and I
think<00:04:24.570> if<00:04:25.260> education<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.830> not<00:04:26.130> about

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
think if education is not about

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.460 
think if education is not about
helping<00:04:27.419> people<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.750> find<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.139> life<00:04:28.290> with

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
helping people to find a life with

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.500 
helping people to find a life with
purpose<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.919> meaning<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.310> fulfillment<00:04:29.520> then

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
purpose and meaning and fulfillment then

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.480 
purpose and meaning and fulfillment then
what<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> about<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.620> know<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.340> do

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
what is it about you know and you do

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.360
