00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.400

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.960

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.610
 grams of 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.460
 but if you do not have sweat, do not 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.310
 like the father or can they do it with 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.500
 jerky in fact the typical recipe is with 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.320
 jerky but I did not find that yes 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.940

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 less 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.079
 a quarter of onion a clove of garlic 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.019

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.179
 the good sauce let's start 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.100
 and we're going to put the tomatoes in the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.680
 tomato 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.600
 these are roasted like chiles 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.820
 and the garlic 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.690
 when threatened, we remove them from 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:23.420
 fire and the same in a capsule already 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.630
 hot we put two tablespoons of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.630
 oil 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.530
 Y 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.830
 we put the meat 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.950
 we are going to put it to be 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.530
 It costs a little bit that it's a little bit fried and 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.869
 they gave me a bone to give it the flavor 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.869
 and here we are going to put salt 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.010
 the we 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.100
 media trade 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.890
 and so we're going to let it be cooked 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.989
 in our swamp now let's continue 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.739
 with the following we are going to add the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.739
 four eggs 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.570
 AHA 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.950
 I put him four eggs because he is 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.240
 little but according to you the amount 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.520
 per 100 grams is like an egg 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.830
 already with 300 of a multiple is 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.830
 proposing 4 revolve 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.290
 and we let it start to put god 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.220
 we are returning it consciously and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.980
 we add another little 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.980
 of salt to be sanctioned with the egg 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.989
 good while he 's making the egg 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.989
 with the salt shaker in the blender jar 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.570
 I already have here my and you take the tomatoes 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.530
 this garlic the chiles we are going to 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.530
 add them to the liquefied 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.709
 so so 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.070
 and lake and we're going to add a pinch of 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.070
 cumin 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.170
 I already have my measure but if you do not 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.540
 they know they add what they do they will do 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.370
 tip of the spoon 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.939
 we add water plant to be 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.939
 can grind 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.880
 We liquefy that it is not very ground to the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.270
 sauce has to look like a little 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.270
 whole 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.900
 how is the picture with him 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.880
 with the egg 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.860
 you can see the well-cooked egg 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.770
 I left it like 5 minutes stirring 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.670
 stirring now is when we go to 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.670
 add our sauce 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.420
 let's say to stir 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.289
 as I was saying this is a typical recipe 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.749
 of the warrior 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.749
 the part of the parties as 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.700
 altamirano miss watching the warriors 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.160
 and it tastes very delicious to me the truth is not 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.440
 I know before I was know now 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.840
 I would not have thought of doing this 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:07.760
 good dish we let it boil 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.760
 around 10 minutes and we turn off
