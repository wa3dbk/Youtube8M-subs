two-day shipping and it got there

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.549 
two-day shipping and it got there
exactly<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.309> posed<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.180> you

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
exactly when it was posed two so you

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
exactly when it was posed two so you
should<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.770> about<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.489> have

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
should think about that you don't have

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
should think about that you don't have
to<00:00:50.670> keep<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.270> pay<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> monthly<00:00:51.719> fee<00:00:52.020> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
so I'm planning on keeping these in for

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.950 
so I'm planning on keeping these in for
about<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> month<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.930> how

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
about a month and in and just see how

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.749 
about a month and in and just see how
things<00:02:04.229> turn<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.790> taking<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> biotin

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
things turn out so I'm taking the biotin

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.510 
things turn out so I'm taking the biotin
checking<00:02:08.759> tons<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.989> water<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> try

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
checking tons of water I'm going to try

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
checking tons of water I'm going to try
to<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.030> couple<00:02:12.330> liters<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.900> water<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.290> mia

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to get a couple liters of water in mia

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700 
to get a couple liters of water in mia
so<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.670> maybe<00:02:14.820> try<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.290> counteract<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
so I can maybe try to counteract that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.160 
so I can maybe try to counteract that
reaction<00:02:17.640> since<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.360> such<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> high<00:02:18.900> dosage

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
reaction since it's such a high dosage

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
reaction since it's such a high dosage
um<00:02:21.260> take<00:02:22.260> these<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.770> month<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.100> see

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
um take these out in a month and see

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.330
