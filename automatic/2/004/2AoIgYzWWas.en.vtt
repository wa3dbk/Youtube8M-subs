00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

so<00:00:00.299> in<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.659> video<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.439> just<00:00:01.500> gonna<00:00:01.800> address

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so in this video I'm just gonna address

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.990 
so in this video I'm just gonna address
bar<00:00:03.179> rotation<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:03.990> deadlift<00:00:04.609> so<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.790> is

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
bar rotation on the deadlift so this is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.700 
bar rotation on the deadlift so this is
something<00:00:06.450> if<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.810> pulled<00:00:07.049> double<00:00:07.379> overhand

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
something if you pulled double overhand

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.669 
something if you pulled double overhand
or<00:00:08.099> with<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> hook<00:00:08.550> grip<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.750> double<00:00:10.349> overhand

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
or with the hook grip so double overhand

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.070 
or with the hook grip so double overhand
like<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.219> hook<00:00:11.700> grip<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.210> you'll

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
like that hook grip like that you'll

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.509 
like that hook grip like that you'll
have<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> worry<00:00:13.500> about<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.099> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
have to worry about this this is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.220 
have to worry about this this is
literally<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.940> thing<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.480> anybody<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
literally a thing for anybody with a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.109 
literally a thing for anybody with a
mixed<00:00:16.529> grip<00:00:16.770> which<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.670> would<00:00:17.789> say<00:00:17.970> it's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
mixed grip which I would say it's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.269 
mixed grip which I would say it's
probably<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.660> 90%<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.500> pullers<00:00:19.920> when<00:00:20.160> they

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
probably like 90% of pullers when they

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.939 
probably like 90% of pullers when they
get<00:00:20.460> too<00:00:21.029> heavy<00:00:21.210> enough<00:00:21.510> weight<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.109> what

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
get too heavy enough weight and what

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
get too heavy enough weight and what
happens<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.640> you're<00:00:23.939> under<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.990> I

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
happens is you're under and so I

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.560 
happens is you're under and so I
typically<00:00:25.769> hold<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> bar<00:00:26.789> mixed<00:00:27.150> grip<00:00:27.359> like

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
typically hold the bar mixed grip like

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.810 
typically hold the bar mixed grip like
this<00:00:27.680> this<00:00:28.680> Andre<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.490> how<00:00:29.640> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
this this Andre and you see how it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.780 
this this Andre and you see how it's
kind<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.230> your<00:00:31.230> wrist<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.710> uh<00:00:31.740> cocked<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
kind of like your wrist is uh cocked a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.690 
kind of like your wrist is uh cocked a
little<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> inside<00:00:33.739> well<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:35.550> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
little bit to the inside well what that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
little bit to the inside well what that
does<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> kicks<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> bar<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.350> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
does is that kicks the bar on there this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.889 
does is that kicks the bar on there this
side<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.610> front<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.940> me<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:39.719> almost

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
side in front of me so I'm almost

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
side in front of me so I'm almost
pulling<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.070> easy<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.489> me<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.820> out

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
pulling and it's easy for me to get out

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
pulling and it's easy for me to get out
like<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.649> basically<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
like this so basically you have to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.549 
like this so basically you have to
really<00:00:44.190> consciously<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:45.149> about

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
really consciously think about

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.100 
really consciously think about
overcompensating<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> side<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
overcompensating on this side and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.900 
overcompensating on this side and
tilting<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.590> wrist<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> rotating<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
tilting this this wrist and rotating it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.299 
tilting this this wrist and rotating it
or<00:00:51.750> rotating<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> should<00:00:52.860> say<00:00:53.039> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
or rotating it out I should say you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.439 
or rotating it out I should say you
literally<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> consciously<00:00:54.090> think

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
literally have to consciously think

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
literally have to consciously think
about<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:55.890> easy<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> bar

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
about this or it's very easy for the bar

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.569 
about this or it's very easy for the bar
to<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.850> kick<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.300> front<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
to just kick out in front of you and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
to just kick out in front of you and
you'll<00:00:59.579> miss<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> lift<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:00.899> gonna

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you'll miss the lift and so I'm gonna

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.160 
you'll miss the lift and so I'm gonna
show<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.469> videos<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.899> basically<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.080> I'm

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
show two videos of basically what I'm

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.880 
show two videos of basically what I'm
talking<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> first<00:01:05.309> video<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:06.890> 710

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
talking about now the first video is 710

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.270 
talking about now the first video is 710
pounds<00:01:08.400> um<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.299> took<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.140> probably<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> month<00:01:11.130> ago

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
pounds um I took it probably a month ago

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.990 
pounds um I took it probably a month ago
and<00:01:11.960> you'll<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.290> especially<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.610> third

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and you'll see especially on that third

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.020 
and you'll see especially on that third
and<00:01:15.150> fourth<00:01:15.450> rep<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.950> start<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> bar

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and fourth rep I start to have the bar

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
and fourth rep I start to have the bar
kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.360> kick<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.869> front<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
kind of kick out in front of me and I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
kind of kick out in front of me and I
almost<00:01:19.950> missed<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.850> fourth<00:01:21.090> rep<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> real

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
almost missed the fourth rep it's a real

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
almost missed the fourth rep it's a real
grinder<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.159> looks<00:01:23.430> horrible

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
grinder it looks horrible

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
grinder it looks horrible
because<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> bar<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.229> far<00:01:25.500> away<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
because the bar is far away from me and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
because the bar is far away from me and
I'm<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.430> pulling<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.060> closed<00:01:27.360> due<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I'm not pulling it in closed due to this

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
I'm not pulling it in closed due to this
wrist<00:01:28.530> rotation<00:01:28.799> where<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
wrist rotation where it's like this and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.819 
wrist rotation where it's like this and
it's<00:01:30.570> kicking<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.930> bar<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.229> front<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> me

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it's kicking the bar out in front of me

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's kicking the bar out in front of me
so<00:01:32.430> notice<00:01:32.759> how<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.939> doesn't<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.420> happen

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so notice how that doesn't really happen

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
so notice how that doesn't really happen
on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> open<00:01:34.380> side<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> overhead<00:01:35.189> side<00:01:35.430> it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
on the open side the overhead side it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.120 
on the open side the overhead side it's
just<00:01:36.299> pretty<00:01:36.570> straight<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.590> worry<00:01:37.860> about

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
just pretty straight I don't worry about

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.130 
just pretty straight I don't worry about
anything<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:41.030> naturally

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
anything like this or this but naturally

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.719 
anything like this or this but naturally
when<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.590> hand<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.460> where

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
when you go on your hand this is where

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
naturally it's gonna be it's gonna be

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.280 
naturally it's gonna be it's gonna be
about<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.600> 45<00:01:51.600> degree<00:01:51.750> angle<00:01:51.930> or

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
about here and a 45 degree angle or

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.719 
about here and a 45 degree angle or
whatever<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:52.920> gonna<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.460> like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
whatever it's not gonna just be like

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.310 
whatever it's not gonna just be like
this<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> shot<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> straight<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.259> out

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
this if you shot it straight in and out

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.889 
this if you shot it straight in and out
flat<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.680> feels<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:56.130> awkward<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
flat it feels very awkward so you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
flat it feels very awkward so you
literally<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.250> think<00:01:59.520> about

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
literally are gonna have to think about

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120 
literally are gonna have to think about
this<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> pull<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.290> second<00:02:01.710> video<00:02:01.950> was

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this when you pull the second video was

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.560 
this when you pull the second video was
from<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> other<00:02:02.549> day<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.149> working<00:02:03.479> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
from the other day when I was working on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.249 
from the other day when I was working on
correcting<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:06.000> keep<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> warran

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
correcting this and I keep the warran

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
correcting this and I keep the warran
very<00:02:07.500> close<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.220> side<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.819> not<00:02:08.970> kicking

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
very close on that side it's not kicking

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.089 
very close on that side it's not kicking
out<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.810> reps<00:02:10.229> look<00:02:10.470> smoother

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
out the reps look smoother

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.440 
out the reps look smoother
so<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.940> something

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
so just something

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.830 
so just something
think<00:02:12.569> about<00:02:12.800> I've<00:02:13.800> probably<00:02:14.160> missed

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
think about I've probably missed

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.300 
think about I've probably missed
countless<00:02:15.840> deadlifts<00:02:16.410> because<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.010> very

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
countless deadlifts because of this very

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.369

lose it so if the bar kicks out on the
other<00:02:42.599> hand<00:02:42.900> side<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.709> gonna<00:02:43.860> make<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
other hand side it's just gonna make the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.670 
other hand side it's just gonna make the
lockout<00:02:44.670> much<00:02:45.000> tougher<00:02:45.319> you're<00:02:46.319> gonna<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.560> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
lockout much tougher you're gonna get to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.020 
lockout much tougher you're gonna get to
your<00:02:46.799> knees<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.220> might<00:02:47.400> miss<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> lift

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
your knees and you might miss the lift

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.270

because of that so just look at the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850 
because of that so just look at the
differences<00:02:50.810> first<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.500> wrong<00:02:52.650> way

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
differences first one is the wrong way

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.949 
differences first one is the wrong way
to<00:02:52.920> do<00:02:53.099> it<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.060> second<00:02:54.390> video<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> right

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
to do it the second video is the right

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.470 
to do it the second video is the right
way<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.319> it
