00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.289
 chain and this is a tip that I was 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.789
 given by not a subscriber to easy 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.939
 but by a youtuber that starts 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:35.090
 since not very long ago and a month goes 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.640
 he is on vacation in nice to him reaches 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.870
 weezy hello tied she's just a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.400
 can have cut when we have too much 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.190
 but good 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.680
 so this is a little tip that will you 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.490
 pay big for a small profit so 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.080
 just ore kraft we're going 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490
 talk about the weezy chain at the end 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.650
 so let's go I show a whole 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.370
 little what does it look like 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.200
 at this just 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.330
 so you have cracked bonito whose 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.580
 look at the 100 kg unit to the famine 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.170
 and 400000 as the hundred so that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.270
 depends on samoa i'm sure domains 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.600
 for example how many know where I have to 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.030
 also 2001 ankama an idea would this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.950
 movie will watch if it's just 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.540
 a body 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.530
 that's it and how much and how much 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.900
 hundred tents our minkama so that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.860
 does 298 because he is Belgian there you 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.409
 pissed off with her dayal gills go 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.330
 so the bonito what's good is 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.560
 that in this trick kama you'll 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.630
 no need for drugs you do not have 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.690
 need to be minor you have not 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.100
 need to have used the a big big 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.380
 profit does not swear a lot of kids at 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.229
 just 40 min 58 is enough 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.040
 to start this trick so for the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.770
 kraft it's simple it takes 10 bronze says 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.570
 iron and copper so look at the price 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.400
 avoid skipjack and five minutes 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.760
 to get the price of the brass so 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.620
 copper said to himself but so did it but 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.280
 a meaning will write it right away so 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.450
 its 1500 plus what else or isi 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.310
 uh coppery bronze iron so diglee do 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.380
 says he says bron and so I have not 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.140
 way too good yeah that's 1300 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.490
 the more we do not go why I saw more 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.690
 do it that's it it's wimille after that 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.690
 rose just now it was 500 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.840
 yet yeah yeah but I do not care 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.209
 on his hunger so that's 1,500 more 1300 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.670
 more listen to me makes 1,500 so that makes 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.860
 3000 so that makes it stand 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.380
 it's three thousand and three hundred so 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:47.660
 Come on, let's go and buy all that stuff 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:51.200
 hop iron bronze up but 300 plus iron 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.819
 copper is that yes yes that's right 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.500
 we have everything we need now 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.550

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.840
 is going to look for a good leader and while 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.680
 still hoping to find one of 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.019
 available 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.290
 so I will try a little bit 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.459
 weezy present his chair while waiting 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.590
 ben ok thank you 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.290
 so me I introduce myself it's yes ninon 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.540
 going so I started the videos ago 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.380
 a month and a few days so 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.450
 logically that it's through a few 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.489
 kamau tips that I advise you so 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.829
 I'm really looking for little tips or 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.060
 not very well known because and also 10 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.730
 tips that do not require trades 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.700
 blood levels or tim cronk that such 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.840
 person character team persona 2 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.880
 million km base so I try 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.010
 really played on that rather it's 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.720
 too much for the little known assets in all 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.700
 case so that's it if you want some 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.230
 hints some mini series that go 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.739
 soon to arrive did not go to see my 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.739
 chain so voila so here's me from my 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.590
 side I think I found a minor 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.840
 for low 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.099
 this youtube haye chain a guy who 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.870
 do what's ugly and youtube 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.760
 pass me then dedication of a physical 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:02.129
 but on the other hand, it's me 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.950
 could bonite that's it then is it 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.420
 is 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.209
 should not make it pay over 1000 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.280
 hand case otherwise it will be beneficial to very 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.980
 just so it is less obvious to find 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.480
 a his part that a minor level 3 bit the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.979
 so crafter how the city a 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.329
 minor level 30 are often free 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.199
 so do not hesitate to pick up a 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.870
 more bl 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:29.910
 so that's who was able to amass 100 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:35.820
 kamal units so that makes sense because 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:41.570
 my inclusive bah yeah and daily 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.570
 have to listen to Sunday make that a 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.030
 yes we will answer anyway because 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.870
 that's not to leave then yes ok there 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:57.050
 so our our little miner and has it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.930
 so hop asia then hop that's it and we 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.590
 will give him 100 km he made them 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.130
 free 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.600
 a machine burns for free ah 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.150
 yeah he did it for free at the beginning 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.020
 I pay them so here's thanks to 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.650

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.979

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.289
 minors therefore to notice that it is a 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.630
 benefit of 2 see me 1500 it depends on the 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.770
 servers and worse there is no 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.599

 I often put food tips 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:51.289
