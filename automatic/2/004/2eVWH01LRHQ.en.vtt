high evidence John from dial tone
pickups<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.370> I<00:00:02.879> just<00:00:03.120> want<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> talk<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.080> little

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
pickups and I just want to talk a little

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.570 
pickups and I just want to talk a little
bit<00:00:04.410> more<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.100> product<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.460> we

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
bit more about the the product that we

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.720 
bit more about the the product that we
have<00:00:05.730> so<00:00:06.029> right<00:00:06.899> now<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:07.830> we're<00:00:07.980> introducing

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
have so right now what we're introducing

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.299 
have so right now what we're introducing
is<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> new<00:00:09.719> pickup<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.500> actually<00:00:10.650> has<00:00:10.920> tone

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
is a new pickup it actually has tone

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.430 
is a new pickup it actually has tone
control<00:00:11.670> built<00:00:11.910> into<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.840> body<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> case

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
control built into the body of the case

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.860 
control built into the body of the case
and<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.490> allows<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.969> lot<00:00:15.330> more<00:00:15.480> control

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
and it allows you a lot more control

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.240 
and it allows you a lot more control
over<00:00:16.139> your<00:00:16.470> sound<00:00:16.710> than<00:00:16.920> what<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> get<00:00:17.190> from

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
over your sound than what you get from

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.450 
over your sound than what you get from
your<00:00:17.490> traditional<00:00:18.050> tone<00:00:19.050> knob<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.859> instead<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
your traditional tone knob so instead of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.679 
your traditional tone knob so instead of
just<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.939> tone<00:00:21.090> knob<00:00:21.240> works<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.630> by

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
just like tone knob works just by

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.259 
just like tone knob works just by
rolling<00:00:22.080> off<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.470> certain<00:00:22.619> frequency<00:00:23.269> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
rolling off a certain frequency this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.240 
rolling off a certain frequency this
actually<00:00:24.660> gives<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> active<00:00:25.260> control<00:00:25.710> over

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
actually gives you active control over

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.179 
actually gives you active control over
your<00:00:26.609> tones<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:28.320> turns<00:00:28.529> out<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:29.010> how<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
your tones so it turns out like how a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
your tones so it turns out like how a
pickup<00:00:29.519> actually<00:00:29.849> works<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.420> two<00:00:30.750> main

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
pickup actually works you get two main

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
pickup actually works you get two main
parameters<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.769> control<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
parameters so you can control like so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.459 
parameters so you can control like so
the<00:00:32.910> freak<00:00:33.120> resonant<00:00:33.780> frequency<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> then

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the freak resonant frequency and then

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.350 
the freak resonant frequency and then
the<00:00:34.590> shape<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.980> resonance<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the shape of that resonance and this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.610 
the shape of that resonance and this
allows<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> adjust<00:00:36.899> both<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.530> those

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
allows you to adjust both of those

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.360 
allows you to adjust both of those
independently<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.120> each<00:00:39.360> knob<00:00:39.600> controls<00:00:40.469> each

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
independently so each knob controls each

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.270 
independently so each knob controls each
of<00:00:41.520> those<00:00:41.610> parameters<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.190> we<00:00:44.190> have

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
of those parameters and so we have

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.020 
of those parameters and so we have
everything's<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.300> an<00:00:45.390> aluminum<00:00:45.870> case<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.530> have

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
everything's in an aluminum case we have

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.979 
everything's in an aluminum case we have
machined<00:00:48.030> aluminum<00:00:48.539> option<00:00:49.079> black<00:00:49.890> anodized

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
machined aluminum option black anodized

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.410 
machined aluminum option black anodized
as<00:00:51.989> well<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.440> different<00:00:53.190> different<00:00:54.030> plating

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
as well as different different plating

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
as well as different different plating
so<00:00:54.660> gold<00:00:55.260> plated<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.860> chrome<00:00:56.219> plated<00:00:56.640> options

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so gold plated or chrome plated options

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.750 
so gold plated or chrome plated options
as<00:00:57.480> well<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.910> in<00:00:59.910> addition<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> being<00:01:00.600> able<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
as well so in addition to being able to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.939 
as well so in addition to being able to
control<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.969> tone<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.530> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> back<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
control the tone on the on the back of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
control the tone on the on the back of
the<00:01:05.040> pickup<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:05.760> adjust<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the pickup you can actually adjust the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320 
the pickup you can actually adjust the
gain<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:07.830> players<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.520> run<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> sort

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
gain so some players like to run a sort

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
gain so some players like to run a sort
of<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> fixed<00:01:09.780> level<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.650> that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
of a fixed level and you can do that

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
of a fixed level and you can do that
just<00:01:10.950> by<00:01:11.040> putting<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> jumper<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> back<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
just by putting a jumper on the back of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
just by putting a jumper on the back of
these<00:01:12.810> pins<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.580> or<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.030> run<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.240> out

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
these pins here or you can run this out

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
these pins here or you can run this out
to<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> potentiometer<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.759> adjustable

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to a potentiometer and have adjustable

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.280 
to a potentiometer and have adjustable
gain<00:01:17.909> built<00:01:18.180> into<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> body<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> guitar

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
gain built into the body of the guitar

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
gain built into the body of the guitar
so<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.400> each<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.790> guitars<00:01:21.180> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
so that's how each of these guitars are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.530 
so that's how each of these guitars are
wired<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.890> I've<00:01:23.610> replaced<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.390> my

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
wired up now so I've replaced on my

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
wired up now so I've replaced on my
guitar<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.869> replaced<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> tone<00:01:25.830> pot<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
guitar I replaced the tone pot with a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.240 
guitar I replaced the tone pot with a
gain<00:01:27.150> pot<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:29.360> can<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:31.170> gives<00:01:32.130> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
gain pot and can really gives you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
gain pot and can really gives you
control<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> main<00:01:33.090> parameters<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
control over the main parameters that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
control over the main parameters that
you<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> player<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you really like to see as a player so to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
you really like to see as a player so to
make<00:01:36.750> things<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.170> easier<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.650> people

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
make things a little easier for people

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130 
make things a little easier for people
to<00:01:38.130> install<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.790> folks<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to install or folks that are kind of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.649 
to install or folks that are kind of
averse<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.439> soldering<00:01:41.060> we've<00:01:42.060> actually

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
averse to soldering we've actually

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
averse to soldering we've actually
developed<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.259> wiring<00:01:43.710> kit<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.490> make

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
developed a wiring kit to to make

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.999 
developed a wiring kit to to make
everything<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.360> lot<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:45.899> simple<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
everything a lot more simple for when it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
everything a lot more simple for when it
goes<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> install<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.450> wire<00:01:48.630> up

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
goes to install so if you can wire up

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.859 
goes to install so if you can wire up
Les<00:01:49.770> Paul<00:01:50.009> style<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.909> any<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> custom

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
Les Paul style or any kind of custom

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.630 
Les Paul style or any kind of custom
configuration<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.280> master

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
configuration that you want like master

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
configuration that you want like master
tone<00:01:53.820> master<00:01:54.270> volume<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:55.649> possible

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
tone master volume that's all possible

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.430 
tone master volume that's all possible
so

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.290 
so
we<00:01:57.530> had<00:01:57.620> some<00:01:57.890> potentiometers<00:01:58.730> custom-made

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
we had some potentiometers custom-made

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.100 
we had some potentiometers custom-made
for<00:01:59.510> this<00:01:59.740> custom<00:02:00.740> circuit<00:02:00.950> boards<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:02.110> and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
for this custom circuit boards so and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.200 
for this custom circuit boards so and
the<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.650> cabling<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.190> just<00:02:04.370> kind<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.060> just

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
the the cabling you just kind of just

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.260 
the the cabling you just kind of just
clip<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.510> on<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.870> that's<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:07.000> allows<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.180> a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
clip it on and that's the allows it's a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.760 
clip it on and that's the allows it's a
really<00:02:08.600> simple<00:02:08.780> installation<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:11.300> then<00:02:12.230> this

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
really simple installation so then this

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.260 
really simple installation so then this
is<00:02:12.830> actually<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.340> actually<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> graph<00:02:13.910> for

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
is actually this is actually a graph for

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.580 
is actually this is actually a graph for
people<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.660> are<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> little<00:02:14.900> more<00:02:15.020> technical

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
people that are a little more technical

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.860 
people that are a little more technical
what<00:02:15.800> our<00:02:15.950> pickups<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.610> do<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.150> one<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
what our pickups actually do so one of

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.570 
what our pickups actually do so one of
the<00:02:18.020> knobs<00:02:18.200> lets<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.650> go<00:02:18.800> left<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.280> right<00:02:19.430> by

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the knobs lets you go left and right by

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.160 
the knobs lets you go left and right by
changing<00:02:19.970> your<00:02:20.030> resonant<00:02:20.420> frequency<00:02:20.870> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
changing your resonant frequency and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.200 
changing your resonant frequency and
then<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.680> other<00:02:21.770> knob<00:02:21.980> allows<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.970> change

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
then the other knob allows you to change

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.330 
then the other knob allows you to change
the<00:02:23.360> shape<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> resonance<00:02:24.050> by<00:02:24.320> like<00:02:24.680> how

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the shape of the resonance by like how

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.700 
the shape of the resonance by like how
Peaks<00:02:25.730> how<00:02:26.180> controlled<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.020> how<00:02:27.290> peaky

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
Peaks how controlled like the how peaky

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.350 
Peaks how controlled like the how peaky
the<00:02:27.860> peak<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.670> kind<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> best<00:02:29.240> way

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the peak is this is kind of the best way

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.780 
the peak is this is kind of the best way
to<00:02:29.450> describe<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.920> you're<00:02:31.550> able<00:02:31.760> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
to describe it so it you're able to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.850 
to describe it so it you're able to
control<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.690> lot<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.410> sound<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
control a lot of the the sound in the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.950 
control a lot of the the sound in the
whole<00:02:33.950> frequency<00:02:34.400> space<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.300> regular<00:02:35.660> pickup

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
whole frequency space so regular pickup

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.140 
whole frequency space so regular pickup
works<00:02:36.230> by<00:02:36.620> however<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.910> coil

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
works by however you have the the coil

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.600 
works by however you have the the coil
set<00:02:38.480> gives<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.560> certain<00:02:39.770> inductance<00:02:40.460> or

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
set gives you certain inductance or

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.730 
set gives you certain inductance or
capacitance<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.240> get<00:02:41.390> basically<00:02:41.780> one<00:02:42.440> shape

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
capacitance you get basically one shape

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.940 
capacitance you get basically one shape
with<00:02:43.700> ours<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.330> our<00:02:44.480> fire<00:02:45.380> pick<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:45.830> can

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
with ours with our fire pick up you can

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.470 
with ours with our fire pick up you can
actually<00:02:46.070> cover<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.700> lot<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> different<00:02:47.300> shapes

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
actually cover a lot of different shapes

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.530 
actually cover a lot of different shapes
get<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> lot<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.380> different<00:02:48.440> sound<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.540> as

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
get a lot of different sound out and as

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.940 
get a lot of different sound out and as
a<00:02:50.630> player<00:02:50.960> gives<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.320> lot<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> lot<00:02:51.830> of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
a player gives you a lot of a lot of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.400 
a player gives you a lot of a lot of
options<00:02:52.070> for<00:02:52.870> picking<00:02:53.870> up<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.080> sound<00:02:54.290> that

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
options for picking up the sound that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.890 
options for picking up the sound that
you<00:02:54.500> really<00:02:54.710> want
