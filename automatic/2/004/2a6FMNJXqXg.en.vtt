00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.970
 way to pray another good way to pray 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.819
 is to pray for others without giving 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.860
 account that is excellent all for the 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.930
 street are you in college in the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.480
 school children in kindergarten 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.609
 where they are and there are quiet 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.010
 a prayer for the others we think 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.420
 we ask for peace or welfare or health for 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.370
 the person who is in front of what 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 is behind or the one that crosses a couple 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.510
 that there goes a baby that goes in a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.060
 cradle someone who is very desperate 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.550
 we can pray for people without 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.110
 already you perceive a very nice prayer 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.180
 because it is sincere and spontaneous without 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.550
 consideration you have done another good 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.560
 way to pray find places that you 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.330
 always connect with God whenever 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.090
 you go in front of a clinic to a hospital 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.250
 thank you for having health and hours for 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.410
 the sick people are there, you pass in front of 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.750
 a temple does not matter if he is a Christian 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.970
 presbyterian pentecostal hours so that 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.120
 in that place God is present and the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.980
 people have faith you go and spend a funeral 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.049
 hours for the person who died for their 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.030
 relatives whenever you cross in front of 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.549
 a funeral home hours for deaths by 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.700
 their relatives very easy to pass a 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.200
 ambulance hears the mermaid hours by the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.810
 sick that goes there or the person who are going 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.580
 to pick up look how easy it is to pray what 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.319
 I will remember when a 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.630
 ambulance that passes in front of a 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.250
 funeral or passes a funeral in front of 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.709
 a clinic to a hospital in front of a 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.000
 temple hours hours for people with 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.650
 those you cross without realizing 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.340
 and also today I always say father 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.750

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.959

 love and feel with love so that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.410
 Let's learn to pray better not so much with 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.870
 words but with the mind and with the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.139
 heart always in tune with the god 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.139
 of love 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.130
 I ask the guardian angel and the angel 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.350
 day of all of you and mine 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.980
 every day we feel that presence of the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.000
 guardian angel and the guide angel 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.000
 Very good days
