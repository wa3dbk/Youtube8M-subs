00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
about the anchor nine port USB hub which

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
about the anchor nine port USB hub which
also<00:00:06.450> includes<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:07.140> charging<00:00:07.500> port<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.370> can

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
also includes one charging port you can

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.640 
also includes one charging port you can
see<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.820> there<00:00:08.970> are<00:00:09.000> nine<00:00:09.300> USB<00:00:09.809> 3<00:00:10.110> ports<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
see that there are nine USB 3 ports and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.560 
see that there are nine USB 3 ports and
in<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.190> port<00:00:11.490> at<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> bottom<00:00:12.000> which<00:00:12.540> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
in one port at the bottom which is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.629 
in one port at the bottom which is
designated<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.679> black<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.190> actually<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
designated in black is actually the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.939 
designated in black is actually the
charging<00:00:15.089> port<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.410> will<00:00:16.560> actually<00:00:16.740> let

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
charging port so this will actually let

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
charging port so this will actually let
you<00:00:17.070> plug<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:17.850> USB<00:00:18.270> devices<00:00:18.570> most

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the port speeds are very good I've

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
the port speeds are very good I've
tested<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> couple<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> different

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
tested it with a couple of different

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
tested it with a couple of different
flash<00:01:10.409> drives<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.430> charging<00:01:11.909> port<00:01:12.060> works

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
flash drives the charging port works

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
flash drives the charging port works
very<00:01:12.450> well<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.840> charges<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.290> fast<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.710> plugging

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
very well it charges as fast as plugging

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.090 
very well it charges as fast as plugging
into<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> USB<00:01:14.640> 3<00:01:15.060> directly<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.590> computer

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
into the USB 3 directly of your computer

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
into the USB 3 directly of your computer
but<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.970> notice<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> device

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
but one thing I notice about the device

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.609 
but one thing I notice about the device
is<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> lot<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> cords<00:01:19.500> plugged

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
is when you have a lot of cords plugged

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.429 
is when you have a lot of cords plugged
in<00:01:19.939> by<00:01:20.939> default<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.810> device<00:01:22.049> will<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
in by default the device will want to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.140 
in by default the device will want to
lie<00:01:22.560> flat<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
lie flat like this but we have a lot of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.609 
lie flat like this but we have a lot of
quartz<00:01:24.420> plugs<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> tends<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> pull<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.530> on

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
quartz plugs and it tends to pull it on

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.080 
quartz plugs and it tends to pull it on
one<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> sides<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.610> stays<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
one of the sides so it stays on all the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.429 
one of the sides so it stays on all the
sides<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.750> would<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.960> been<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.200> they

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
sides it would have been nice if they

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
sides it would have been nice if they
put<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.740> rubberized<00:01:29.460> feet<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.750> bottom<00:01:30.900> of
