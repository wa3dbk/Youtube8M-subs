 opportunity for those who are looking for 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.630
 placing on the market 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.570
 in this period there is an increase in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.289
 vacancies in all regions of the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.910
 the internship season she concentrates 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.310
 at the turn of the year at the end of the semester 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.590
 this period of the year is usually the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 companies are looking at the theme of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.330
 budget for the planning theme 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.910
 planning for next year and it is where 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.630
 appear in fact is the opportunities a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.899
 more competition 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.480
 is smaller more candidates are going to be absent 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.129
 and you will be competing with a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
 minor group 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.989
 the competition will be smaller the more 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 require further preparation of the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.300
 participant is a great differential. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 domain in other languages ​​such as English 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.670
 without forgetting the Portuguese language and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.199
 knowledge in computer science 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.640
 other skills 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.790
 I think today the professional that he 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.310
 want to stand out it needs to have is yes 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 a good technical knowledge she desires 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.600
 that this student has a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 capacity and flexibility of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.759
 to understand things is the will of 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 learn dominate right there is a spreadsheet 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.250
 well and eventually a bank of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.070
 given a presentation tool 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 is super important and has it up 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.540
 of all commitment 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.329
 but during the holidays the students 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.159
 have different foci 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 I intend to use the holidays now for 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.759
 give a respondent to see what they are 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 need the market to be able to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.010
 find an internship 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.680
 I think I 'm going to rest. 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.080
 year- round sought vacations 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.120
 resting is not leaving the fun of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.560
 but it is to go to new choices 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.660
 because I think vacations are a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.510
 great period you can search 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.940
 Stage rest a little too 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.190
 I understand that the university student studied 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.920
 Neon the person is looking for a vacancy 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.250
 there is also a request for her to rest and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.770
 relax a little more but it is as you 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.590
 she commits herself to a day in the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.780
 time of participating in a process 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.270
 Do not show up, it hurts. 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.410
 quite the life of the executive quite 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.230
 in there 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.960
 so those who take advantage of this phase 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.730
 watching the odds captures the best 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.250
 market experiences 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.630
 I think he has to have fun more 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.110
 he has to be committed if 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.420
 a career opportunity appears in the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.700
 life is a good opportunity for 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.700
 develop and can not ignore
