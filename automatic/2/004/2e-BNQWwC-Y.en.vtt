00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
tnt which is activated by pressure

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.979 
tnt which is activated by pressure
plates<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.770> nine<00:00:50.160> blocks<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.640> TNT

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
plates there will be nine blocks of TNT

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.510 
plates there will be nine blocks of TNT
right<00:00:51.989> next<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.010> cool<00:00:53.219> loot

which can be activated activated by the
pressure<00:00:56.610> plate<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.539> you're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
pressure plate that's in there so you're

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.330 
pressure plate that's in there so you're
going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> want<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.890> make<00:00:59.010> sure<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
going to want to make sure you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
there's some sand stone stairs inside

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
there's some sand stone stairs inside
there<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.210> we're<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.689> be

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
there as are so we're actually gonna be

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.010 
there as are so we're actually gonna be
getting<00:01:13.460> them<00:01:14.460> knew<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> blocks<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.840> well

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
getting them knew I blocks as well

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.149 
getting them knew I blocks as well
because<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.500> pretty<00:01:16.590> sure<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.890> didn't<00:01:17.040> get

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
because I'm pretty sure we didn't get

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100 
because I'm pretty sure we didn't get
them<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.369> title<00:01:17.700> update<00:01:17.850> 12<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> could

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
them in title update 12 I know you could

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
them in title update 12 I know you could
kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> glitch<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> glitter

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
kind of glitch them in with the glitter

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
kind of glitch them in with the glitter
I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.049> may<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.470> been<00:01:22.650> able

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I think you may have actually been able

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
I think you may have actually been able
to<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> creative<00:01:24.240> mode<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
to use them in creative mode or that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
to use them in creative mode or that
might<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.740> been<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.979> regular<00:01:26.490> chiseled

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
might have been just regular chiseled

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.390 
might have been just regular chiseled
block<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.450> yeah<00:01:27.900> either<00:01:28.829> way<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.250> be

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
block but yeah either way there will be

obviously there's no horses but yet that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
obviously there's no horses but yet that
means<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.099> will<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.459> getting<00:02:11.580> these<00:02:11.940> and

means that we will be getting these and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.900 
means that we will be getting these and
it<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.930> quite<00:02:13.110> similar<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.680> P

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
it will be quite similar to the P

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.850 
it will be quite similar to the P
version<00:02:14.270> I'm<00:02:14.600> presuming<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.590> apparently

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
version I'm presuming so apparently

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.410 
version I'm presuming so apparently
desert<00:02:16.370> temples<00:02:16.760> are<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.970> most<00:02:17.150> valuable

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
desert temples are the most valuable

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.690 
desert temples are the most valuable
structures<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.680> game<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.580> because

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
structures in the game this is because

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.940 
structures in the game this is because
there's<00:02:20.060> four<00:02:20.300> chests<00:02:20.630> filled<00:02:20.900> with<00:02:21.080> loot<00:02:21.380> the

sandstone to really could collect all of
this<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.360> build<00:02:29.840> some<00:02:29.960> kind<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.470> cool

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
this and build some kind of cool

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280 
this and build some kind of cool
structure<00:02:31.910> also<00:02:32.180> there's<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.810> nine<00:02:33.050> blocks

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
structure also there's the nine blocks

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.920 
structure also there's the nine blocks
of<00:02:33.440> TNT<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.070> can<00:02:34.250> get<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:35.600> know<00:02:35.750> is

of TNT that you can get so you know is
quite<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.530> quite<00:02:36.650> worthwhile<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.870> venture

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
quite it's quite worthwhile to venture

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.600 
quite it's quite worthwhile to venture
into<00:02:38.990> one<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.290> these<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.980> not<00:02:40.100> be<00:02:40.250> afraid<00:02:40.340> of
