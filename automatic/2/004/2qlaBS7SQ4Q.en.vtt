off-the-cuff comment said you know those
really<00:02:11.260> big<00:02:11.620> fat<00:02:12.010> pups<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.690> huge

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
really big fat pups that are just huge

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.980 
really big fat pups that are just huge
that<00:02:14.980> weaning<00:02:15.580> because<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.330> kind<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.750> think

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
that weaning because I kind of think

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.580 
that weaning because I kind of think
that<00:02:17.350> they're<00:02:17.920> probably<00:02:18.190> not<00:02:18.520> very<00:02:18.700> good<00:02:19.090> pups

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
that they're probably not very good pups

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.559 
that they're probably not very good pups
because<00:02:20.590> maybe<00:02:20.860> what<00:02:21.220> happened<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:22.060> those

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
because maybe what happened is those

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.479 
because maybe what happened is those
pups<00:02:22.870> never<00:02:23.200> went<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> water<00:02:23.860> during<00:02:24.370> that

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.860 
during that that critical period of time
in<00:02:39.580> their<00:02:39.700> life<00:02:39.910> where<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.630> have<00:02:40.780> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
in their life where they have the

seals from their mom in particular and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.449 
seals from their mom in particular and
so<00:02:46.569> they<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.900> laid<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.380> ice<00:02:47.530> fed<00:02:48.130> got

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
so they just laid on the ice fed got

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.550 
so they just laid on the ice fed got
really<00:02:48.790> fat<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.630> they<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.900> no<00:02:50.140> survival

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
really fat but they have no survival

really fat but they have no survival
skills<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.370> they<00:02:51.400> never<00:02:51.700> went<00:02:51.880> in<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
skills because they never went in the

skills because they never went in the

water but then in science you should

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.370 
water but then in science you should
