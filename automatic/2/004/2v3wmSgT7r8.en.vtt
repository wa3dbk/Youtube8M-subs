00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:03.685
 The picture was painted this week by four-year-old Shota. 

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:15.465
 what's your opinion about this photo? 

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.305
 He is a boy playing in the swimming pool. 

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.045
 It's Oompa-Loompa! Or a beetle. 

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.925
 What could this be? Pole boy? 

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:28.685
 This is boy friend. It makes waves in the pond. 

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:30.785
 - ant? - This is an ant! 

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:34.125
 This is a lake. You can swim friends. 

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.925
 I wonder what this is. a rock? 

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:38.485
 This is rice curry! 

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:43.125
 - I wonder if small frogs eat rice curry. - They do. 

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.850
 Looks delicious. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.785
 - This image is highly encrypted, can you draw it more clearly? - Certainly! 

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:31.525
 Please explain the picture to us! 

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:37.805
 Two boys were playing in the pool. 

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:42.385
 This here is the pond. 

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:47.245
 This boy came to play with his friend. 

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:50.085
 Does this boy not want to play with him? 

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:52.020
 No, he's happy. 

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:56.725
 - This one is still wearing his clothes and is about to join - "I'm coming!" 

00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.085
 This one here, is the swimming ring? 

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.065
 Yes it is. 

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:06.445
 There are so many things on his body ... 

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:09.385
 This is his shirt printing. 

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:16.325
 There are large rocks and a beetle cell and ants are sitting there to chat. 

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:24.125
 I created a setup for them to both watch the ocean while talking. 

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.045
 I look like a penguin but a tadpole. 

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:30.285
 A tadpaph who eats rice with curry. 

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.605
 But this blue curry rice! 

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:39.265
 The point here is ... what you call it .... eye shadow. 

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:41.385
 Wearing a yellow eye shadow. 

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:45.125
 - is she a girl? - Does not have sex. 

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:47.218
 Here's an ant. 

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.985
 She would like to eat curry as well. 

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:55.105
 This is a pool here. I do not know why 

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:59.345
 Where did the creep go? - Here. 

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:04.205
 It is water spray. 

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:10.345
 The answer is ... 

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:14.505
 This is the tadpole who left his house. 

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:17.825
 Ants that hatch just now. 

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:20.085
 this is very difficult. 

00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:23.325
 These are the whites - yes they are. 

00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:24.925
 I was so wrong! 

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:30.725
 I need a more pure heart to understand this picture. 

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:38.685
 Wonderful, this is fantastic. I did not think they were white. 

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.665
 Does this mean that the person is cracked? 

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:46.645
 You painted the crack on the stone. No, this is not a fault is an ant fingerprint. 

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:50.465
 - It did so really well. - I am a bit disappointed. 

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.405
 Wonderful! I'm absolutely right! 

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:56.245
 But the face looked as if they were eating. 

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:58.825
 The lake was wrong. 

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.525
 I may be a genius. 

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:03.345
 This is an ant. Well done to me! 

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:06.065
 The minds of the children are beautiful. 

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:15.745
 Mister Minamami! Can you analyze current graphics? 

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:16.665
 I understand. 

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:19.605
 The painter of these pictures likes Chibi Maruko-chan ?! 

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:23.865
 Hair looks like her. Maybe this person already has children. 

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:29.145
 This is not about the painter. The painter wants children to have fun. 

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:30.545
 A warm picture 

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:37.705
 It seems to have a story. In the ocean and ... for some unknown reason there is an ant and a beetle. 

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.705
 There is another ant here. 

00:04:39.705 --> 00:04:44.485
 There is a yacht or boat in the ocean. 

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:51.145
 Are these crows or seagulls? Have they come for a walk? 

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.005
 They seem to sing. 

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:56.905
 I think this is an ant ... or a ghost? 

00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:59.965
 The Jacket Potato Ghost. 

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.545
 Are these potatoes? - Yes it is. 

00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:05.465
 This is the ghost header. 

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:08.745
 Is this supposed to be an ant? 

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:12.585
 It also looks like a cricket game. Maybe they are married. 

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:14.365
 This is catfish. 

00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.033
 They seem to be eating. 

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:20.545
 They are both relaxed and have fun. 

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:23.385
 What was the general theme of these four images? 

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:27.845
 I think this is the summer vacation. 

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:36.705
 The theme of the day is: summer holidays! 

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:43.465
 The theme of the day is: summer holidays!
