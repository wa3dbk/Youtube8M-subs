00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
when they know the facts and sit there

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.710 
when they know the facts and sit there
and<00:03:47.280> think<00:03:47.340> about<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.760> logically<00:03:48.209> instead<00:03:48.600> of

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
and think about it logically instead of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.740 
and think about it logically instead of
oh<00:03:49.040> look<00:03:50.040> at<00:03:50.220> wolves<00:03:50.610> oh<00:03:50.760> that's<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.540> same

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
oh look at wolves oh that's the same

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.260 
oh look at wolves oh that's the same
thing<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:52.440> asking<00:03:52.800> that<00:03:52.980> question<00:03:53.270> don't

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
thing that's asking that question don't

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.850 
thing that's asking that question don't
make<00:03:54.420> sense<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.989> think<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.500> should<00:03:55.680> think

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
make sense I think you should think

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.310 
make sense I think you should think
about<00:03:56.070> what<00:03:56.370> you're<00:03:56.550> asking<00:03:56.880> me<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.209> little<00:03:58.140> bit

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
about what you're asking me a little bit

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.530 
about what you're asking me a little bit
more<00:03:58.560> because<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:59.310> not<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.700> same<00:03:59.910> scenario

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
more because it's not the same scenario

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.989 
more because it's not the same scenario
so
