00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.290
 sascha for mobile giggs I'm up 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.170
 see the acer event in new york 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.759
 Can you still have something going on 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.769
 and I have mine here right now 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.650
 eyes the most exciting device caught 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:23.260
 and that is the esa is at switch 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:28.520
 10 looks like netbook 10 inch 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.980
 form factor psp 13 66 x 768 is the 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.890
 resolution but just exciting 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.230
 it is partly from device and in the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.650
 Great for a great year 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.330
 competitor for the transformer t 100 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.670
 and I believe even one moment 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.930
 to put municipal space has in 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.180
 in a certain way also the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.550
 nose in front let us first about the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.190
 specification so talk about 10.1 in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.950
 strip 6 16 28 60 is the resolution 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.380
 The box is based on the internet 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.030
 herbert trail and that is currently 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.880
 37 45 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.470
 that means she gets an x86 quad here 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:11.200
 core with 1 3 ghz and 1 33 ghz exactly 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.270
 but he can overclock until 183 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.400
 casting has a lot of bums in general 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.680
 if you compare the beachfield with 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.780
 a core i5 from two and a half years ago 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.729
 then it's faster and faster 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.290
 I think that's a performance that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.880
 internet from creek has and that through 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.799
 is simply extremely cheap device 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.619
 might look now otherwise 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.540
 Two gigabytes of RAM are built in and 32 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.880
 or 64 gigabytes of flash memory 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.920
 depending on which variant gets but 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.470
 it will probably be a variant with 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.909
 give a rake in the docking station 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.040
 and there recognizes a bit yes 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.689
 we want the box opposite the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 company he offered 100 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.830
 position windows 8.1 is 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.810
 pre-installed you can see that 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.130
 not over switche on the people 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.659
 Of course , here is one too 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.299
 corresponding multi touch screen 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.220
 it's all pretty nice 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.820
 as far as he is with 2 megapixel camera here 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.270
 ahead 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.810
 the tablet itself, like 585, will be the same 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.550
 take off and the docking station to about 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.310
 110 112 kilo so altogether even 17 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.410
 the keyboard we could see one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.120
 nice and very generous chiclet 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.940
 keyboard and even if I have now 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.140
 right on you push that you see that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.880
 offers up here a bit 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 but not on the keyboard 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.230
 By the way, I like the big shift button 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.270
 on the right and on the left side 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.150
 that's for scribblers i think 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.310
 then you have a big multitouch 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.550
 trackpad course then with the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.730
 integrated mouse keys accordingly there 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.660
 otherwise let's get into it 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.220
 of course, has looked around 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.690
 still the tablet in the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.700
 docking station in it but we leave that 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.530
 synonymous first so connection before headset 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.660
 on and off switch here and there the 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.890
 volume control then in the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.590
 docking station we have here now 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.020
 nothing great here on the side at 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.080
 usb 2 0 port micro sd cards 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.360
 the microphone has faster 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.760
 then we have micro-usb in hdmi output 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.380
 and a connection accordingly for the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.780
 charger and that was it actually 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.820
 already which means I need you now 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.930
 times the functionality show that is 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.959
 now so very classic per 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.370
 laptop or pinch shell or netbook 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.440
 Fashion however he wants to call it 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.560
 but then it will be exciting again 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.640
 have with one hand 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.390
 very briefly opened again 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.190
 company where you are here from the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.870
 docking station from what here all 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.670
 Practically, they have me really strong 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.590
 magnets underneath which you baked too 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.319
 really something we always put it that way 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.910
 go close 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.319
 So the locks immediately to which they have 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.720
 really great 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.940
 You can then take the whole thing and 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.489
 could turn that around and as if I had 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.860
 something said it was there that already noticed 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.430
 I'm really easy with this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.170
 wanting to switch to the 104 is extremely why 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.360
 then you have this so-called media 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.690
 Mode which is convenient because you 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.560
 have the victory here also from speakers 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.970
 Listen pretty well 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.330
 maybe we would be there too 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.430
 have a short send somewhere 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.450
 video on it you already see 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.880
 Of course I'm sensational 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:22.310
 prepared video video what about 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.310
 music and we take it out music 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.910
 photo collections, therefore, nothing on it 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.890
 then we have 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.890
 what's going on here now 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.550
 I 'll probably have to first 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.530
 log in somewhere okay that was the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.390
 famous set with ex but also that 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.060
 test play 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.370
 if we really do that then 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.740
 so get from facing speakers that 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.440
 is so called median mode then 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.810
 But there is still one of the e-mail is a 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.700
 little different renault yoga or 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.650
 Just check accordingly 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.540
 putting it down is very practical 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.700
 could be from your plane if he 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.700
 economy on the road could be the time in the 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.600
 pack your bag in front of you in front of you 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.990
 have basically taken 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.420
 in the small own media center with am 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.220
 start so is almost in the wrong 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.090
 reborn that direction again 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.290
 be beautiful 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.960
 I try that too 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.040
 to dismiss again and shows again how 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.169
 just that's possible 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.779
 Danger 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.219
 immediately locks a very very nice 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:36.099
 Of course, what are you doing now? 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:38.469
 ask is what does it cost all the fun here 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.310
 is 3 79 us dollar I go of it 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:44.889
 from 379 euros that means for 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.129
 you in germany that's a first 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.960
 Hands on with the new Acer Aspire 16 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.909
 i am still sascha gies if 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.099
 you have questions down here in the 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.020
 comments purely if something completely 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.449
 want special knowledge or so then 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.999
 let me know otherwise 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.110
 the device clips the video clips and 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.389
 if our channel is not yet 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.889
 Subscribed up there in the corner could 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.050
 do that so that we can in future 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.360
 always up to date and in part 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.009
