00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
down the painters tape there's still a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
down the painters tape there's still a
fair<00:01:02.579> chance<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> paint<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.710> to

fair chance that the paint is going to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280

bleed<00:01:05.070> underneath<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.729> tape<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
bleed underneath that tape because of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.580 
bleed underneath that tape because of
the<00:01:07.610> texture<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.970> wall<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.260> trick

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the texture on the wall so a good trick

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130 
the texture on the wall so a good trick
is<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> use<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.090> regular<00:01:12.450> caulk<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is to use a just a regular caulk you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
is to use a just a regular caulk you
want<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> make<00:01:13.500> sure<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> paintable

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
caulk and you're going to put a small

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
caulk and you're going to put a small
bead<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.270> along<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> edge

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
bead of that right along the edge

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.060 
bead of that right along the edge
of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.650> tape<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.290> just<00:01:22.290> follow<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.830> right

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
of the tape and you just follow it right

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.999 
of the tape and you just follow it right
down<00:01:23.900> stop<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.320> before<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> end

down stop a little bit before the end
and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:26.880> finger<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
and then just take your finger and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
smooth that caulk right along the edge

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
smooth that caulk right along the edge
of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.210> tape<00:01:35.479> what<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.110> is

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
of the tape what that's going to do is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
of the tape what that's going to do is
it's<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> create<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.950> seal<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:39.180> along

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it's going to create a seal right along

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.910 
it's going to create a seal right along
the<00:01:39.570> edge<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> tape<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.470> might<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the edge of the tape you might want to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730 
the edge of the tape you might want to
have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> damp<00:01:41.400> rag<00:01:41.670> handy<00:01:42.030> too<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.500> go

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have a damp rag handy too so you can go

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.789 
have a damp rag handy too so you can go
right<00:01:43.770> along<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> rag<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.649> want

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
right along it there with a rag you want

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.870 
right along it there with a rag you want
to<00:01:46.890> make<00:01:47.009> sure<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.399> any<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> excess

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to make sure you get any of the excess

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
to make sure you get any of the excess
caulk<00:01:48.630> away<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.040> change<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
caulk away so you don't change the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600 
caulk away so you don't change the
texture<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> wall<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.189> about

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.609 
paint now there are some more
sophisticated<00:02:02.969> kinds<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.360> tape<00:02:03.619> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
sophisticated kinds of tape this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.770 
sophisticated kinds of tape this
particular<00:02:04.979> tape<00:02:05.460> actually<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.149> impregnated

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
particular tape actually is impregnated

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.719 
particular tape actually is impregnated
with<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.110> chemical<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.250> will<00:02:08.429> immediately

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
with a chemical that will immediately

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.820 
with a chemical that will immediately
absorb<00:02:09.509> any<00:02:09.720> liquid<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.319> goes<00:02:10.500> underneath

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
absorb any liquid that goes underneath

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.640 
absorb any liquid that goes underneath
it<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.180> tape<00:02:12.450> will<00:02:12.870> allow<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.410> get

first color that you're painting or your

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
first color that you're painting or your
first<00:03:09.959> Sheen<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.290> you're<00:03:10.560> painting<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:11.400> can

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
first Sheen that you're painting you can

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
first Sheen that you're painting you can
remove<00:03:12.060> your<00:03:12.269> tape<00:03:12.450> immediately<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.350> let's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
remove your tape immediately so let's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.979 
remove your tape immediately so let's
see<00:03:13.799> what<00:03:14.010> happens<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:15.269> use<00:03:15.450> two<00:03:15.660> different

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
see what happens we use two different

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.380 
see what happens we use two different
kinds<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.290> tapes<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.860> very<00:03:17.489> textured<00:03:18.120> wall

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
kinds of tapes on a very textured wall

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.930 
kinds of tapes on a very textured wall
so<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.079> tape<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.220> impregnated

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so this is a tape that is impregnated

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.360 
so this is a tape that is impregnated
with<00:03:21.060> chemicals<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:22.230> absorb<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.040> extra

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
with chemicals that absorb the extra

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.220 
with chemicals that absorb the extra
paint<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.540> see<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.810> got<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.989> nice

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
paint and you can see we got a nice

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.660 
paint and you can see we got a nice
clean<00:03:25.620> line<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.989> side<00:03:27.989> we<00:03:28.230> used<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.829> more

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
clean line and this side we used a more

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.610 
clean line and this side we used a more
traditional<00:03:29.880> blue<00:03:30.720> painters<00:03:31.109> tape<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.560> we

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
traditional blue painters tape but we

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.910 
traditional blue painters tape but we
used<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.280> caulk<00:03:32.519> stripe<00:03:32.880> along<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.359> edge<00:03:33.920> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
used a caulk stripe along the edge and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.530 
used a caulk stripe along the edge and
you<00:03:35.100> see<00:03:35.280> we<00:03:35.400> actually<00:03:35.760> even<00:03:35.910> got<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.180> better

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
you see we actually even got a better

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440 
you see we actually even got a better
line<00:03:36.840> using<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.980> regular<00:03:38.549> painters<00:03:39.239> tape

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
line using the regular painters tape

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.210 
line using the regular painters tape
with<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.140> bit<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.500> caulk<00:03:40.739> along<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
with that little bit of caulk along the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.210 
with that little bit of caulk along the
edge<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.489> can<00:03:41.549> see<00:03:41.640> how<00:03:41.850> sharp<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.329> line<00:03:42.780> is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
edge you can see how sharp that line is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.710 
edge you can see how sharp that line is
when<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.340> do<00:03:44.489> your<00:03:44.519> second<00:03:45.060> color<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.540> want
