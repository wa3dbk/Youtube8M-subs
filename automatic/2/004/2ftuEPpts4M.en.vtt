the<00:00:22.949> Afro<00:00:23.460> League<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.210> we've<00:00:24.779> got<00:00:24.990> three

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the Afro League and we've got three

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.460 
the Afro League and we've got three
seasons<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.820> them<00:00:26.939> except<00:00:27.390> from<00:00:27.750> ps3

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
seasons on all of them except from ps3

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.820 
seasons on all of them except from ps3
which<00:00:29.039> didn't<00:00:29.400> exactly<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> plan<00:00:30.109> but<00:00:31.109> I'm

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
which didn't exactly go to plan but I'm

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
which didn't exactly go to plan but I'm
really<00:00:32.070> thinking<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.489> f1<00:00:32.850> 2014<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
really thinking about f1 2014 and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780 
really thinking about f1 2014 and
possibly<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.739> able<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> league<00:00:35.370> but

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
possibly be able to do a league but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.970 
possibly be able to do a league but
there<00:00:36.600> are<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.809> couple<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.170> reasons<00:00:37.559> why<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
there are a couple of reasons why I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.319 
there are a couple of reasons why I
really<00:00:38.520> want<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> league<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> then

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
really want to do a league and then

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.139 
really want to do a league and then
other<00:00:39.480> reasons<00:00:39.780> why<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.790> reasons

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
other reasons why don't and the reasons

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.790 
other reasons why don't and the reasons
obviously<00:00:42.239> why<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.899> obviously<00:00:43.530> got<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
obviously why I do is obviously got a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.080 
obviously why I do is obviously got a
great<00:00:44.040> community<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> lots<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.850> great

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
great community and lots of great

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.180 
great community and lots of great
drivers<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.780> it'd<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.050> nice<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> hold<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.039> league

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
drivers so it'd be nice to hold a league

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.900 
drivers so it'd be nice to hold a league
again<00:00:47.850> obviously<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> new<00:00:49.079> game<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.910> also

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
again obviously on the new game and also

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.580 
again obviously on the new game and also
I'm<00:00:51.390> thinking<00:00:51.780> maybe<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.230> changing

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm thinking maybe we just changing

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
I'm thinking maybe we just changing
around<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> time<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.430> better<00:00:53.910> for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
around the time so it's better for

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
around the time so it's better for
everyone<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:55.230> hopefully<00:00:55.800> better<00:00:55.920> for

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
everyone or hopefully better for

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.209 
everyone or hopefully better for
everyone<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:57.289> well<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.829> hopefully

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
everyone because well and all hopefully

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.319 
everyone because well and all hopefully
better<00:00:59.340> from<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.820> well<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.180> because

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
better from here as well just because

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.660 
better from here as well just because
maybe<00:01:00.690> ever<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> Thursday<00:01:01.739> won't<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.520> too

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
maybe ever got the Thursday won't be too

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
maybe ever got the Thursday won't be too
good<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:03.180> anymore<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.890> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
good for me anymore but I think you know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.320 
good for me anymore but I think you know
for<00:01:05.220> example<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.640> xbox<00:01:05.970> league<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
for example the xbox league on a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.570 
for example the xbox league on a
thursday<00:01:06.659> should<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.960> said<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:08.250> i'm<00:01:08.400> really

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
thursday should have said but i'm really

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.630 
thursday should have said but i'm really
hoping<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.080> i<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.340> running

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
hoping that the i can get up and running

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.320 
hoping that the i can get up and running
a<00:01:11.790> league<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.780> f1<00:01:13.110> 2014<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> my<00:01:14.820> guess<00:01:14.880> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
a league for f1 2014 and my guess it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
a league for f1 2014 and my guess it's
going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.810> next-gen<00:01:16.439> versions<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
going to be on next-gen versions now I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
going to be on next-gen versions now I
haven't<00:01:18.030> got<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.210> xbox<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.350> i<00:01:19.650> might

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
haven't got an xbox one but i might

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
haven't got an xbox one but i might
invest<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.030> some<00:01:21.240> point<00:01:21.450> before<00:01:21.600> f<00:01:22.140> 1

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
invest in one at some point before f 1

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090 
invest in one at some point before f 1
2014<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.460> released<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.290> thinking<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
2014 is released so my my thinking is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
2014 is released so my my thinking is
evil<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.610> Saturday<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.210> Sunday<00:01:27.240> running<00:01:28.020> for

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
evil on Saturday or Sunday running for

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
evil on Saturday or Sunday running for
example<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> pc<00:01:29.640> league<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:29.970> seven<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.689> xbox

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
example the pc league at seven the xbox

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.920 
example the pc league at seven the xbox
one<00:01:31.500> league<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> ps4<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.750> nine

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
one league a then the ps4 you get nine

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.770 
one league a then the ps4 you get nine
now<00:01:34.290> i'm<00:01:34.950> most<00:01:35.369> likely<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.360> sticking

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
now i'm most likely going to be sticking

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
now i'm most likely going to be sticking
to<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> next<00:01:37.259> gen<00:01:37.439> consoles<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.430> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to the next gen consoles if it is you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.039 
to the next gen consoles if it is you
know<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.060> released<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> linux<00:01:39.900> gen

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
know if it is released on linux gen

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
know if it is released on linux gen
consoles<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.549> be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
consoles that's what I'm gonna be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
consoles that's what I'm gonna be
focusing<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.479> because<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.619> i

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
focusing on just because that's where i

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.440 
focusing on just because that's where i
think<00:01:44.159> i'm<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> play<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:44.880> might<00:01:45.180> even

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
think i'm going to play i might even

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.469 
think i'm going to play i might even
have<00:01:45.600> my<00:01:45.810> xbox<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.380> ps3<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.189> point<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have my xbox or ps3 at that point so you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
have my xbox or ps3 at that point so you
know<00:01:48.600> i'm<00:01:48.689> i'm<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.549> probably

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
know i'm i'm going to be probably

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
know i'm i'm going to be probably
sticking<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.270> those<00:01:51.329> next<00:01:51.720> gen<00:01:51.899> consoles<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
sticking to those next gen consoles to
do<00:01:53.640> these<00:01:53.820> leagues<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.990> isn't<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
do these leagues but if there isn't a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
do these leagues but if there isn't a
huge<00:01:55.500> amount<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.799> interesting<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> next<00:01:56.700> gen

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
huge amount of interesting the next gen

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.069 
huge amount of interesting the next gen
leagues<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.360> I'll<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> think

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
leagues then I'll have to think

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.450 
leagues then I'll have to think
otherwise<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.070> i'm<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> do

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
otherwise about what i'm going to do

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.420 
otherwise about what i'm going to do
with<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.159> video

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
with it but really I'm just this video

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
with it but really I'm just this video
is<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.579> asking<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.360> intrested<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
is just asking with your intrested it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.190 
is just asking with your intrested it
may<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.110> joining<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:05.310> f1<00:02:05.670> league<00:02:06.049> at<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
may be joining an f1 league at the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380 
may be joining an f1 league at the
moment<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.619> will<00:02:07.710> only<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.220> tiered<00:02:08.580> tier

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
moment it will only be one tiered tier

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.720 
moment it will only be one tiered tier
one<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.709> those<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
one all of those and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.059 
one all of those and
what<00:02:12.300> I'd<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.540> probably<00:02:12.810> doing<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.620> sort<00:02:14.040> of

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
what I'd be probably doing is a sort of

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.259 
what I'd be probably doing is a sort of
a<00:02:14.159> thorough<00:02:14.370> procedure<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.599> f1<00:02:15.780> 2013<00:02:16.290> on

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
a thorough procedure on like f1 2013 on

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.430 
a thorough procedure on like f1 2013 on
drivers<00:02:18.269> killing<00:02:18.569> everything<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.230> in

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
drivers killing everything because in

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.199 
drivers killing everything because in
the<00:02:19.890> past<00:02:20.069> we've<00:02:20.430> had<00:02:20.459> some<00:02:20.760> problems<00:02:21.090> were

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the past we've had some problems were

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.600 
the past we've had some problems were
just<00:02:21.390> letting<00:02:21.900> people<00:02:22.230> race<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.769> by<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.519> time

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
just letting people race and by the time

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
just letting people race and by the time
they<00:02:24.060> actually<00:02:24.269> get<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.480> league<00:02:24.840> even<00:02:25.709> people

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
they actually get the league even people

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.030 
they actually get the league even people
don't<00:02:26.069> show<00:02:26.159> up<00:02:26.640> or<00:02:27.019> they<00:02:28.019> aren't<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:28.830> good<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
don't show up or they aren't as good a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.580 
don't show up or they aren't as good a
driver<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.489> we<00:02:29.910> had<00:02:30.000> expected<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.720> probably<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
driver as we had expected so probably a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.850 
driver as we had expected so probably a
thorough<00:02:31.860> procedure<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:33.180> 2013<00:02:34.140> lobby<00:02:34.560> trying

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
thorough procedure in 2013 lobby trying

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.199 
thorough procedure in 2013 lobby trying
to<00:02:35.040> make<00:02:35.250> sure<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.459> get<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.670> best<00:02:35.849> drivers

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
to make sure we get the best drivers

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.930 
to make sure we get the best drivers
possible<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:37.500> also<00:02:37.620> catering<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.519> all<00:02:38.640> skill

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
possible but also catering for all skill

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.210 
possible but also catering for all skill
levels<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> f<00:02:40.140> rly<00:02:40.410> has<00:02:40.560> always

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
levels that's what the f rly has always

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.559 
levels that's what the f rly has always
been<00:02:41.370> about<00:02:41.640> there's<00:02:41.940> always<00:02:42.180> been<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.360> good

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
been about there's always been a good

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.390 
been about there's always been a good
battle<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.230> ten<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.799> championship

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
battle for like ten to the championship

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.190 
battle for like ten to the championship
for<00:02:44.549> example<00:02:44.970> has<00:02:45.599> always<00:02:45.840> been<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.019> good

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
for example has always been a good

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.930 
for example has always been a good
battle<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.709> overall<00:02:47.010> championship<00:02:47.519> so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
battle for the overall championship so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
battle for the overall championship so
that's<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.720> aim<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.140> make<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> close

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
that's my aim is to make a close

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.530 
that's my aim is to make a close
championship<00:02:49.859> throughout<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.849> think

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
championship throughout I think

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780 
championship throughout I think
generally<00:02:52.049> we<00:02:52.410> succeeded<00:02:52.950> with<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.459> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
generally we succeeded with that on the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.770 
generally we succeeded with that on the
xbox<00:02:54.690> 360<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.349> PC<00:02:55.920> sadly<00:02:56.790> ps3<00:02:57.329> never<00:02:57.510> went<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
xbox 360 and PC sadly ps3 never went to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.319 
xbox 360 and PC sadly ps3 never went to

Planned obviously a big thanks to Cal HD
and<00:03:00.450> high<00:03:00.540> products<00:03:00.870> which<00:03:00.989> they<00:03:01.560> really<00:03:01.859> did

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and high products which they really did

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.039 
and high products which they really did
try<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.340> make<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.489> work<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:03.049> unfortunately

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
try and make it work but unfortunately

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.830 
try and make it work but unfortunately
just<00:03:04.230> sort<00:03:04.379> of<00:03:04.410> didn't<00:03:04.790> 2013<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:05.940> ps3<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.569> maybe

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
just sort of didn't 2013 on ps3 so maybe

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.110 
just sort of didn't 2013 on ps3 so maybe
was<00:03:06.989> not<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:07.709> what<00:03:08.040> people<00:03:08.340> expected<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.910> still

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
was not as what people expected it still

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.110 
was not as what people expected it still
wasn't<00:03:09.329> exactly<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.290> best<00:03:11.120> because

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
wasn't exactly the best because

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
wasn't exactly the best because
obviously<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.599> i<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.620> 2012<00:03:14.099> we<00:03:14.280> just

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
obviously it's i think in 2012 we just

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.339 
obviously it's i think in 2012 we just
had<00:03:14.549> that<00:03:14.640> there<00:03:14.879> was<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.540> know<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.810> ps3<00:03:16.230> was

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
had that there was you know the ps3 was

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.819 
had that there was you know the ps3 was
a<00:03:16.380> bad<00:03:16.590> poor<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.299> 23<00:03:18.299> 2013<00:03:19.139> really<00:03:19.500> wasn't<00:03:19.769> a

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
a bad poor and 23 2013 really wasn't a

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.740 
a bad poor and 23 2013 really wasn't a
huge<00:03:20.010> round<00:03:20.160> better<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> ps3<00:03:21.389> side<00:03:21.599> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
huge round better so the ps3 side of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.150 
huge round better so the ps3 side of
things<00:03:21.989> with<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> PlayStation<00:03:22.769> sightings

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
things with the PlayStation sightings

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.789 
things with the PlayStation sightings
sadly<00:03:24.090> hasn't<00:03:24.359> been<00:03:24.480> really<00:03:25.109> that<00:03:25.290> great<00:03:25.560> over

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
sadly hasn't been really that great over

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.020 
sadly hasn't been really that great over
the<00:03:25.950> last<00:03:26.069> couple<00:03:26.250> years<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.730> I'm<00:03:26.819> really

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
the last couple years so I'm really

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.430 
the last couple years so I'm really
hoping<00:03:27.269> they'll<00:03:27.599> improved<00:03:27.989> there<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
hoping they'll improved there and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.039 
hoping they'll improved there and
closely<00:03:29.370> I've<00:03:29.760> got<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.000> ps4<00:03:30.239> now<00:03:30.569> I've<00:03:30.780> got<00:03:30.959> an

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
closely I've got a ps4 now I've got an

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.830 
closely I've got a ps4 now I've got an
Xbox<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:31.769> still<00:03:31.980> hoping<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.819> but<00:03:33.269> you

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
Xbox I'm still hoping for that but you
