00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.420
 hello to all of you pretty tasty 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.570
 so today we find ourselves for a new video today I 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.989
 will show you how 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.559
 to make a trap continue 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.529
 like this one 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.649
 let's imagine it's a diamond block 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:19.859
 you put% a dummy house do not go back did not come in and of course 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.639
 the person may be curious as anyone 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.589
 and will still come in 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.089
 we say it's the block 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.589
 they want to break 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.329
 and everything but like these 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.400
 and of course so die 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.770
 so how did I change hands in paris 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.870
 huetthaler on this map as well 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.220
 mamadou diouf would have liked tutor 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.570
 so it's very simple 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.100
 all you dig a hole for me I dug a hole like that because 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.030
 I did not want to advertise 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.050
 I'm more welcome I'm going rather united do not know but no I 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 the beloved groland 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.800
 or else of leoty a necessary imagine diamond blomme 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.020
 sticky pistol 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.280
 in the backstages 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 blackstone 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770
 carpeting 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 to show you well 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.260
 according to a moving a mole 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
 so here you put 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.130
 the blocks kevin the person will break choice 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.200
 you are 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 sticky pistons 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.920
 so always to enter it must be before 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 a withdrawal plan 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.150
 Here or somewhere else 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.050
 as you can see from the tested toy bumper set on a 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.090
 complaint of fbi I started expressed there I will test and it's really good 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.170
 convenient me I say I advise you to install 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 here you go put your carpet 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.340
 your carpet 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 nevertheless the judge but the lmr 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.930
 the trestles 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.850
 you show how it works well but after you go not because it makes me 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.359
 normally the trap is that the person 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.689
 probably not that it's a trap 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.939
 you wish alain thorzain is stable 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.489
 as a society 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.299
 likewise the man of the earth 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 alarmed scanned 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.679
 douala and you rally 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.679
 ap ap ap 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.339
 the other side 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.049
 it's a father 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.539
 to make a trap 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:55.019
 very fast in Rome we see the mud covers everything all you do in 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:55.819
 withdrawal 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.839
 there nobody has happened to you 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.839
 a skin a cave of lugny cage 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.739
 did not come back from travel lately of course you need the person back 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.359
 she's going to want to break so 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.899
 it's this simulator block that the end 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.689
 so lifting up imagine we'll take it right away 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.929
 we will do that 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.929
 clear 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.909
 so the genius fashion 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.709
 you want I'm fellin homo 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.489
 not to die but otherwise you have understood the principle after 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.869
 it's very easy the best 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.869
 groupon put back your blocks 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.209
 - put a torch 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.359
 the tricky 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.359
 it was still accessible we actually 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.500
 to see her again and see you soon for new cities and then 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.170
 relative
