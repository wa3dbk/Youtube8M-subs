the phone it will always touch one of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.399 
the phone it will always touch one of
the<00:01:58.860> corners<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.490> that<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.420> hard<00:02:00.810> cases<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the corners or that the hard cases of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
the corners or that the hard cases of
which<00:02:01.979> adds<00:02:02.220> grey<00:02:03.180> our<00:02:03.329> protection<00:02:05.180> let's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
which adds grey our protection let's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
which adds grey our protection let's
just<00:02:06.240> fit<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.630> I'll<00:02:06.810> show<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.890> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
just fit it and I'll show you so you can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.780 
just fit it and I'll show you so you can
just<00:02:08.040> tuck<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.750> first<00:02:10.400> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.519> see<00:02:11.670> if

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
just tuck this in first you can see if

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.199 
just tuck this in first you can see if
it's<00:02:12.000> very<00:02:12.239> easily<00:02:12.480> covers<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.060> edges<00:02:15.060> up

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
it's very easily covers all the edges up

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.180 
it's very easily covers all the edges up
so<00:02:16.049> when<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.380> drop<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.820> still<00:02:18.030> got<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.329> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
so when you drop it you still got this a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.530 
so when you drop it you still got this a
silicon<00:02:20.190> case

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
silicon case

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.030 
silicon case
protect<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.140> then<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.439> push<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.769> into<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
protect it and then you push it into the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.339 
protect it and then you push it into the
hard<00:02:22.849> case<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.629> can<00:02:23.900> be<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:24.049> little<00:02:24.230> bit

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
hard case this can be a little bit

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.130 
hard case this can be a little bit
difficult<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.890> get<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.390> have<00:02:26.689> to<00:02:26.810> kind<00:02:26.959> of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
difficult to get in you have to kind of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.899 
difficult to get in you have to kind of
force<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.129> a<00:02:28.219> little<00:02:28.430> bit<00:02:29.439> and<00:02:30.879> make<00:02:31.879> sure

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
force it in a little bit and make sure

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.050 
force it in a little bit and make sure
all<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.269> buttons<00:02:32.540> are<00:02:32.750> out<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:34.280> once<00:02:34.549> once
