00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.000
 video and today it's about the new one 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.000
 snapshot 13b 43a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 new in this snapshots are the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.449
 Saplings for the new trees here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 Also, these were added once 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.169
 gets org sampling and acacia 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.189
 sampling or ok yes no matter acacia 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.769
 Baumeister in any case 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 and now you can be quite normal with 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.600
 to grow bone meal like to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 for example the acacia tree and here the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.739
 republic of the chambers, however, now 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 not so individually grow but 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.409
 you have to arrange like a tropical wood from 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.519
 stanzas baumann arrange around the whole 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.439
 to grow here 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.939
 the leaves are these new trees 

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:56.790
 of course in creative inventory too 

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:59.040
 find and you can not optically 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.809
 between oak leaves and new trees 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.640
 differ because it is exactly that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.290
 same texture you can see here that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.650
 they are exactly alike and they are still 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 different blocks as well 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 the glass is a bit better 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.259
 made here and indeed you can like the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 normal glass the back side so the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.320
 here through the glass no longer edges 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.270
 we'll just see each other here 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.939
 nothing more nor no black strokes 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.840
 with you this colorful glass and yes me 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.539
 just find it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.569
 yes it is better than the previous one and 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.429
 yes maybe I'm really cool 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.569
 it also wants a new command and that 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.600
 the set world of comment so you can 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.939
 just like the whole already says the spot 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 from the whole world we would have one 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.759
 Plug-in casserole servers 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.880
 do you just enter gold spot that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.200
 I wanted here now heard then will 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.420
 I'll spawn here again 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.219
 here about 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.340
 and if I now for example there 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.310
 go up on this hill or into the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.950
 pons and then I should stop again 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 here on the hill on it yes find that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.670
 I really cool and you needed it 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.979
 also no plugins or more 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.970
 this is my coal renewal a few 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.280
 old ones have been around again 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.220
 translated and indeed there are now 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.950
 the flowers here in german that is the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.010
 moon that is blue idea star race 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.959
 Marguerite and the puffer fish the new one 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.740
 texture has gotten now synonymous 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.220
 spines and 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.960
 face and actually better at 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.670
 The music was also changed and 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.380
 although if you recharge the world here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.570
 It may be that the music immediately 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.000
 if you start then in the menu 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.860
 then the music stops and you stop 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.710
 can continue playing and the music again 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.720
 So that's what the music is all about 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.020
 just only if the game is actively open 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.580
 is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.080
 if you liked the video 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 Of course I am happy about a like 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.530
 and if he has more of this stuff here 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 then subscribe but this channel 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.830
 and then I would say until the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.830
 next video and watch
