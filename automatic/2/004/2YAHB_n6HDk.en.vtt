00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
five to sixty thousand dollars per coin

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.170 
five to sixty thousand dollars per coin
well<00:02:11.680> we<00:02:11.980> always<00:02:12.280> bring<00:02:12.459> cool<00:02:12.640> coins<00:02:12.970> but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
well we always bring cool coins but

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.380 
well we always bring cool coins but
today<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.690> have<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> 1921<00:02:14.700> Morgan<00:02:15.700> dollar<00:02:15.940> which

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
today we have a 1921 Morgan dollar which

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.470 
today we have a 1921 Morgan dollar which
is<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.810> most<00:02:17.140> common<00:02:17.680> Morgan<00:02:18.519> dollar<00:02:18.730> they

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
is the most common Morgan dollar they

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.330 
is the most common Morgan dollar they
made<00:02:19.660> huge<00:02:20.019> quantities<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> these<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.190> think

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
made huge quantities of these I think

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.150 
made huge quantities of these I think
over<00:02:21.730> 20<00:02:22.000> million<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> them<00:02:22.739> however<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.980> is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
over 20 million of them however this is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.910 
over 20 million of them however this is
actually<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.760> coin<00:02:25.330> that's<00:02:25.570> in<00:02:25.780> 64<00:02:26.470> deep<00:02:26.680> mirror

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
actually a coin that's in 64 deep mirror

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.640 
actually a coin that's in 64 deep mirror
proof<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:28.720> actually<00:02:29.080> very<00:02:29.290> scarce

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
proof like and it's actually very scarce

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.680 
proof like and it's actually very scarce
so<00:02:29.890> despite<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.489> fact<00:02:30.760> they<00:02:30.880> made<00:02:31.060> millions

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
so despite the fact they made millions

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.110 
so despite the fact they made millions
there's<00:02:32.440> actually<00:02:32.920> less<00:02:33.250> than<00:02:33.310> 15<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.090> been

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
there's actually less than 15 have been

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120 
there's actually less than 15 have been
certified<00:02:34.600> deep<00:02:34.810> mirror<00:02:34.989> proof<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.380> by<00:02:35.530> PCGS

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
certified deep mirror proof like by PCGS

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.009 
certified deep mirror proof like by PCGS
and<00:02:36.549> there's<00:02:37.150> only<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.329> coin<00:02:37.780> actually

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
and there's only one coin actually

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.560 
and there's only one coin actually
higher<00:02:38.350> grade<00:02:38.680> than<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.269> how<00:02:40.269> does<00:02:40.329> the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
higher grade than this one how does the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.530 
higher grade than this one how does the
coin<00:02:40.780> become<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> deep<00:02:41.860> mirror<00:02:42.280> proof<00:02:42.700> light<00:02:42.970> so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
coin become a deep mirror proof light so

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.120 
coin become a deep mirror proof light so
when<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> dyes<00:02:44.049> are<00:02:44.350> originally

when the dyes are originally

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.640 
when the dyes are originally
manufactured<00:02:46.030> they're<00:02:46.750> highly<00:02:47.110> polished

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
manufactured they're highly polished

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.370 
manufactured they're highly polished
they'll<00:02:48.100> also<00:02:48.480> repolish<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> dyes<00:02:49.810> after<00:02:50.350> a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
they'll also repolish the dyes after a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.620 
they'll also repolish the dyes after a
period<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.799> time<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.670> eliminate<00:02:52.299> some<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
period of time to eliminate some of the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.390 
period of time to eliminate some of the

wear and each time that happens it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.610 
wear and each time that happens it
creates<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:55.209> would<00:02:55.810> look<00:02:55.989> like<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> mirrored

they came out with deep mirror poop like

however<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.860> result<00:03:03.190> how<00:03:04.000> popular

it's<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.170> things<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.620> we<00:03:08.799> do<00:03:09.010> is

it's one of the things that we do is

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.979 
it's one of the things that we do is
every<00:03:09.940> time<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.120> come<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> show<00:03:10.720> we're

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
every time we come to a show we're

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.630 
every time we come to a show we're
