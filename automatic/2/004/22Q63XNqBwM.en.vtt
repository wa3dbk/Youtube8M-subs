that<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.280> actually<00:02:34.750> cut<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.930> off<00:02:36.080> I'll

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
that if you actually cut it off I'll

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.670 
that if you actually cut it off I'll
just<00:02:36.650> grab<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> little<00:02:37.130> bit<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:38.590> where<00:02:39.590> you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
just grab a little bit of where you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.440 
just grab a little bit of where you
actually<00:02:39.799> cut<00:02:40.069> off<00:02:40.099> you<00:02:40.280> see<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.549> white<00:02:41.150> milk

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
actually cut off you see this white milk

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.750 
actually cut off you see this white milk
here<00:02:41.690> if<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.530> were<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.650> put<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.950> onto<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.340> spot

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
here if you were to put it onto a spot

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.530 
here if you were to put it onto a spot
that<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.030> has<00:02:44.510> no<00:02:44.870> skin<00:02:45.739> cancer<00:02:46.420> nothing<00:02:47.420> will

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
that is has no skin cancer nothing will

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.979 
that is has no skin cancer nothing will
happen

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
happen

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.039 
happen
so<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.640> won't<00:02:49.820> actually<00:02:49.970> do<00:02:50.299> anything<00:02:50.510> on<00:02:50.930> my

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.569 
so this won't actually do anything on my
hand<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.859> don't<00:02:52.250> think<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.430> have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
hand because I don't think I have

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.819 
hand because I don't think I have
anything<00:02:52.760> on<00:02:52.940> my<00:02:53.000> hand<00:02:53.269> but<00:02:53.510> yeah<00:02:54.380> when<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> put

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
anything on my hand but yeah when I put

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.440

it<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> place<00:02:55.400> where<00:02:55.640> there<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.150> little

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
it on to a place where there is a little

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.650 
it on to a place where there is a little
dry<00:02:56.690> patch<00:02:56.930> or<00:02:57.109> or<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:58.060> melanoma<00:02:59.060> as<00:02:59.420> such

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
dry patch or or a melanoma as such

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.250 
dry patch or or a melanoma as such
there's<00:03:00.400> activity<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:03.109> very

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
there's activity going on so it's very

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.430 
there's activity going on so it's very
interesting<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:05.510> we'll<00:03:05.630> see<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:05.930> happens
