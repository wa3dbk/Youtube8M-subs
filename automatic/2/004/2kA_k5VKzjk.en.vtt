00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.229 
I am done modifying my 4x4 I do have to
say<00:03:21.629> it<00:03:21.840> does<00:03:22.080> help<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.890> bit<00:03:23.610> that's<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
say it does help a bit that's the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.750 
say it does help a bit that's the
lock-up<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:28.129> on<00:03:29.129> a<00:03:29.190> scale<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.579> one<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
lock-up but it's on a scale of one to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
lock-up but it's on a scale of one to
ten<00:03:30.060> how<00:03:31.019> much<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.799> was<00:03:32.310> improved<00:03:32.760> I'm<00:03:33.599> going

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
ten how much it was improved I'm going

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.520 
ten how much it was improved I'm going
to<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.110> go<00:03:34.230> with<00:03:34.560> six<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.190> seven<00:03:35.610> it's

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
to have to go with six or seven it's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.979 
to have to go with six or seven it's
it's<00:03:37.530> noticeable<00:03:38.660> but<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> still<00:03:39.989> locks<00:03:40.200> up

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
it's noticeable but it still locks up

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.589 
it's noticeable but it still locks up
definitely<00:03:42.989> makes<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.410> easier<00:03:43.769> but<00:03:44.430> again

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.420 

well<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:49.170> I'm<00:03:49.530> going<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.739> go<00:03:49.859> clean<00:03:50.250> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430
