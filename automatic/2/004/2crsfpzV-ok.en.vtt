00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 good guys, well, a boat of objects that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 I am hardy is're in a new 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.439
 modality that I have never climbed but that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 the truth I think it is very funny 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.599
 the game already built a video before 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 uploaded to the channel and I hope it's 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.149
 pretty cool I hope you like the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.759
 modality because it is very very funny 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.010
 and if you can support it with your 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.780
 like and your 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.370
 I like to share it on twitter or by 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 which is your social networks and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 You can also leave a comment 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.860
 saying what is downcast or well 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.150
 they left you want a comment I'm worth 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.130
 assigned guys 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.810
 'See you, let's play some games 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:56.250
 and nothing I hope you like 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.250
 you have this this is my big one 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.510
 is that there is a group of 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.180
 runners that you see are these a 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.410
 group of trolls that are the ones who will see 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.880
 during the whole race there is a 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.280
 troll group which good then they go 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.060
 tolerating not here for example we have 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.620
 straits that are jumps I do not know how it is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.840
 our deduce exactly are about 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.130
 jumps which then we can use myself 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 I know if they try to troll us 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.700
 we can hit a jump and not fall 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.590
 you know tail so for example there are lewis what 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.390
 I may have used things that I'm not 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.490
 used to but good, I already say that they are 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.840
 useful and you'll see that I'm going to 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.910
 use at some point and you will see that they are 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.070
 quite useful the subject will be in 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.990
 It does not hurt much 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.000
 got not burn me here surely 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.680
 the lines so c's 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.680
 it does not work 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 here 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 so then for 33 up here I hope 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.450
 that does not fail in a video 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.569

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.130
 ok here I entered leo already so we can 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.510
 pass perfectly any type 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.480
 It is a pity is that I am a park 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.480
 I really hate it, I'm a park, it's better 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.050

 this I suppose is from the western 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.070

 a lot also seems very very epic not 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.919
 I find it very entertaining to record 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.360
 both to record and to see so nothing is 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.710
 everything also with friends is usually even 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.810
 more fun so if you want I can 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.380
 record with someone and nothing can be all 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.669
 everyone and see you in the next one 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.080
 it works here I'm starting that if it's going to 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.080
 have an epic day because it does not work 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:47.440
