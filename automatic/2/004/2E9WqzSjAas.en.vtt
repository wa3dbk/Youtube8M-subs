00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.600
 hello that such friends speak to them Jorge 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.300
 June camargo are tutorials 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.100
 thank you very much for visiting this video and 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.430
 this new course 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.110
 next let's start looking 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.480
 some basics concepts of 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 mathematics applying the tangram egg 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.370
 this egg with seven pieces 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.820
 It is widely used in the first years of 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.760
 baccalaureate and in some offices 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.360
 psychological problems you have not usually 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.500
 exploited its full potential in these 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 fields in which I just had them 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 to mention 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 a good pedagogue is capable of teaching 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.690
 his students apart from more than 16,000 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 forms that can be created with this with 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.910
 this so big 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.970
 and other concepts as it is 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:43.390
 fractionaries in masses perimeters areas 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.970
 another how is the Pythagorean theorem and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.550
 many more applications that can be 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.570
 use and you can learn through 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.880
 of this game in a very didactic way 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.360
 so let's look at what is in thong 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.730
 the tangram or seven boards of cunning 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.580
 referring to the qualities that 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.190
 the game requires is a very Chinese game 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.440
 ancient that consists of forming silhouettes 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 of figures with the seven pieces given 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 without overlapping the seven pieces 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.730
 dance calls are the following five 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.040
 triangles rectangles two built 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.500
 with the main diagonal of it 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.130
 size the two small of the fringe 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.150
 central are also the same size 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.260
 a square 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.659
 a parallelogram or rhomboid 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.460
 normally the suns are saved forming 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.680
 a square 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
 there are several versions about the origin 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.540
 from the word tangram 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.150
 one of the most accepted account that the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.660
 the word was invented by an Englishman joining the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.960
 Cantonese word tang meaning 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.930
 Chinese with the Latin word grama that 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.560
 means written or graphic another version 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.320
 says the origin of the fire went back 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.810
 to the years 618 907 of our era era 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.310
 in which the dynasty reigned in China 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:19.000
 tang from where its good name derives 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:23.460
 The first thing we are going to do is explain 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.100
 what is the good thong like you already 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.430
 I already explained to you at the beginning is a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.600
 figure is a is a game that consists of 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.400
 seven tiles with geometric shapes but 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.650
 as such 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.450
 this has its logic and how it has 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.140
 done well this was taken out of a box the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.660
 picture we see here this is the square 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.440
 then the first thing that is taught to 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.530
 the students in the first grades 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.080
 of baccalaureate is how to create the tangram 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.750
 or at least as it is done then 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.990
 let's explain it good first 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.650
 it is divided by a diagonal 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.890
 on a diagonal the square square 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.050
 as we see here half one of the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.280
 halves we divide it in two and here we 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.050
 are these two triangles that are the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.790
 two larger triangles that has 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.930
 our so big 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.620
 ready 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.880
 with the other half that's it 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.220
 then on the diagonal 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.330
 we are going to divide this same diagonal 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.069
 in four parts 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.969
 which is where the other ones are going to come from 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.989
 figures 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:45.080
 in the same way in the remaining sides 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:47.820
 each outwardly 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.570
 the shorter sides 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:56.220
 we are going to divide them in half to 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.590
 so is that way out 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.170
 and all the figures and the only thing is 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.570
 cut in such a way that here comes out 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.840
 a triangle we have a square in the 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:13.470
 half another triangle of the same size 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:17.009
 that the one here is a rhomboid 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.569
 or a parallelogram also called so 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:23.289
 and a medium triangle 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.289
 this 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.770
 well this in order to have certain 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.160
 proportionality is that we are going to be 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.490
 useful to learn how to manage the 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.350
 tangram and learn some concepts that 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.529
 we will be seeing in the course of 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.189
 this from this series of videos 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:50.080
 so good that's what it was 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:52.030
 explained today with the tangram 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.789
 thank you very much for watching this video 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.280
 remember to subscribe like this 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.599
 video if you liked it and visit the next 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.669
 video 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:04.300
 in the next video we will see what 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:07.930
 is the Pythagorean theorem applying the 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.000
 Thank you tangram and see you soon 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.280
 thank you very much for subscribing no 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.530
 forget that you can be more in touch 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.600
 through the social networks 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.270
 you can find in the description of 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.100
 this video we see in another video 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.100
 thanks for your company
