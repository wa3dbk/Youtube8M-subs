00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 welcome to this new video of scorer drummers so today we 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.270
 will tackle the Christmas theme 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.350
 peace not the bass drum 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.180
 so first of all have to know that foot on the big pedal that's this 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.229
 is not anywhere 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.089
 so if you put it too much 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.239
 behind the pedal 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.070
 for example, 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 you are very very very little control over them the movement 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.200
 it is necessary to press very very strongly with the point of power to the end 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.960
 so 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.990
 it's countered 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 a position advocated in the same way that if you put your foot on our 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.860
 costs too much of the pedal 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.130
 you do not have much dynamic 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.640
 so that's for the placement so also makes the foot is placed 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.840
 we will say with the om 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 the water of the production foot but the pedal 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.940
 then with regard to the striking in both schools 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 she operates on schedule her talent set to this one in fact all the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.280
 job 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.590
 the movement is fed up 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.670
 let go 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.490
 these delays 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.900
 it is the vocation of falling revenues 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 the pivot axel piers turns short 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.560
 which 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.760
 then 6% 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 it is an ancestor technique that has too much control 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.930
 we can play 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.859
 finally 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.620
 Why 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.789
 and also sign 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.900
 it's a position that left 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.320
 room is quiet in the sense that these business skeptics 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 at low speed makes it man 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.750
 its an asset 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.750
 to play eric patients 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.190
 as for the passage we go a little more the only disadvantage of one of the opposition 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.690
 were totally flat 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.370
 it is that it lacks fishing 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 to really send back heavy to have a big sound 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 you have to see this is the deadline 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.249
 is it harder then 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.010
 if you play a music a little disappointed 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.880
 in the trend actually razmak we are really sent with the race 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.429
 checkout 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.079
 we can see a little more power than we will do what is it 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.079
 we were growing slightly 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 the terran so it stops there position stiletto heels 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.190
 and instead of having a crazy move 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.589
 in fact in one movement 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.369
 before a bad holiday party 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.369
 the son-in-law so it's the Czech Republic it's the knee that does nothing 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.739
 send the word 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.949
 foot on the moon on the head 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.079
 so inevitably 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.739
 we have a lot more fishing like that and we lose a little bit in control 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.159
 in particular speed finally we control 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.249
 without control of the site 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.769
 it's harder to do 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.079
 a big blow following a knife 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.659
 so which the two the net positions is the best lack of tracking 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.529
 not really hard 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:58.939
 not really aim 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.379
 universal answer 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.739
 it's as you prefer and to know how most of the time we 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.939
 can change along the way if we start with a tempo this is where we go 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.029
 restart 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:11.909
 heels 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.479
 and the more we increase 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 more and more 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.779
 so that's it for the base of greece with their son or their daughter 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:22.799
 acceleration 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.059
 even 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.369
 hen b 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.369
 after a moment 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 we can not do it anymore, but that's it for after 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.299
 so it's rare not to commit township done when we do 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.019
 note that chantal obindé sechaud 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.609
 never took off 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.059
 the dock 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.809
 I had teammates so offered is that we are never sure about the 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.249
 beach 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.499
 this forgiveness must always keep the foot sole 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.469
 in contact with the pedal 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.329
 then 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.430
 e 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.430
 in parallel a person ask the question so I play 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:07.499
 he took off 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:08.779
 aubade paste 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.149
 % and more 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.829
 no universal answer 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.150
 so a little played either eur heels flat 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.930
 do not take off his flat heel 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.930
 dakolé must know that to ensure tours that has very very little 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.610
 difference 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.270
 aware that it is a big suspense 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.729
 still the date 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.850
 we crush the skin 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.850
 so she can not reason so the sound will be much busier 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.470
 the tights bring him down to the point of making a common pact on the snare drum 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.169
 with the chopsticks 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.279
 the complaint might not have to wait for that a summary 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.270
 and so we will have a much more open sound a year 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.470
 for those who have the chance to play on a strict shot if the first shots this 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.349
 that on acoustics shows the trial of the six blues 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.389
 6 just a substantive difference 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.930
 those who play on electronic addition also advised to play two because 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.300
 that the day you pack sure 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.810
 that these five other tourists those who have the chance to play on the effect of 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.110
 fashion 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.110
 train 2 for me 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:14.620
 we'll say 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.639
 by choice 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.960
 I prefer to play has sprung 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.990
 precisely because as a player on the net rebound of some 6 4 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.919
 the sound was a lot more wild take off 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.029
 marcel tout court ce fois 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.259
 and a magister canes that you have a good help and I find now 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.419
 you have to practice at the end it's up to you to play now
