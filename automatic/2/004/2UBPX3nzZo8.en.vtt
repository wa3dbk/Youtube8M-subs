actually<00:02:52.770> need<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.790> right<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.330> top<00:02:54.570> of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
actually need like right on the top of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.230 
actually need like right on the top of
my<00:02:54.780> test

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.420 

like<00:02:57.900> right<00:02:58.170> below<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.620> top<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.920> my<00:02:58.980> jacket<00:02:59.870> so

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.490 

it<00:03:03.819> looks<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.329> would<00:03:04.450> say<00:03:04.629> this<00:03:04.840> one<00:03:05.079> screen<00:03:05.319> is

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
it looks I would say this one screen is

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.540 
it looks I would say this one screen is
pretty

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
pretty

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.470 
pretty
its<00:03:06.880> success<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.840> looks<00:03:08.230> awesome<00:03:08.470> like<00:03:08.860> this

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.720 

I<00:03:12.739> think<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.800> sort<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.040> chose<00:03:14.220> another<00:03:14.430> day<00:03:14.670> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
I think it sort of chose another day to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.880 
I think it sort of chose another day to
test<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.239> out<00:03:15.420> actually<00:03:15.900> because<00:03:16.110> today

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
test this out actually because today

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.100 
test this out actually because today

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
twisting I would normally will I use the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.900 
twisting I would normally will I use the
screen<00:03:38.090> more<00:03:38.510> than<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.900> regular<00:03:39.110> one<00:03:39.470> ah<00:03:39.910> I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
screen more than a regular one ah I

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.600 

as<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.380> said<00:03:45.440> before<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.010> wind<00:03:46.190> hits<00:03:46.310> me<00:03:46.580> like

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
as I said before the wind hits me like

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.790 
as I said before the wind hits me like
right<00:03:47.000> right<00:03:47.360> on<00:03:48.020> top<00:03:48.230> my<00:03:48.440> chest<00:03:49.120> so

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.770 

I<00:03:52.890> mean<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.520> not<00:03:53.670> making<00:03:53.880> my<00:03:54.060> head<00:03:54.300> bump<00:03:54.630> it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
pressure on my body of choice because

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.450 
pressure on my body of choice because
the<00:03:58.860> screen<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.160> smaller

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
the road you know going to constant

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.610 
the road you know going to constant
speed<00:04:10.950> or<00:04:11.100> whatever<00:04:11.540> I've<00:04:12.540> noticed<00:04:13.290> something

now<00:04:13.860> with<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.160> one<00:04:14.430> screen<00:04:15.200> my<00:04:16.200> shoulders

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
now with this one screen my shoulders

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.520 
now with this one screen my shoulders
are<00:04:16.650> actually<00:04:17.010> getting<00:04:17.130> more<00:04:17.340> tired<00:04:18.049> or<00:04:19.049> my

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
are actually getting more tired or my

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.360

arm<00:04:19.560> actually<00:04:20.160> my<00:04:20.220> throttle<00:04:20.640> arm<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:25.370> don't

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
arm actually my throttle arm and I don't

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.740 
arm actually my throttle arm and I don't
know<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.670> because<00:04:26.760> i<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:27.210> been<00:04:27.480> riding

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
know if it's because i have been riding

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.690 
know if it's because i have been riding
or<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.890> it<00:04:29.040> because

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.910 

of<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.880> wind<00:04:33.060> screen<00:04:33.590> because<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.710> where<00:04:34.830> the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
of this wind screen because of where the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.440 
of this wind screen because of where the
wind<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.130> sitting<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.550> think<00:04:35.580> what<00:04:35.970> this<00:04:36.240> way

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
wind is sitting I think what this way

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.860 
wind is sitting I think what this way
screen<00:04:36.720> does<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:38.610> takes<00:04:38.940> away<00:04:39.210> some<00:04:39.270> oh

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
screen does is it it takes away some oh

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.650 
screen does is it it takes away some oh
no<00:04:40.560> da<00:04:40.770> takes<00:04:41.100> my<00:04:41.250> wind<00:04:41.490> protection<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:42.090> mean<00:04:42.390> I

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
no da takes my wind protection I mean I

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.330 
no da takes my wind protection I mean I
think<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.350> takes<00:04:43.530> away<00:04:43.680> web<00:04:44.190> protection

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
think it takes away web protection

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.690 
think it takes away web protection
against<00:04:44.880> my<00:04:45.060> shoulders<00:04:45.860> well<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> mean<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.220> said

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
arm so it's causing me to you know

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.730 
arm so it's causing me to you know
become<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:55.080> little<00:04:55.350> bit<00:04:55.440> more<00:04:55.620> tiring

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
become a little bit more tiring

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.660 
become a little bit more tiring
well<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.310> got<00:04:57.520> used<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.819> it<00:04:57.849> I<00:04:58.000> don't<00:04:58.150> know

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.590 

that's<00:05:01.670> one<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> things<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.420> will

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
that's one of the things that will

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.190 
that's one of the things that will
decide<00:05:02.930> if<00:05:03.500> i<00:05:03.710> use<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.130> screening<00:05:04.550> or<00:05:04.760> not

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
decide if i use this screening or not

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.710 
decide if i use this screening or not
see<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.320> thing<00:05:06.350> is<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.910> main<00:05:08.090> reason<00:05:08.480> I<00:05:08.540> got

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
see the thing is the main reason I got

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.810

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
i don't have the spot one screen because

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.510 
i don't have the spot one screen because
the<00:05:58.789> bike<00:05:58.940> didn't<00:05:59.210> come<00:05:59.330> apart
