00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
which i decided that i didn't want to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.950 
really still loved designing I loved
creating<00:00:40.560> and<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.370> loved<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.570> idea<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
creating and I loved the idea of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.410 
creating and I loved the idea of
self-expression<00:00:43.890> through<00:00:44.370> through<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.300> we

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
self-expression through through what we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.229 
self-expression through through what we
wear<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.440> describe<00:00:46.800> my<00:00:47.340> designs<00:00:47.850> as

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
wear I would describe my designs as

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.459 
wear I would describe my designs as
mixing<00:00:49.850> something<00:00:50.850> tremendous<00:00:51.570> something

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
mixing something tremendous something

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.520 
mixing something tremendous something
extraordinary<00:00:52.859> with<00:00:53.429> something<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:53.879> simple

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
extraordinary with something very simple

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.910 
extraordinary with something very simple
so<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.890> idea<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.429> me<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.920> accessory

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so the idea to me is that an accessory

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.669 
so the idea to me is that an accessory
should<00:00:59.280> stand<00:00:59.760> out<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.350> should<00:01:01.530> be

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
should stand out so it should be

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.290 
should stand out so it should be
something<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.280> gets<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> compliments<00:01:03.149> when

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
something that gets you compliments when

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
something that gets you compliments when
you<00:01:03.390> leave<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.719> house<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.860> should<00:01:05.040> also

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you leave your house but it should also

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
you leave your house but it should also
be<00:01:05.370> easy<00:01:05.670> enough<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:07.230> could<00:01:07.650> stay<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
be easy enough that it could stay and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.810 
be easy enough that it could stay and
steady<00:01:08.520> rotation<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.330> nightstand<00:01:10.820> my
