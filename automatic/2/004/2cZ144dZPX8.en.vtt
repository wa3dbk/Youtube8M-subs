00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
up just putting something together then

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.699 
up just putting something together then
it<00:03:35.500> came<00:03:35.739> from<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.670> not<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.660> at<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.470> same

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709

time<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.040> bet<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.549> if<00:03:39.640> we<00:03:39.670> talked<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:41.760> Beethoven

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
time I bet you if we talked to Beethoven

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.340 
time I bet you if we talked to Beethoven
or<00:03:42.880> Chopin<00:03:43.769> they<00:03:44.769> would<00:03:45.180> speak<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.480> some<00:03:47.079> way

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
or Chopin they would speak in some way

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.160 
or Chopin they would speak in some way
that<00:03:47.739> they<00:03:48.400> would<00:03:48.579> say<00:03:48.820> yes<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.540> had<00:03:49.720> everything

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
that they would say yes I had everything

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.650 
that they would say yes I had everything
to<00:03:50.440> do<00:03:50.650> with<00:03:50.980> making<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.730> music<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.450> had

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
to do with making the music and I had

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.430 
to do with making the music and I had
nothing<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.350> do<00:03:53.560> with<00:03:54.160> making<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.700> music<00:03:55.440> it's

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
nothing to do with making the music it's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.280 
nothing to do with making the music it's
like<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.739> music<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.549> what<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:59.019> sense

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
like the music is what it is in a sense

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.710 
like the music is what it is in a sense
you<00:03:59.620> see<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.670> created<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.600> way<00:04:03.720> it's

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
you see and I created it that way it's

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.590 
you see and I created it that way it's
this<00:04:05.880> relationship<00:04:06.880> anyway<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.239> thought<00:04:07.540> I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
this relationship anyway I thought I

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.120 
this relationship anyway I thought I
would<00:04:08.459> toss<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:09.670> out<00:04:09.880> there
