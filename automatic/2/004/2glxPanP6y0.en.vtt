00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.599
 I thought I'd feel you some. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.539
 some pain but it's all you can do 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.689
 quiet in straight sets is important to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.000
 I'm very pleased with you 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.609
 this pre - season and hope to later 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.029
 to prepare well for me this three years 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 year 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.820
 when a club like paulo is there? 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:43.460
 For one year, that's how it's been a year. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 bad when you do not win it's a bad year and 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 will the liberators at least there makes 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.820
 worse still the pressure it always goes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.860
 and who is here today has to have 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.640
 this awareness is prepared to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.480
 this pressure of victory is always a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 big team always has collection has medium 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 what an obligation to win and will not be 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 different this year 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.299
 logical that this year what the pressure that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.900
 exists is a greater commitment than 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.729
 Last year it was unfortunate 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.990
 now I have no obsession with just wanting 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.680
 back to selection 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.590
 I think things are happening. 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.439
 of course as soon as you return to play 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.290
 on a level that everyone knows 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.049
 consequently throwing all that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.560
 I'm used to it, I think it's going to paint. 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 opportunity in the selection was the people 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.979
 was marked by TV to the defeat of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.890
 Netherlands but overall I think this 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.870
 selection did not deserve to pass everything 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.810
 people passed 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.990
 logical that after a defeat all 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.490
 world will criticize everyone will speak 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.290
 but I think we deserved a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:12.130
 greater respect than we have had 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:15.560
 because it is after the canopy looks like that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:21.530
 that group was no longer worth anything 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 I had a player who has what can and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.740
 that is able to wear the shirt of the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.100
 New selection was all very similar 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.020
 only renewal and renewal was mentioned 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.500
 I think it's not quite right there, I guess. 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.410
 You have to have a little bit of calm 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.110
 defeat gives to everyone but I think 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.250
 that we still have a certain value 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.970
 so I think past is past today 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.200
 there is a renewal that is normal in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.640
 selection but I think at the moment that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.830
 that I am reminded not to select 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.400
 will even weigh my performance within the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.400
 world Cup
