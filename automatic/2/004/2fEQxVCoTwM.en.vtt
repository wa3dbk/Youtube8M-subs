00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hi my love made believe today an info video of me and 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.190
 Although the team bitter 1 point 8 who the team would have concord 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.200
 Dollar bill probably 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.539
 around at Mohring Park maybe even today is not quite sure yet 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.769
 then he did not announce percent 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.220
 and if so from what will be in a spot eight times 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 that was a point 8 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.369
 is it scary adventure covering this Edwin Scharff becomes a new active 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.560
 Game mode namely the credit mode 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 he added by stopping then 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.180
 Bayern in a new card 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.510
 m as rumkriegen Kammeltal and in Fredelsloh 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.300
 Werder and lie were limited - roses once a packed Singapore 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.290
 Water does not hold itself Gallus 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.199
 and percent again has his credit EKD freewheel waterproof Jemal 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.600
 who want to build major projects or something similar, it's just a perfect one 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.899
 in mode and seedy off blue but it's not just in that thanks for the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.149
 Printed mode has become so, too, and Sinclair has changed a lot 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.910
 For example 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.190
 There is a whole new parameter in the 81 called Sam platform Rivers 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.380
 everything is being redone everything is just realistic so i believe 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.560
 and that's where Bernhard Lockhorn came from, so it was as fast as around here 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.400
 those mods that you just have NPCs and build the Berndorfer and second 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.680
 one knows maybe one of these power struggles and simple so it is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 really cool and that will also cause new parties here to give offense 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.660
 have been punchy and 2 there will of course encounter opponents 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.160
 and there it should again on whether the relation began during this 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.430
 around which knows the name Ina Menzer 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.670
 they are 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.580
 three feet tall so 3 will probably be able to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.050
 So let them imagine that this country looks like this on this picture 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.520
 Panama the URL of Dr 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.720
 because his from the his and out there should be this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.210
 to a criticism Langmann not on the coquette Frankfurt 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.180
 then the actual freezing and Oberlandler would meet Cook 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 the one immediately 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.119
 and you see he can fight this Andermatt with water 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.429
 Of course, let's do something like this 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.739
 the arc 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.759
 whatever will be 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.950
 the transmitter Menz can buy Blur purchase 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.689
 and also things have not been so cool either 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.499
 and then 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.019
 You can then stop 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.019
 Do things like for example 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.129
 because with all risky is introduced that, for example, it 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.229
 Three critical partners balance one another's neck and sprinter 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.089
 stop and hit the opponent with it 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.399
 was about 100 euros still the bow was his 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.089
 So um 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:44.389
 Percent I calculate job he finds himself there was a lot done and right 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.329
 that too, leaving a new point system 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.339
 Stone was added 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.889
 that was already at 1 point i think 6 from red this murderous thing 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.999
 I think he was, I hope it will 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.299
 look really nice again 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.310
 and then they are all looking forward to it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.699
 the team continues 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.140
 1 point 8 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.800
 that of course for me again a pagan work called Mods athletes 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.660
 Clariant everything you know and here have let us just go 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.430
 surprise what's new is what comes here maybe what else 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.489
 Spokesman not so Brazil has so yes 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.059
 Then they make a fool and then I asked myself one of these places 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.319
 Shots until next time
