00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello I'm the sander of the horse 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.529
 inside.com and I want you guys today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.530
 As for the subject, how can I take my horse 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.530
 to support moderately support 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.460
 Circulatory problems in the horse are even 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.990
 not as rare as you think, of course 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.970
 It is more of a problem of horses 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.880
 oldest i have my old mare here 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.239
 So I've heard that to me since then 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.280
 27 years now she is 34 years old and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:47.059
 they are still so happy in principle 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.340
 Stubborn as ever before 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.680
 okay, but if we now 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.850
 somehow have strong weather changes and 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.799
 we have that again in the mountains 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.650
 relatively often or when we go to 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.900
 for example, this strong this strong 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.699
 suite wind then have the lead then 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.409
 I sometimes realize that they are so 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.600
 a little matter is what else is 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.490
 actually very funny horse and yes it 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.110
 is also very emotional and then 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.690
 I realize that I want you now 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.720
 a few simple techniques show how he looks 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.630
 such days or or simply as 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.970
 energetic prophylaxis to yours perhaps 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.729
 a little older or maybe something 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.830
 help weaker horse and it 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.910
 can support a very simple 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.310
 engineering times I have of a 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.960
 vet dr reinhard thannhauser learned 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.790
 if a horse is really off the circle 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.800
 on not so good then you can here 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 that is this point yes in humans 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 a circulation point simply by small 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.990
 tapping here will activate the nose 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.380
 This immediately makes the horse more alert 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.850
 was active 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.440
 So you can sometimes for example 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.300
 use if the horse is very tired or 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.950
 very tired before a workout is that 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.630
 Just do it a little bit again 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.730
 on hectares and how to get here easily 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.909
 easy loosely that would be one 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.590
 technology the second technique is when you 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.330
 Now for example most people 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.520
 may know that from the eased 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.229
 you can just do one left ear 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.959
 make a pointy massage 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.000
 depending on how very calm or 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.159
 maybe even a bit sluggish of that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.150
 horses a bit faster and also 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.459
 a little bit more pressure 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.750
 depending on what I like that too 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.120
 just like to point this way dior 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.519
 massage and then there would be one more 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.680
 simple technology change then it would be 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.780
 a simple technique of how to be horse 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.660
 also a bit at short notice 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.450
 is more active and can make attentive 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.300
 simply by knocking on the horse 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.250
 So exercise a form of massage 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.190
 I make my hands too small 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.709
 bowl so in style and tap 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.040
 just here along the muscles and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.390
 depending on the stop like more or less 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.520
 really activate 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.800
 I should be able to knock these 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.390
 knock faster or can 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.400
 I also have a stronger or with 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.280
 weaker pressure knock show you 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.860
 So again that jesus that we now 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.120
 with less pressure 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.550
 You can hear that we are already with 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.980
 much more pressure, however, immediately 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.440
 a little dust out so that would be now 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.450
 simple techniques how to do the circuit 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.430
 the horse can assist to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.959
 example as we with the older horse 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.030
 Of course it does not replace it 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.709
 any chrysler 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.180
 a veterinarian so 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.560
 if he really has problems with circulation 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.569
 Of course you always have one 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.880
 Vet to advise that is belief 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.470
 I always clear but that we now what where 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.600
 I say I can just go there and 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.560
 again when I notice the weather 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.660
 Maybe it's from my horse 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.790
 exhausting or might be exhausting 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.739
 where you just prophylactic 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.269
 really the circuit maybe for 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.430
 example as with her in an older 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.060
 Just kind of support the horse 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.280
 can 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.190
 Of course there are also subtle ones 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.230
 seen classical means so many 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.600
 homeopathic veterinarians recommend to 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.030
 example white gates as a classic 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.650
 Circulation means for circulation strengthening 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.450
 Maybe you can do that every now and then 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.790
 just sometimes as drops administered 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.400
 or you can also go every now and then 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.500
 Let's make it where you are 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.420
 really these investors, as it were 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.609
 Tea administered to horses like that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.030
 very simply prophylactic too 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.620
 back to support and a good one 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.239
 complementary circulation means are even 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.970
 so the rescue drops so the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.460
 You can get bachblÃ¼ten emergency drops 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.220
 also in every pharmacy and is too 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.470
 of course for the whole energetic 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.250
 circle of support of the horse 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.990
 useful and recommendable what 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.970
 Of course it is even better if you are now 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.740
 really ok i want my horse 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.419
 keep healthy and fit 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.790
 we really have one on the island 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.620
 really great easy 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.260
 seminar that means energetic 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.730
 horse care there you can really get one 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
 Just twice a week 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.540
 energy cycle of the horse 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.570
 harmonize and make it easy 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.400
 really facing problems or yes too 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.590
 apathetic states and so on 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.510
 So you can protect yourself really active 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.970
 health care with this seminar 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.680
 You can practice on your horse 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.980
 that really totally uncomplicated in ten 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.320
 15 minutes easy in the weekly 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.120
 drain with the cleaning 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.950
 maybe even sometimes 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.410
 instead of riding the horse 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.840
 because sometimes less is actually 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.180
 even more and just a horse is enough 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.530
 healthy fit supple and im 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.530
 to get energetic balance 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.360
 how it really makes sense for easy 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.190
 the health of your animal beneficial 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.900
 I wish you a lot of fun with this 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.900
 seminar your sandra
