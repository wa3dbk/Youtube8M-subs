at all that's the whole idea is just to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.370 
at all that's the whole idea is just to
kind<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.229> hide<00:01:47.409> everything<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.880> know<00:01:49.030> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
kind of hide everything so I know that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.200 
kind of hide everything so I know that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
back here and down into it so I'm gonna

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.139 
back here and down into it so I'm gonna
move<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> way<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.549> fact<00:02:09.910> I'll

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
move this out of the way in fact I'll

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.240 
move this out of the way in fact I'll
just<00:02:10.269> mark<00:02:10.509> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
just mark that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.949 
just mark that
that<00:02:12.250> general<00:02:12.670> area<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.600> want<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.840> put

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
that general area and so we want to put

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:21.540 
that general area and so we want to put
it<00:02:14.079> right<00:02:14.519> back<00:02:15.519> here<00:02:15.880> somewhere<00:02:16.329> okay

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.970 

move<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.700> TV<00:02:23.060> out<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.590> about<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
move that TV out so this is about the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.500 
move that TV out so this is about the
area<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.550> want<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> put<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.210> we<00:02:26.360> want

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
area where we want to put it but we want

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.970 
area where we want to put it but we want
to<00:02:26.600> check<00:02:26.750> for<00:02:26.810> studs<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.470> don't<00:02:27.620> want<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.890> be

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
to check for studs we don't want to be

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.530 
to check for studs we don't want to be
dealing<00:02:28.340> with<00:02:28.370> studs<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.090> case<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:29.510> just

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
dealing with studs in this case we just

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.050 
dealing with studs in this case we just
want<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.020> drywall<00:02:30.410> itself<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.460> we'll<00:02:31.700> use<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
want the drywall itself so we'll use the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.790 
want the drywall itself so we'll use the
stud<00:02:32.270> finder<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:34.040> take<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> look<00:02:36.880> okay

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
stud finder here to take a look okay

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.680 
stud finder here to take a look okay
should<00:02:39.800> find<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:40.250> right<00:02:40.400> over<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:41.450> does

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
should find one right over here it does

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.690 
should find one right over here it does
good<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:46.040> not<00:02:46.190> finding<00:02:46.640> one<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:48.700> it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
good it's not finding one and here it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.430 
good it's not finding one and here it
does<00:02:49.910> find<00:02:50.180> some<00:02:50.420> sort<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.660> power<00:02:50.840> here<00:02:51.200> though

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
does find some sort of power here though

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.380 
does find some sort of power here though
I'd<00:02:51.560> find<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.100> stud<00:02:52.730> finder<00:02:53.030> tends<00:02:53.240> to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
I'd find that this stud finder tends to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020 
I'd find that this stud finder tends to
think<00:02:53.540> everything's<00:02:54.020> lit<00:02:54.800> up<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.550> think

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
think everything's lit up so I think

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.050 
think everything's lit up so I think
we're<00:02:56.270> okay<00:02:56.830> but<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.340> section<00:02:58.640> over<00:02:59.030> here

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
we're okay but in this section over here

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.350 
we're okay but in this section over here
I<00:02:59.950> think<00:03:00.950> we're<00:03:01.070> gonna<00:03:01.160> be<00:03:01.370> alright<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.180> let's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
I think we're gonna be alright so let's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.970 
I think we're gonna be alright so let's
go<00:03:02.510> ahead<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.870> put<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.320> right<00:03:03.410> about<00:03:03.620> where<00:03:03.800> we

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
go ahead and put it right about where we

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.340 
go ahead and put it right about where we
wanted<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.700> we'll<00:03:05.150> take<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.390> look<00:03:05.630> now<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
wanted it and we'll take a look now a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.790 
wanted it and we'll take a look now a
couple<00:03:06.710> ways<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.860> do<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:08.440> again<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.620> can<00:03:09.770> use

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
couple ways to do this again you can use

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.730 
couple ways to do this again you can use
a<00:03:10.300> blade<00:03:11.300> like<00:03:11.540> utility<00:03:12.050> knife<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.260> go<00:03:12.530> ahead

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
a blade like utility knife to go ahead

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.710 
a blade like utility knife to go ahead
and<00:03:12.860> cut<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> square<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.490> here<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:14.270> can<00:03:14.480> use<00:03:14.510> a

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
and cut a square in here you can use a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.960 
and cut a square in here you can use a
drywall<00:03:15.230> saw<00:03:15.530> if<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:15.920> have<00:03:16.070> one<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.460> then

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
drywall saw if you have one and then

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.700 
drywall saw if you have one and then
there<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.480> also<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.870> little<00:03:18.080> template<00:03:18.470> that

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
there is also a little template that

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.320 
there is also a little template that
comes<00:03:19.220> with<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:22.460> plates<00:03:22.700> here<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.240> we

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
comes with the the plates here that we

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.090 
comes with the the plates here that we
can<00:03:23.480> use<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:23.870> we'll<00:03:23.990> go<00:03:24.110> ahead<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.380> use<00:03:24.920> this

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
can use so we'll go ahead and use this

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.070 
can use so we'll go ahead and use this
template<00:03:25.490> we'll<00:03:25.610> trace<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.030> out<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.330> that'll

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
template we'll trace it out and that'll

the flaps in and snug up against the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.130 
the flaps in and snug up against the
wall<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.770> hold<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.160> thing<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.400> place<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.930> our

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
wall and hold the thing in place so our

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:43.640 
wall and hold the thing in place so our
flaps<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:32.870> on<00:04:33.870> both<00:04:34.050> sides<00:04:41.450> okay<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.470> goes

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
flaps in on both sides okay and it goes

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.590 
flaps in on both sides okay and it goes
like<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.850> then<00:04:45.090> we<00:04:45.180> just<00:04:45.330> need<00:04:45.390> to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
like that and then we just need to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:54.140 
like that and then we just need to
tighten<00:04:45.900> this<00:04:45.990> thing<00:04:46.050> down<00:04:52.970> now<00:04:53.970> when<00:04:54.090> you

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
tighten this thing down now when you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.570 
tighten this thing down now when you
start<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.420> get<00:04:54.540> some<00:04:54.600> resistance<00:04:54.990> there<00:04:55.580> then

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
start to get some resistance there then

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580 
start to get some resistance there then
you<00:04:56.730> know<00:04:56.760> it's<00:04:57.080> just<00:04:58.080> check<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.410> make<00:04:58.560> sure

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
you know it's just check it make sure

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.100 
you know it's just check it make sure
it's<00:04:58.860> snug<00:04:58.980> okay<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.540> looks<00:05:00.720> good<00:05:00.900> there<00:05:01.080> and

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
it's snug okay it looks good there and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.870 
it's snug okay it looks good there and
again<00:05:01.440> we're<00:05:01.590> making<00:05:01.620> sure<00:05:01.950> that<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.280> opening

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
again we're making sure that the opening

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.850 
again we're making sure that the opening
is<00:05:03.000> going<00:05:03.090> downward<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:04.230> connect<00:05:04.530> with<00:05:04.710> our

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
is going downward to connect with our

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.140 
is going downward to connect with our
receiving<00:05:05.370> end<00:05:05.490> which<00:05:05.640> will<00:05:05.730> be<00:05:05.820> pointing

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
receiving end which will be pointing

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.980 
receiving end which will be pointing
upward<00:05:06.680> so<00:05:07.680> there's<00:05:07.860> one<00:05:08.070> part<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.930> okay<00:05:09.930> so

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
upward so there's one part of it okay so

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.600
