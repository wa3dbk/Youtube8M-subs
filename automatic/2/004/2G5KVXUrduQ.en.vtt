00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I did for my first ever time playing

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.900 
I did for my first ever time playing
advanced<00:02:25.260> warfare<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.800> PlayStation<00:02:26.430> 4

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
advanced warfare on the PlayStation 4

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.990 
advanced warfare on the PlayStation 4
I<00:02:26.940> got<00:02:27.360> 33<00:02:28.050> kills<00:02:28.380> nine<00:02:29.040> deaths<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.790> about

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
I got 33 kills nine deaths and about

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.380 
I got 33 kills nine deaths and about
five<00:02:30.300> assists<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:31.560> over<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.980> 3.0<00:02:32.730> KD<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
five assists so that's over a 3.0 KD and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.000 
five assists so that's over a 3.0 KD and
I<00:02:33.870> considering<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.530> my<00:02:34.710> very<00:02:34.920> first

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
I considering that this is my very first

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.760 
I considering that this is my very first
time<00:02:35.310> that's<00:02:35.730> not<00:02:35.970> bad<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.320> do<00:02:37.380> know

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
time that's not bad at all and I do know

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.190 
time that's not bad at all and I do know
that<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.460> game<00:02:38.670> kind<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.060> senses<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.690> am<00:02:40.020> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
that the game kind of senses that I am a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.620 
that the game kind of senses that I am a
first-time<00:02:40.560> player<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.420> don't<00:02:42.420> really

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
first-time player and I don't really

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.420 
first-time player and I don't really
have<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> high<00:02:43.050> KD<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.130> why<00:02:44.310> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
have a high KD so and that's why it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.310 
have a high KD so and that's why it
paired<00:02:44.730> me<00:02:44.850> with<00:02:44.880> players<00:02:45.270> who<00:02:45.360> maybe<00:02:46.050> weren't

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
paired me with players who maybe weren't

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.010 
paired me with players who maybe weren't
as<00:02:46.820> skilled<00:02:47.820> as<00:02:47.910> other<00:02:48.150> players<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:48.690> again

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
as skilled as other players but again

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.960

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
one to the PlayStation 4 wasn't as bad

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.610 
one to the PlayStation 4 wasn't as bad
as<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.090> thought<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.480> was<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.960> be<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
as I thought that it was going to be the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.290 
as I thought that it was going to be the
only<00:02:55.800> thing<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.130> was<00:02:56.310> super<00:02:56.700> difficult<00:02:56.880> for

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
only thing that was super difficult for

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.240 
only thing that was super difficult for
me<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.540> kind<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.810> get<00:02:57.960> used<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.320> was<00:02:58.830> as<00:02:58.980> soon<00:02:59.100> as

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
me to kind of get used to was as soon as

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.040 
me to kind of get used to was as soon as
I<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.550> kill<00:02:59.790> streak<00:03:00.120> my<00:03:00.450> ho<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.750> kind<00:03:00.960> of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
I got a kill streak my ho is kind of

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.410 
I got a kill streak my ho is kind of
reached<00:03:01.350> down<00:03:02.010> under<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> analog<00:03:03.030> stick<00:03:03.300> to

kind<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.700> get<00:03:18.330> used<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.140> most

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
kind of get used to but for the most

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.100 
kind of get used to but for the most
part<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:20.160> was<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> pretty<00:03:20.730> easy<00:03:20.940> transition<00:03:21.210> to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
part it was a pretty easy transition to

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.870 
part it was a pretty easy transition to
come<00:03:22.620> from<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.980> Xbox<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.790> the
