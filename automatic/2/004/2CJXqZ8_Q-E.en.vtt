 good today I bring you a new tutorial in 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.619
 which I will explain how to get 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:33.430
 train of cats good and we want 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.930
 get the cats so good the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.610
 true that is a little complicated in 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.430
 Most of you will know but I have decided 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.260
 do this tutorial because well I do not know 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.680
 it's a bit complicated so we 're going to 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.610
 wait a few let's catch here 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.610
 let's fish a fish 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.540
 which you are looking for a fish 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 to see if it's good while I tell you the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.600
 ocelots only appear language of the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.850
 together it's worth 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.140
 and can only be dragged with fish 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.600
 raw these here these others are not 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 the raw fish so first the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.080
 we have to make a cane 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.760
 and you have to go fishing to see if 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 I get one so you can see how good 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.520
 that we get legally 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.259
 well I already have mine now let's go to 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.500
 look for an ocelot so we get 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.040
 a sleeve and let's stay still 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.420
 looking looking looking looking worth 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.549
 you see that nothing happens 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.170
 you go a little behind, nothing good there, there 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.840
 you move a lot now when it comes to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.759
 you move us a lot once you stay 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.979
 still as you see here below does not move 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.830
 do not move slowly little by little 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.470
 little by little and you see that you are looking 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.149
 now is when you are going to click right 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.759
 and you see some clouds appear that's 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.310
 who does not want to be your kitten 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.780
 you click again and it has become 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.380
 in our data well now with this cat 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.880
 what you do is plan a river 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:41.750
 have a long day taster so 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:44.299
 it's not good because I really do not know which 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.350
 they are radio but more or less observe that 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:51.150

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.740
 Once you start to pay attention 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.640
 move slowly 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.930
 for example now he just stays 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.209
 still without lawful right 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.470
