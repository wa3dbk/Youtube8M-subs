I bought this fridge for about 50 euros
it's<00:00:57.360> working<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:59.030> mmm

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
it's working pretty well mmm

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's working pretty well mmm
come<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.309> em<00:01:03.229> to<00:01:04.229> make<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.589> better

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
come to em to make this better

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.899 
come to em to make this better
madam<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:08.750> removed<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> original<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
madam I removed the original and

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.380 
madam I removed the original and
temperature<00:01:11.909> controller<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:15.000> just

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
temperature controller and now it's just

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.170 
temperature controller and now it's just
cooling<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> am<00:01:16.170> connecting<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.970> power

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
cooling when I am connecting the power

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.219 
cooling when I am connecting the power

but SEC 1000 controls the temperature at
20<00:01:27.000> degrees<00:01:27.330> 21<00:01:28.049> degrees<00:01:28.460> Celsius<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
20 degrees 21 degrees Celsius and it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.060 
20 degrees 21 degrees Celsius and it
does<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:31.740> good<00:01:31.950> job<00:01:33.740> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
does a pretty good job this is the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.890 
does a pretty good job this is the
temperature<00:01:35.490> probe

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.160 

it's<00:01:39.900> under<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> layer<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> foam<00:01:41.720> some<00:01:42.720> tape

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's under a layer of foam some tape

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.910 
it's under a layer of foam some tape
over<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:45.000> give<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> cool<00:01:47.670> temperatures<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
over it to give the cool temperatures to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
over it to give the cool temperatures to
measure<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:51.780> way

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
measure it the right way

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.889 
measure it the right way
I<00:01:54.500> think<00:01:55.500> ICC<00:01:55.950> 1000<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.210> cheap<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I think ICC 1000 in this cheap and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
I think ICC 1000 in this cheap and
simple<00:01:58.380> refrigerator<00:01:59.250> does<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> pretty<00:01:59.880> good

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
simple refrigerator does a pretty good

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.499 
simple refrigerator does a pretty good
job<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.710> over<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.670> signs<00:02:03.360> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
job and over there you can see signs of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
job and over there you can see signs of
good<00:02:03.719> fermentation

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.820 

okay<00:02:09.190> now<00:02:09.430> what<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.640> forgot<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.270> mention<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
okay now what I forgot to mention is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.160 
okay now what I forgot to mention is
that<00:02:11.890> don't<00:02:12.310> use<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.960> heat<00:02:14.170> plug<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.780> heat

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
that don't use the heat plug on the heat

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.890 
that don't use the heat plug on the heat
part<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.040> sec<00:02:18.430> because<00:02:18.760> it's<00:02:19.660> summer

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
part of the sec because it's summer

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.290 
part of the sec because it's summer
right<00:02:20.380> now<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.820> surrounding

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
right now and the surrounding

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.780 
right now and the surrounding
temperature<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:23.020> about<00:02:23.320> 25<00:02:24.240> 26<00:02:25.240> degrees<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:26.790> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
temperature is about 25 26 degrees and I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.930 
temperature is about 25 26 degrees and I
only<00:02:28.000> need<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:29.080> cooling<00:02:30.510> plug<00:02:31.510> or<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> port

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
only need the cooling plug or the port

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.090 
only need the cooling plug or the port
it's<00:02:33.940> actually<00:02:34.570> telling<00:02:34.840> me<00:02:34.960> it's<00:02:35.680> heating

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
it's actually telling me it's heating

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.810 
it's actually telling me it's heating
right<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.670> now<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:38.200> doing<00:02:38.590> nothing<00:02:38.820> as

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
right and now but it's doing nothing as

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.760 
right and now but it's doing nothing as
you<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:40.180> see<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:42.190> steady<00:02:42.490> 20<00:02:43.090> degrees<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.780> set

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
you can see it's steady 20 degrees I set

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.970 
you can see it's steady 20 degrees I set
the<00:02:44.890> temperature<00:02:45.040> 21<00:02:46.000> degrees<00:02:46.330> Celsius<00:02:48.900> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the temperature 21 degrees Celsius and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.230 
the temperature 21 degrees Celsius and
eventually<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.280> will<00:02:52.770> getting<00:02:53.770> warmer<00:02:54.370> inside

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
eventually it will getting warmer inside

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.800 
eventually it will getting warmer inside
the<00:02:55.360> refrigerator<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.709> will<00:02:56.860> take<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the refrigerator but it will take a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.270 
the refrigerator but it will take a
couple<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.959> hours<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.560> then<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.220> will<00:03:02.280> switch

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
couple of hours and then it will switch

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.970 
couple of hours and then it will switch
on<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.880> refrigerator<00:03:04.540> again<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.800> will

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
on the refrigerator again and it will

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.940 
on the refrigerator again and it will
cool<00:03:06.220> down<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> twenty<00:03:07.900> degrees<00:03:08.230> again<00:03:13.950> I've

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
cool down to a twenty degrees again I've

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.190 
cool down to a twenty degrees again I've
set<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.370> temperature<00:03:15.700> differential<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.840> a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
set the temperature differential on a

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.479 
set the temperature differential on a
one<00:03:17.590> degree<00:03:17.800> Celsius<00:03:23.040> alright<00:03:24.040> thanks<00:03:24.430> for
