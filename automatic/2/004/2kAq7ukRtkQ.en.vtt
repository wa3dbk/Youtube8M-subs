world doesn't know what handle means

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.450 
world doesn't know what handle means
that<00:05:34.320> they're<00:05:34.530> out<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.800> loop<00:05:35.010> there

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
that they're out of the loop there

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.010 
that they're out of the loop there
another<00:05:35.670> loop<00:05:35.970> it's<00:05:36.210> hardly<00:05:36.480> they<00:05:36.630> start<00:05:36.990> a

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
another loop it's hardly they start a

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.600 
another loop it's hardly they start a
difficult<00:05:37.440> code<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.740> crack<00:05:37.920> is<00:05:38.130> it<00:05:38.250> yeah<00:05:38.370> gonna

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
difficult code to crack is it yeah gonna

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.100 
difficult code to crack is it yeah gonna
track<00:05:38.910> someone<00:05:39.210> it's<00:05:39.450> hardly<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.750> head<00:05:40.020> of

that's what codes what yeah that's what
codes<00:05:53.400> are<00:05:53.550> all<00:05:53.669> about<00:05:53.850> I<00:05:53.910> know<00:05:54.120> you<00:05:54.180> set<00:05:54.990> them

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
codes are all about I know you set them

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.360 
codes are all about I know you set them
up<00:05:55.169> in<00:05:55.320> that<00:05:55.410> going<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:55.830> town<00:05:55.980> with<00:05:56.100> tell<00:05:56.310> me

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
up in that going in town with tell me

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.400 
up in that going in town with tell me
the<00:05:56.490> code<00:05:56.640> then<00:05:56.940> reveal<00:05:57.360> it<00:05:57.540> long<00:05:57.720> last<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.260> the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
the code then reveal it long last to the

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.230 
the code then reveal it long last to the
world<00:05:58.620> what<00:05:58.950> codes<00:05:59.400> are<00:05:59.610> right<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.060> yeah

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
world what codes are right so yeah

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.420 
world what codes are right so yeah
what's<00:06:00.900> your<00:06:00.990> 20<00:06:01.410> well<00:06:01.680> were<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:01.890> this<00:06:02.280> is

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
what's your 20 well were you this is

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.830 
what's your 20 well were you this is
better<00:06:02.610> than<00:06:02.760> the<00:06:02.850> Enigma<00:06:03.300> yeah<00:06:03.510> I<00:06:03.540> don't<00:06:03.690> know

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
better than the Enigma yeah I don't know

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.050 
better than the Enigma yeah I don't know
here<00:06:03.990> we<00:06:04.110> go<00:06:04.290> what<00:06:04.710> how<00:06:05.370> many<00:06:05.430> candles<00:06:05.880> are<00:06:06.000> you

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
here we go what how many candles are you

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.710 
here we go what how many candles are you
burning<00:06:06.770> uh<00:06:07.820> does<00:06:08.820> that<00:06:08.850> mean<00:06:09.000> how<00:06:09.390> BIG's<00:06:09.630> your

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
burning uh does that mean how BIG's your

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.420 
burning uh does that mean how BIG's your
car<00:06:09.990> something<00:06:10.350> like<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.680> horsepower

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
car something like that horsepower

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.370 
car something like that horsepower
something<00:06:12.030> no<00:06:12.360> that's<00:06:12.600> that's<00:06:12.720> Oh<00:06:12.900> what<00:06:13.200> time

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
something no that's that's Oh what time

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.100 
something no that's that's Oh what time
is<00:06:13.440> it<00:06:13.590> no<00:06:13.860> all<00:06:14.160> D<00:06:14.310> what<00:06:14.940> our<00:06:15.090> dear<00:06:15.450> okay<00:06:15.870> right

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
uh how many candles you burn in the

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.330 
uh how many candles you burn in the
course<00:06:18.720> yeah<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:19.590> what<00:06:19.770> what's<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.190> answer

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
course yeah so what what's the answer
