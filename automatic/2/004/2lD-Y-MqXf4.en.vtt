00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello people, welcome to our 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 five minutes with buildings and kicks 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.800
 today we are talking about 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 lean building principles systematic 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.160
 challenges in these five minutes we go 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 talk to you about the principles 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 govern construction and kick 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.029
 first I want to talk about what the construction 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.960
 and kick builds kicks is derived from 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.989
 word English on lincon construction 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.440
 or fruit buildings and buildings 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.690
 kicks it started to be thought of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.329
 40s after the Second War 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 world where Toyota is worked on 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.539
 its processes through tai chi and UN 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.559
 xingu and work after the second 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.329
 World War 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.780
 they worked to improve the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.050
 toyota cars factory process 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.280
 At that time Ford had a large 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.250
 car stock 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.369
 their ducks and this pair of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 professionals thought of reducing all 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.260
 waste that happened so that the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 when you arrive at a dealership 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.000
 could request a car and he 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430
 had a minimum stock and could be 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 produced and delivered to the customer within 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 and the company could gain a market 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 in the 90s 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.619
 lauri costa a finnish teacher 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.430
 took this technique that was developed 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.610
 pop and transported and adapted to the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.979
 civil construction where we see that until 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.619
 today we see many companies that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.070
 burst costs burst deadlines 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.530
 reduced logistics quality affected 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.869
 lauri costela thought exactly of 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 this he worked in a way 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.340
 to adapt to this 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.040
 civil construction this is very 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
 very very very perfect about the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.049
 construction generally does not matter 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.099
 whether it is the construction of heavy 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.569
 sanitation works sewage water 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.569
 telecommunications or corporations with the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.350
 sound building constructions 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.300
 lean 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.190
 she adapts because she works in the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.830
 management process 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.990
 she works on how to change the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.900
 a methodological concept that 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.280
 have nowadays and the gains 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.470
 are very large 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.690
 the gains are very large because the work 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.460
 starts working on a line 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.040
 as in your factory in is a 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.930
 factory pros that turns 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.950
 car supplies 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.890
 I find in plastic cars pieces of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.440
 also in construction 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.320
 we also work to define all 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.890
 production line where the chain is affected 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.840
 of logistics where transport 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.840
 vertical horizontal transport 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.180
 stocks are scaled to optimize 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.060
 the entire construction site and the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.690
 will mark the start and end dates of the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.060
 term 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.220
 the development durations of the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.380
 production and the teams they have to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.900
 receive special training to 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.520
 to be able to search within these 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.670
 production to walk 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.490
 according to the flow that is expected and this 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.800
 expected flow this chain of 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.930
 planned planning will cause 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.600
 the work that the company may have 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.970
 positive results 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.760
 is that the whole company wants to 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.970
 a builder can not let the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.730
 its bursting course can not let the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.150
 exceed their limits. 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.090
 and lean construction it will do with 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.430
 that the processes are mapped and can 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.420
 have a very positive result then 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.000
 a systematics is raised a good 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.070
 general analysis of the company is 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.220
 construction and kicking goes into a process 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:06.540
 of maturation comes to be able to make 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.740
 the company has guaranteed results and 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.540
 that's it folks 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.610
 In these minutes we talk to you 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.610
 until the next video there
