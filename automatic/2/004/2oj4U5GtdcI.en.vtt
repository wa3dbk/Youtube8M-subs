00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
about pitching instead of just pitching

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.000 
about pitching instead of just pitching
and<00:04:56.960> it's<00:04:57.050> like<00:04:57.170> he's<00:04:57.320> really<00:04:57.530> going<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.920> go

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
and it's like he's really going to go

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.830 
and it's like he's really going to go
hitter<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:58.700> then<00:04:58.850> you're<00:04:58.970> like<00:04:59.030> that<00:04:59.270> and
