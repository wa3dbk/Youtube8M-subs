I<00:01:39.259> mean<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.219> sophisticated<00:01:41.030> from<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
I mean it's so sophisticated from the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.139 
I mean it's so sophisticated from the
point<00:01:42.439> of<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> technique<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.399> engraving<00:01:43.969> a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
time it still is not overworked it has a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.980 
time it still is not overworked it has a
balance<00:01:53.810> between<00:01:54.229> this

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
dialogue with this thinking of the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.480
