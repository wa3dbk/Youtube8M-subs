hard for me to find this season and
season<00:00:36.090> eight<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.930> both<00:00:37.140> been<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:37.440> hard

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that funny either I mean there were a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
that funny either I mean there were a
few<00:00:52.649> episodes<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> laughed<00:00:53.789> at

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
few episodes in here that I laughed at

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
few episodes in here that I laughed at
but<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.500> most<00:00:55.710> part<00:00:55.920> some<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but you know the most part some of the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.250

Force One with Harrison Ford this is a
good<00:02:38.040> film<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.490> heard<00:02:38.640> somebody<00:02:38.850> talking<00:02:39.210> about

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
good film I heard somebody talking about

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.510 
good film I heard somebody talking about
it<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.930> had<00:02:40.260> never<00:02:40.380> heard<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.130> figured

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
it I had never heard of it so I figured

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.640 
it I had never heard of it so I figured
I'd<00:02:41.640> check<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.450> was<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.660> blind<00:02:42.990> by<00:02:43.320> i

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
I'd check it out it was a blind by i

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.480 
I'd check it out it was a blind by i
think<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.070> was<00:02:44.190> five<00:02:44.610> dollars<00:02:45.060> or<00:02:45.270> something

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
think it was five dollars or something

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.040 
think it was five dollars or something
