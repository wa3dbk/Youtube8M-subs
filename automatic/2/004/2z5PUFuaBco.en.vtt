00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
something but I don't really think the
other<00:01:38.280> team<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.970> GV<00:01:39.240> status<00:01:39.960> or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
other team was like GV status or

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
other team was like GV status or
anything<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.500> they're<00:01:40.950> never<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
anything like that they're never just I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.010
