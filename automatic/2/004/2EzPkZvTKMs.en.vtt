rough dough at that point we're going to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459

use<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> cutter<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.790> cut<00:02:20.090> out<00:02:20.209> little

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
use a cutter and just cut out little

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.880 
use a cutter and just cut out little
shapes<00:02:22.810> now<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.959> find<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.349> sticks<00:02:24.709> like

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
shapes now if you find it sticks like

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
shapes now if you find it sticks like
that<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.819> can<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.450> dip<00:02:26.780> it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
that what you can do is just dip it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.809 
that what you can do is just dip it
straight<00:02:27.230> into<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.560> flower<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.700> will

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
straight into the flower and this will

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.170 
straight into the flower and this will
ensure<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.630> comes<00:02:29.840> out<00:02:29.989> nice<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.260> easy

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.310 

sprinkle<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.330> baking<00:02:36.720> sheet<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> little

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
sprinkle a baking sheet with a little

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.470 
sprinkle a baking sheet with a little
bit<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.650> flour<00:02:37.820> does<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.150> make<00:02:39.270> sure<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
bit of flour does it just make sure that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240 
bit of flour does it just make sure that
they<00:02:39.690> don't<00:02:39.780> stick<00:02:40.110> I'm<00:02:40.530> probably<00:02:40.770> won't<00:02:41.010> but

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
they don't stick I'm probably won't but

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.720 
they don't stick I'm probably won't but
it's<00:02:41.400> worth<00:02:41.610> what<00:02:42.270> I'm<00:02:42.360> doing<00:02:42.540> anyway<00:02:42.840> and
