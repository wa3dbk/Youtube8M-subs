00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
is a good sign and everywhere else looks

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.740 
is a good sign and everywhere else looks
fine<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.069> foundation<00:02:45.580> did<00:02:45.760> rub<00:02:45.970> off<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.210> little

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
fine the foundation did rub off a little

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.100

bit<00:02:47.069> around<00:02:48.069> my<00:02:48.220> nose<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.940> really<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.930> I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
bit around my nose I really like this I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.990 
bit around my nose I really like this I
think<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> perfect<00:02:51.040> foundation<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.610> me

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
think is the perfect foundation for me

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.290 
think is the perfect foundation for me
because<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:53.080> not<00:02:53.410> full<00:02:53.980> coverage<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:55.030> gives

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
because it's not full coverage it gives

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.449 
because it's not full coverage it gives
your<00:02:55.510> skin<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.900> very<00:02:56.080> natural<00:02:56.770> finish<00:02:57.010> but

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
your skin a very natural finish but

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.600 
your skin a very natural finish but
still<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.910> get<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.209> glow<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
still you get that glow and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.910 
still you get that glow and
