 green color chrome logo diary e 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.160
 some writings in Chinese that I leave you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.899
 decipher and in the back the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.789
 company information 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 we open the box we have this drawer 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.660
 and we find the user of ios 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.660
 made however in Chinese language 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.619
 warranty card diary il 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 phone of course we're going to see 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:22.310
 between some and finally data and cable 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:27.619
 USB micro USB charging and charger 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.619
 there was the perfect European format 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.090
 let's see the phone more in the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.200
 detail 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.180
 well what to say he wanted s2 is definitely 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.979
 one of those smartphones that already at first 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.939
 sight and first contact makes you say wow 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.189
 exceptional phil indeed with the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.140
 structure made of plastic and 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.820
 including stainless steel however 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 in fact, enough of everything we are on 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.219
 146 grams including battery of course 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.130
 battery included because the back cover 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.509
 rear is not removable 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.509
 but we want the structure where he had two 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.200
 on the left side we find a bit of everything 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.670
 ie power keys and the two volume keys 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.099
 slot for the entry of the two micro sims 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.099
 the right side is clean except for 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.440
 but of this more linen I show 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:28.160
 here it is a violin of extraction of the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.230
 two slots of the two trays for the micro sims 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.560
 once extracted this violin renders 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.340
 visible the 3.5 mm jack for the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.890
 earphones we sort out I'm afraid that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.010
 be quite lost for and see 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.540
 the back we have nothing else 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.130
 on the sides we have not forgotten 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.110
 anything 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.170
 the back which you see is 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.000
 divided into three sectors in the first of the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.580
 which we find 16 camera 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.950
 megapixel realized by panasonic with 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.170
 led flash and autofocus a camera with 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.540
 opening f 2.2 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.799
 so we've seen better ones from 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.360
 this point of view but anyway 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.230
 we will see how it behaves in the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.980
 full review 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.190
 surrounded by a chrome frame that 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.959
 certainly it is also useful for the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.410
 promotion of its protection 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.630
 as well as a matter of design and 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.590
 the second microphone for reduction 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.850
 of the rustling the central sector is 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.880
 made with a steel body 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.280
 stainless steel on which we find embossed prints 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.790
 and with chrome effect 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.220
 here they are the logo iaio is the name 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.900
 company 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.459
 here is the third one below 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.840
 sector is made of plastic 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.570
 where we find information on the gu 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.940
 of his company with the initials of 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.280
 telephone and system speaker 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.280
 now let's look at the front 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:06.290
 we mention the phone and see that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:13.100
 we find that the dimensions of the iaio s2 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.769
 they are 139 x 67.5 for only 6 mm of 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.370
 thickness is really thick 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.700
 very small look here really is 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.700
 awesome 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.449
 for a total weight as I mentioned in 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.569
 battery precedence included of course 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.030
 of 146 grams on the top part 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.800
 we find the second 8 camera 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.550
 megapixel this time made by 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.130
 sony 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.160
 obviously the earpiece the LED 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.220
 notification and brightness sensor e 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.560
 proximity at the bottom of the three touch keys 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.590
 of which we see the backlight 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.729
 does not look like a backlight 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.919
 very high but we'll see in the review 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.090
 complete maybe even hating 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.520
 with a lower external brightness e 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.349
 obviously in the front part 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.580
 what goes elsewhere the jars as already 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:10.490
 we have said several times is the display from 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.569
 5 inch full hd with 1900 resolution e 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.949
 20 x 1080 pixels which occupies the 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.750
 most of the front surface 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.130
 of the telephone and above all where 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.159
 we find in this frontal part 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.060
 really a lot of side frames 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:28.340
 reduced should be only 1.7 mm 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.810
 just as they are rather small 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.610
 also the other two sections of the part 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.740
 the upper one and the front one 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.449
 lower then a phone that 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.050
 despite 5 inches that are not 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.509
 very few let's remember it has a very good one 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.199
 excellent grip and use grip 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.729
 with one hand for the most part 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.780
 of the functions will surely be 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:54.319
 the display may be made but 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.690
 see the light here the aim is 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:01.969
 set to a very low level 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.990
 we see that this display is from is 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:09.740
 really very very sharp and above all 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:19.099
 very bright I show more from 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:21.340
 near but obviously very fluid 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.340
 touch 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.460
 but we have already said it thanks to 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.950
 presence of the orta core chipset from this 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.150
 point of view have been resolved i 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.470
 problems that we often found on the 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.200
 quad core chipset 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.730
 but unfortunately we have to see from this 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.310
 point of view the autonomy of 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.100
 battery but we will see this at 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.080
 Full review with audio is now 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.230
 almost useless to talk about quality 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.930
 general construction materials that 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.700
 they are always above the average 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.590
 obviously these aspects too will be 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.700
 deepened the complete review 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.130
 but I can tell you that first impressions 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.770
 they are really excellent 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.420
 we said then processor opts cordÃ¬ 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.100
 mediatek because 65 92 from 1.7 gigahertz 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.900
 flanked by 2gb of ram and 32gb of 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.330
 internal memory obviously in this 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.640
 advanced version let's see the 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.200
 internal memory 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.530
 how much is the installation of 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.090
 applications 3.94 gigabytes then 4 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.650
 gigabyte is reserved for installation 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.140
 of the applications in a good 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.020
 compromise and above all much more 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:35.000
 compared to classic gb on the phone is 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:38.030
 installed a version of android 4.2.2 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.400
 with the classic customization that 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.650
 we find lately in smartphones 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.510
 android chinese and on which now not 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.920
 I express myself more because I already have several times 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:52.400
 He said that not particularly iaio has 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.860
 modified some things like how it does of 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.770
 but usually the Roma is 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.210
 that of these others anyway 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.590
 we will talk in detail in the review 

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.000
 complete that will be published in 

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.340
 but I will close it in the next few days 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.140
 thanking again and iaio punto.it 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.000
