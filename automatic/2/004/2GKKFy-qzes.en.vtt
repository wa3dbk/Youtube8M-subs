shape of a loaf of bread using a sharp
knife<00:00:49.470> cut<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.309> dough<00:00:50.460> into<00:00:50.489> several<00:00:50.970> pieces

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
knife cut the dough into several pieces

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.399 
knife cut the dough into several pieces
cut<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.790> many<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.269> few<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.839> but

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
cut as many or as few as you like but

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.200 
cut as many or as few as you like but
the<00:00:55.530> ideal<00:00:55.800> size<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.370> probably<00:00:56.729> around<00:00:56.909> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the ideal size is probably around the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
the ideal size is probably around the
size<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> tennis<00:00:57.780> ball<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.680> no<00:00:58.830> bigger<00:00:59.010> than

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
size of a tennis ball but no bigger than

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.600

a<00:00:59.280> fist<00:01:00.530> roll<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> pieces<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.040> dough<00:01:02.159> out<00:01:02.190> like

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
a fist roll the pieces of dough out like

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.820 
a fist roll the pieces of dough out like
so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.089> generally<00:01:03.870> use<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:04.080> nun<00:01:04.379> floured<00:01:04.799> surface

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so I generally use a nun floured surface

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.890 
so I generally use a nun floured surface
as<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.030> stickiness<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.750> your

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
as a little bit of stickiness as your

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
as a little bit of stickiness as your
friend<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.380> you're<00:01:07.530> rolling<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.090> too

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
friend when you're rolling them out too

friend when you're rolling them out too
much<00:01:09.240> flour<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> dough<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.350> merely

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
much flour and the dough will merely

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.310 
much flour and the dough will merely
slide<00:01:10.890> back<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.130> forth<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.750> fix<00:01:12.930> any<00:01:13.110> odd

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

slide back and forth you can fix any odd
bits<00:01:13.620> by<00:01:14.070> rolling<00:01:14.370> them<00:01:14.460> between<00:01:14.760> your<00:01:14.970> hands

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.940 

now<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> knot<00:01:21.560> first<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
now to make the knot first make a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.340 
now to make the knot first make a
horseshoe<00:01:23.400> shape

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.770 

then<00:01:27.979> twist<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> ends<00:01:29.210> around<00:01:29.270> each<00:01:29.570> other

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
then twist the ends around each other

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.740 
then twist the ends around each other
and<00:01:30.490> fold<00:01:31.490> them<00:01:31.580> over<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:35.180> takes<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.450> little<00:01:35.600> bit

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
and fold them over it takes a little bit

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.859 
and fold them over it takes a little bit
of<00:01:35.810> practice<00:01:37.270> press<00:01:38.270> them<00:01:38.420> against<00:01:38.780> the

of practice press them against the
opposite<00:01:39.320> side<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.830> your<00:01:42.950> pretzel

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
opposite side and you have your pretzel

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
opposite side and you have your pretzel
I<00:01:45.190> sometimes<00:01:46.190> have<00:01:46.399> trouble<00:01:46.549> rolling<00:01:46.880> out<00:01:47.149> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
I sometimes have trouble rolling out the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.910 
I sometimes have trouble rolling out the
dough<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.659> those<00:01:48.020> bits<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.320> onion<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.799> garlic

dough and those bits of onion and garlic

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.279 
dough and those bits of onion and garlic
don't<00:01:49.340> make<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.610> any<00:01:49.789> easier<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.720> lot<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
don't make it any easier so a lot of the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.109 
don't make it any easier so a lot of the
time<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.680> end<00:01:51.890> up<00:01:52.009> rolling<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.430> out<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.940> air

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
time I end up rolling it out in the air

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.050 
time I end up rolling it out in the air
between<00:01:53.450> my<00:01:53.690> hands<00:01:53.899> like<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:55.060> there's

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
between my hands like this there's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.399 
between my hands like this there's
nothing<00:01:56.390> wrong<00:01:56.539> with<00:01:56.600> rolling<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:57.140> out<00:01:57.200> this

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
nothing wrong with rolling it out this

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.080 
nothing wrong with rolling it out this
way<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.950> have<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.220> be<00:01:58.340> careful<00:01:58.520> not<00:01:58.759> to

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
let the dough fall apart now some

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.600 
let the dough fall apart now some
recipes<00:02:03.440> tell<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.950> let<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> pretzels

rise<00:02:04.819> before<00:02:05.179> you<00:02:05.420> boil<00:02:05.659> them<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.110> some<00:02:06.649> have

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
rise before you boil them and some have

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.550 
rise before you boil them and some have
you<00:02:07.009> drop<00:02:07.220> them<00:02:07.399> straight<00:02:07.670> into<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.909> water<00:02:08.179> I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
you drop them straight into the water I

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.800 
you drop them straight into the water I
prefer<00:02:09.560> boiling<00:02:10.250> them<00:02:10.369> immediately<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.600> i'll

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
prefer boiling them immediately but i'll

prefer boiling them immediately but i'll
show<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.050> how<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.290> do<00:02:12.470> both<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.640> ones

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
