00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.009
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.020
 go well today I make you a 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.230
 small just a little video 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 rather how to do a trick in 1 8 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.189
 unusual so it's gone as predict 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 just downstairs so that really made me 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.400
 to laugh because I imagined myself 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.519
 something quite different than 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 I could propose for the moment so 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.369
 I just wanted you really 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.780
 to make you laugh is when happens 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.570
 frankly they say of the big 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 eight motorcycle so the Ferris wheel I do not 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.719
 could not go up unfortunately but 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 implies big eight question there that it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.149
 really made me laugh we are 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.860
 could really do a lot of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 little things pretty nice so I 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.129
 I said I want to door 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 thresholds my subscribers directly made in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.649
 do this cable now it's like that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 that I want to do earlier but video 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.379
 it's a lot more interesting to see 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.699
 a person in front who by the little ones 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 dialogues that was and it's like that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 you will also be able to follow a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010
 little bit more but how did you arrive 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.719
 more live it will put you a little bit 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 more of the atmosphere I think I saw 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.589
 that it really has you more first 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 once I did a little live on gta 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.920
 it made me really happy too 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.540
 to have an audience who is there who you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 supports who supports you who me 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 support forgiveness that supports you who me 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.060
 support it's really nice of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.229
 ability to interact with subscribers 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 directly also face to face as 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.460
 season really it finally arises a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.840
 face on a lane so a face that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 remains a face so I'm not here for 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.720
 to please I am not here to displease I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.460
 I do not care about this kind of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 little bullshit my globe you could 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.920
 see that the iem price is really nice 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.270
 also not veiled very very gently 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.159
 do not rush 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 because if you go too fast there is 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 an imminent risk of falling and for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.320
 to be able to do it's manipulation to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 sam to cancale m34 and it's good I'll 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.930
 not lie to you I did not do everything from 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.009
 following the first blow I told myself 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.549
 I take the bike to see 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.200
 is it technically 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.329
 feasible or not I was still 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.159
 surprised to my great satisfaction it's 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.780
 possible and even time the frog 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.070
 I tested for two hours then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.600
 Unfortunately, I did not succeed 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 would have been really nice to be able to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.700
 just wander with the bike 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.170
 by doing the Ferris wheel and after doing 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.729
 a waterfall so it's not necessarily 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.229
 so avoiding there it's still 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.130
 obviously not bad so here I get everything 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.509
 simply destination so the big 8 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.920
 knots it's not right now in 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.530
 walking one unfortunately so after 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.110
 it is you who pay so of course you have 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.760
 matured very ungrateful screw so I do not know 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.380
 marsh frankly in multiplayer that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.730
 background return the circuit you saw 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 I simply returned that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.190
 the bike is there we redo the path arias 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.270
 we use it pours sooner so there is 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.380
 a lot of little things like that to 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.090
 to arise late that's why I you 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.950
 say this game I can not afford 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.240
 to be able to finish it so here I am 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.500
 arrived at good port so friends I you 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.300
 say to you very soon, be well and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.930
 do not worry there is doubt video that 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.010
 is coming soon 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 go for a cake
