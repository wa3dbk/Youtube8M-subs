00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:38.380
 it was good and I think it was a lot and 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.020
 so a little more neighbor my 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.580

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.590

 certain operations as I do not know how 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.709
 [Applause] 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.730
 You leave there, it's going to be dry and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.510
 after drying 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.549
 you will see the difference is that it does not touch 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.849
 How do you know leather is skin, right? 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.139
 too late until after and like everything 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.420

 animal 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.250
 so you do it there will increase the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.379
 lifespan 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.579
 the durability of your car 's seat 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.389
