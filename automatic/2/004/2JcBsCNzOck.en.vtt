00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.879
 ovo high school I took bus way every night 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:18.110
 for two weeks I went there for 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.110
 this girl 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.929
 I live in a town next to gueret 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.089
 called marc a max eric g at 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.300
 High School in Calais so in this school is 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.810
 must be a lot much kevin of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.379
 Mark 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.020
 there is only one problem is that there is 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.860
 airbus case of the living which for us 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 but then over there you Calais daughter marc 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 initially from bed here at my house from 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.879
 life if your house you say it's all 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 the houses in marc nobs spend the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.309
 problem actually because we all end up 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.030
 at the same time 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.050
 18 hours 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.340
 where it hurts the eyes there is no 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.330
 only one goal in fact no I'm 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.619
 sorry I made a mistake 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.259
 and that's the second but twenty 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 minutes to walk 20 minutes 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.070
 when it's sunny 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.649
 a 15 minutes when it rains you 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.430
 course actually me personally when 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.440
 it's raining I'm used to running 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.140
 and it's not that it's a ride and 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.750
 this good you do not run do you 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.409
 course you can most already in class 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.920
 when it's sunny 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.570
 and yes I thought it's bad 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 run on the pub because you touch 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.860
 more than god 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.200
 This is all the more worse is while 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:48.909
 more finish in the rain there are three 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:53.020
 types of people wolverine January 1st 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.090
 course with or without protection for the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:03.390
 sort of there I think about k way it reminds me 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 the airy center I explain you even 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.810

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:22.730
 hood permeable do you want the case 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.560
 since ol wants because in fact the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.380
 job 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.470

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.750
 household at the same palin the third day 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.360
 it's the ones who have an umbrella that 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.480
 That is the class 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.430
 it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.510
 for the first jeans all know the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.489
 umbrella of the third kind is often 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.170
 water second kind eh ben he 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.860
 splashes those who are below the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.860
 fruit of the 3rd time since here drÃ´me 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.750
 households has like that in any case the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.910

 guests what class yeah I do not know 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.739
 if it's you it's the same but at 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.739
 you 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.480
 it stinks the buzzard and that to 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.110
 inside that we feel a little 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:26.420
 little yorkshire moon 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:28.190
 this hotel even makes it say amen 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.300

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.209
 new ppu that they proved to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.209
 inside and out 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.060
 let's go back to our goats 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.830
 this second bus take it in case of 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.590
 force majeure you do not take it was not 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.910
 not bad though not 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.470
 at the end of the year new this year 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.629
 is that the driver is he who 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.590
 decide if still at this place in the 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:15.200
 bus because the door but you tell yourself is pledge 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.729
 val opus far the ball at the jump of the coup 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.310
 we who are in the bus and butter 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.650
 non-sovereigns of the seven who are 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.750
 the other side you see under the drizzle skip 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.300
 yes he cries cry yeah Calais 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.160
 you have a problem is flunked so it 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.690
 it's raining that we do not care about them because 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.610
 that they are in the rain and on the walls 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.479
 the portraits are formed we start to 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:42.919
 leave but they are finally phoning to 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.720
 their parents nor so that's it 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.740
 back against us because people 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.810
 they are waiting for their parents now 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.880
 therefore, the six months that we 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.620
 who are crushed against each other 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.250
 some and we will not take but 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.259
 placed in this bus you some 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.479
 advice is a tip for you 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.870
 like that that even though top 50 and 2 or 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.910
 and break bars in canada and 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:11.430
 that the driver has baha drivers 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.630
 here roles a little fair and suddenly when 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.940
 he not on the big point 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.770
 because yes he does not take the volume 2 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.770
 ramps online it's still true 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.509
 when it's a small world is what the 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.110
 often mark little words like that 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.699
 of 19 years for the benign and the driver 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.760
 for six years have all right and from 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.710
 fight you want 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:37.300
 those who are there civic in senegal and 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.300
 it's even worse when cornering 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:47.569
 because they would do better everything and everything 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.840
 mounted and suddenly everything is double in fact 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.240
