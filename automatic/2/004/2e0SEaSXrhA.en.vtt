most people do well what I've got is
I've<00:00:19.050> got<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> model<00:00:19.800> right<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I've got a model right here that I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.400 
I've got a model right here that I
finished<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.000> I've<00:00:21.270> done<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> friend's

finished up I've done it for a friend's
map<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.840> he<00:00:24.840> likes<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.710> I'm<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
map and he likes it so what I'm going to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.800 
map and he likes it so what I'm going to
go<00:00:26.310> ahead<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.519> start<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> skin<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
go ahead and start with the skin on it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929

I've<00:00:28.439> already<00:00:28.680> done<00:00:28.980> everything<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.609> just

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I've already done everything I'm just

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.009 
I've already done everything I'm just
going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> go<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.390> through<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.689> show<00:00:30.960> you

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
going to go back through and show you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.889 
going to go back through and show you
how<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.940> what<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.780> remember

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
how I do it what you have to remember

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
how I do it what you have to remember
first<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:35.309> model<00:00:35.610> cannot<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.270> any

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
first is that your model cannot have any

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.100 
first is that your model cannot have any
parts<00:00:37.640> UVW<00:00:38.640> map<00:00:38.820> Dover<00:00:39.149> themselves<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:39.899> else

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
parts UVW map Dover themselves or else

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.020 
parts UVW map Dover themselves or else
the<00:00:40.379> shadings<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.579> kinds<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the shadings going to go all kinds of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
the shadings going to go all kinds of
crazy<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.230> always<00:00:43.829> does<00:00:43.860> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
crazy on you it always does this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.760 
crazy on you it always does this
something<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> help<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.320> easiest<00:00:46.680> way

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
something you can help the easiest way

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
something you can help the easiest way
to<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> too

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to do it is if you have to you too

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
to do it is if you have to you too
mirror<00:00:49.620> anything<00:00:50.420> you<00:00:51.420> make<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.770> copy<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.949> your

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
mirror anything you make a copy of your

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.310 
mirror anything you make a copy of your
model<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.059> I've<00:00:54.270> done<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> two

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
model like I've done this is two

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
model like I've done this is two
separate<00:00:55.710> parts<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> hide<00:00:56.850> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
separate parts so I'm going to hide this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.920 
separate parts so I'm going to hide this
and<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.510> unhide<00:00:58.230> by<00:00:58.620> name<00:00:59.270> I've<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> group

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and then unhide by name I've got a group

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.889 
and then unhide by name I've got a group
here<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.699> model<00:01:02.879> without<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
here that's the model without the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
here that's the model without the
mirrored<00:01:04.199> parts<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> fins<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> ad<00:01:05.640> are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
mirrored parts the fins and the ad are

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.190 
mirrored parts the fins and the ad are
mirrored<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.110> i<00:01:08.600> went<00:01:09.600> ahead<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.869> group<00:01:10.170> them

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
mirrored so i went ahead and group them

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
mirrored so i went ahead and group them
made<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> second<00:01:11.189> version<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.210> only

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
made a second version where there's only

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.530 
made a second version where there's only
one<00:01:12.659> AD<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.260> fins<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> look<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.330> its

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
one AD and the fins if you look how its

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.120 
one AD and the fins if you look how its
black<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.140> does<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.520> model<00:01:18.270> there

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
black here does it have the model there

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
black here does it have the model there
now<00:01:20.130> I've<00:01:20.400> colored<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:22.020> there's<00:01:22.530> two

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
now I've colored it because there's two

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.080 
now I've colored it because there's two
different<00:01:22.860> ways<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
different ways you can do it one is you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
different ways you can do it one is you
render<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.570> black<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.170> white<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.830> then

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
render it out black and white and then

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.670 
render it out black and white and then
use<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> black<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.150> white<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> normal<00:01:28.470> map

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
use the black and white as a normal map

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.039 
use the black and white as a normal map
which<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.280> tend<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.329> makes<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> look<00:01:30.810> nice

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
which I tend to do it makes it look nice

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.429 
which I tend to do it makes it look nice
give<00:01:31.320> us<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.619> grain<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.439> can

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
give us a little grain to it so I can

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.670 
give us a little grain to it so I can
deal<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.409> I've

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
deal with it this right here I've

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 
deal with it this right here I've
actually<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.250> colored<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.030> are

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
actually got colored because these are

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.490 
actually got colored because these are
the<00:01:39.270> colors<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> like

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the colors I want to do it which is like

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
the colors I want to do it which is like
a<00:01:40.650> beige<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> silver<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.210> silver<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> going

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
a beige and a silver the silver is going

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.980 
a beige and a silver the silver is going
to<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.439> reflective<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> game<00:01:44.990> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to be actually reflective in game so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.649 
to be actually reflective in game so
what<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.829> first<00:01:47.360> since<00:01:48.360> I've<00:01:48.509> got

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
what I want to do first since I've got

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
10 minutes for me because I've been

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.020 
10 minutes for me because I've been
doing<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.560> couple<00:04:55.950> things<00:04:56.130> on<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.580> off<00:04:56.669> trying

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
doing a couple things on and off trying

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.909 
doing a couple things on and off trying
to<00:04:57.090> make<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.389> work<00:04:57.570> right<00:04:57.810> because<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.470> was<00:04:58.620> not

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
to make it work right because it was not

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.790 
to make it work right because it was not
wanting<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.479> now<00:05:00.479> when<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.110> render<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.590> err

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
wanting to now when you render it err

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.560 
wanting to now when you render it err
probably<00:05:02.370> going<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.669> get<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.789> square<00:05:03.150> no<00:05:03.389> matter

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570

probably going to get a square no matter
what<00:05:03.960> size<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.289> do<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.860> don't<00:05:05.460> worry<00:05:05.850> about

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
what size you do it don't worry about

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.170 
what size you do it don't worry about
that<00:05:06.419> because<00:05:06.780> when<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.560> render<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.760> keeps<00:05:09.030> it

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
that because when you render it keeps it

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.700 
that because when you render it keeps it
in<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.300> same<00:05:09.510> window<00:05:09.870> yet<00:05:10.080> when<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.350> open<00:05:10.590> in

you'll notice it's 1024 x 512 you'll

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.589 
you'll notice it's 1024 x 512 you'll
notice<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:19.860> a<00:05:20.010> little<00:05:20.490> bit<00:05:20.610> brushed<00:05:20.880> over<00:05:21.090> on

see<00:07:32.300> normal<00:07:32.629> mapping<00:07:32.839> on<00:07:33.169> the<00:07:35.949> lights<00:07:36.949> because

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.370 
see normal mapping on the lights because

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.510 
see normal mapping on the lights because
I<00:07:37.669> did<00:07:37.849> them<00:07:38.000> in<00:07:38.169> my<00:07:39.169> texture<00:07:39.710> editor<00:07:39.800> I<00:07:40.009> do<00:07:40.219> put

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 
I did them in my texture editor I do put

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.589 
I did them in my texture editor I do put
a<00:07:40.550> little<00:07:40.729> bit<00:07:40.849> of<00:07:40.909> work<00:07:41.060> and<00:07:41.180> I<00:07:41.240> like<00:07:41.389> you<00:07:41.479> be

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 
a little bit of work and I like you be

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.499 
a little bit of work and I like you be
like<00:07:41.719> there's<00:07:41.990> fins<00:07:42.759> have<00:07:43.759> lighting<00:07:44.210> on<00:07:44.360> them

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:44.509 
like there's fins have lighting on them

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:46.360 
like there's fins have lighting on them
I<00:07:44.750> touched<00:07:45.169> up<00:07:45.379> the<00:07:45.560> bottom<00:07:45.949> a<00:07:46.009> little<00:07:46.129> bit

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.370 
I touched up the bottom a little bit

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.339 
I touched up the bottom a little bit
gave<00:07:46.550> it<00:07:46.669> a<00:07:46.729> more<00:07:46.909> mentally<00:07:47.419> texture<00:07:48.080> for<00:07:48.259> the

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349 
gave it a more mentally texture for the

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:50.499 
gave it a more mentally texture for the
carriage<00:07:48.740> but<00:07:49.580> yeah<00:07:49.759> that's<00:07:49.939> pretty<00:07:50.150> much<00:07:50.330> all

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:50.509 
carriage but yeah that's pretty much all

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:52.950 
carriage but yeah that's pretty much all
you've<00:07:50.659> really<00:07:51.139> gotta<00:07:51.289> do<00:07:51.439> to<00:07:51.529> get<00:07:51.620> some<00:07:51.680> AO

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 
you've really gotta do to get some AO

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.229 
you've really gotta do to get some AO
catch<00:07:53.960> you<00:07:54.199> later
