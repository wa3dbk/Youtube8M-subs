00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 today we are going to make burgers 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.470
 to the fundamental component amatriciana 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.870
 to respond to the matriciana I am 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.030
 mailed so let's go buy some 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.969
 of bucatini then we need 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.520
 we also need bacon 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.900
 pecorino those in other things that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.859
 let's go lick first thing first 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.820
 put in a word a drop of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.340
 oil and bacon and we go to them 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.019
 brown south then we will follow the room 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 small thing before you do this though 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.280
 we put the water to boil 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.649
 rightly if we want to be 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.210
 impoverished so let's take a nice e 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.180
 let's go brown first 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.879
 let's get the water heated for i 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.219
 bucatini and while the water boils for the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.640
 bucatino we are going to prepare the sauce for 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.760
 the mother called to brown until the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.699
 bacon does not become transparent when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 the class will become transparent we'll go 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.850
 to add a half glass 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.460
 glass of white wine 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 we are browning the pancetta until 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.299
 we have to play the point we have to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.090
 regular let's say three minutes 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.130
 pina that the fat does not become 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.960
 transparent when fat does not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.259
 feed the hurry we will add 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.299
 a couple of fingers of wine series to where it can 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.180
 ok we reasoned well our 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.840
 let's add bacon two fingers of 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.840
 Red wine 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.910
 and let it brown over medium heat here a 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.910
 which does not evaporate the wine 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.290
 well at this point let's go to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.920
 add a little bit of black pepper and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.110
 then also some chilli in place 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.710
 he calls himself to anger but that makes us pure 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.710
 in chilli 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.390
 at this point the fun part 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.060
 of the fifteenth century we are always talking 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.190
 of doses for a single person 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.620
 so we put on 70 grams of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.710
 accept and shortly to the month and a half 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.340
 tomatoes jar however tomatoes 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.200
 they should be chopped I recommend 15 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.190
 you have to take the tomatoes and break them 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.220
 so with your hands well at this point 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.959
 the tomato will have things up here for one 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.760
 ten minutes being the barilla 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.310
 it only takes 8 minutes 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.670
 we begin to cook first and the como 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.850
 north then we think the tomato above and 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.850
 we cook about ten of them 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.489
 so we said more or less minutes 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.709
 meanwhile we can take e 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.540
 throw the bucatini inside first 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.760
 we are going to salt them not much because 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.820
 because it already tasty in itself 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.830
 our subject then we take i 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:10.310
 bucatini we put them in and we do 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.730
 cook the bucatini in the meantime on fire 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.130
 average 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.130
 let's cook a little too much on the side 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.170
 let's do some go to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:28.989
 add to our south 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:36.519
 we mix and add half of the 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:39.120
 our pecorino the premetal we will go to 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.120
 to add 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.950
 and in the final we are going to serve ours 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:57.150
 carbonara and add in one last 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.739
 sprinkle with pecorino if we remove it 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.860
 pecorino romano 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.099
 all for our challenges 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.459
 like spicy not him 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.790
 and then enjoy your meal with bucatini 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.290
 amatriciana 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.470
 I would like with doses per 100 grams of 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.840
 bucatini 40 g of smoked pancetta 100 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.200
