eyelashes<00:00:33.050> trying<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> rub<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> off<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
eyelashes trying to rub it off and I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.160 
eyelashes trying to rub it off and I

I<00:00:40.350> makeup<00:00:41.070> remover<00:00:41.489> um<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.059> figured<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.079> would

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I makeup remover um so I figured I would

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.819 
I makeup remover um so I figured I would
try<00:00:46.500> an<00:00:47.010> alternative<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.289> figured<00:00:49.710> out

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
try an alternative and I figured out

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
try an alternative and I figured out
that<00:00:51.410> baby<00:00:52.410> oil<00:00:53.030> actually<00:00:54.030> works<00:00:54.270> um<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that baby oil actually works um so I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
that baby oil actually works um so I
wanted<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> show<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.500> guys<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.399> AOL

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you want and you just pretty much make

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.499 
you want and you just pretty much make
like<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.220> line<00:01:20.780> going<00:01:21.780> across<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.799> cotton<00:01:23.189> pad

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
like a line going across the cotton pad

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.149 
like a line going across the cotton pad
probably<00:01:24.509> can't<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.979> see

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
probably can't see it but you can see

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.740 
probably can't see it but you can see
where<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> moisture<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
where they like the moisture is on the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.569 
where they like the moisture is on the
pad<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.740> you'd<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.350> then

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
pad so you'd make it like that and then

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.730 
pad so you'd make it like that and then
you<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> take<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:34.020> hand<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> line

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you want to take it in one hand and line

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.440 
you want to take it in one hand and line
up<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.920> fingers<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:36.240> where<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.290> line<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450

and we just make your eyelashes stick
together<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.460> freaking<00:02:24.970> crazy<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.070> just

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
together like freaking crazy so you just

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.420 
together like freaking crazy so you just
keep<00:02:27.370> doing<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:28.110> usually<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:30.130> would<00:02:30.250> only

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
keep doing that usually you would only

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.980 
keep doing that usually you would only
need<00:02:30.700> Pollock<00:02:31.240> one<00:02:32.430> cotton<00:02:33.430> pad<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.750> can<00:02:34.780> do

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
need Pollock one cotton pad you can do

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.190 
need Pollock one cotton pad you can do
this<00:02:35.110> with<00:02:35.170> regular<00:02:35.860> mascara<00:02:36.100> too<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:37.630> guess<00:02:38.050> it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
this with regular mascara too I guess it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800 
this with regular mascara too I guess it
would<00:02:38.320> be<00:02:38.440> cheaper<00:02:39.060> considering<00:02:40.060> you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
would be cheaper considering you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.610 
would be cheaper considering you
wouldn't<00:02:41.080> have<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.470> baby<00:02:41.710> oil<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:43.620> I'm

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
wouldn't have to have baby oil and I'm

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.840 
wouldn't have to have baby oil and I'm
eye<00:02:44.770> makeup<00:02:45.370> remover<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.530> yeah<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.580> works

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
eye makeup remover so yeah it works

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.690 
eye makeup remover so yeah it works
really<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.360> well<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.500> guess<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:51.040> also

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
really really well and I guess it also

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.640 
really really well and I guess it also
gives<00:02:52.120> your<00:02:52.620> eyelashes<00:02:53.620> some<00:02:53.890> moisture<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.530> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
gives your eyelashes some moisture so it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.220 
gives your eyelashes some moisture so it
helps<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.890> get<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.600> once<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.020> see

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
helps you get with that so once you see

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.830 
helps you get with that so once you see
that<00:02:59.260> you've<00:02:59.860> gotten<00:03:00.160> most<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.700> off<00:03:00.850> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that you've gotten most of it off you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.710 
that you've gotten most of it off you
can<00:03:01.990> take<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.470> Kleenex<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:04.510> wrap<00:03:04.690> your
