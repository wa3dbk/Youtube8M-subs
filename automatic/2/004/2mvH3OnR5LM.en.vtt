00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.290
 second time and I confirmed the drawing 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:23.820
 that the only thing that asks me is the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:26.400
 another question is who else but you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.170
 you do not know is also engaged but 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.170
 who is more so hired 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:50.120
 Do you think that because they play for having 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:54.260
 played there is let go of the goblet you are 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.359
 professional player does not have the club 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.340
 professional player and ended this season 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.880
 the professional player has no 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.380
 strictly in the temple where he was 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
 kissing Basque's shirt to finish 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.490
 kissing the other's shirt and also 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.509
 soccer player 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.270
 the player is professional and has no club 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.180
 so it does not have that player label 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.140
 Flemish Flemish Flemish Flemish 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.670
 on the contrary, it is because it is what we 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.070
 We're seeing this one, actually. 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.200
 being brought reinforcements that they are 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.180
 giving the Basque Team 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 this is the truth then embodying the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:56.960
 I do not see players who can 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.719
 to immediately add really be 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 something more in the sense that 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.979
 released the accumulated game list and the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.610
 idea is a body to the Basque team and also 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.610
 for panda
