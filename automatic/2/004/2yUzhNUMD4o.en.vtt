00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.939
 I'm going to talk to you in terms of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
 composition to fix or compose a 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.980
 melody 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.280
 This is a melody has to go past 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.340
 over certain chords this usually 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.460
 it's not always like that sometimes a melody 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.200
 can go perfectly isolated from what 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.810
 is the progression of chords and 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.590
 we just need to start with two 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 things a a scale where to move and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 two at least with a couple of notes 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.749
 now this is the easiest thing we can 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.120
 do and the difficult step is the creation 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.190
 of the melody so let's start 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.569
 thinking that we do not have progression of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.760
 chords simply by creating one now me 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.620
 I will choose two notes and I will choose 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 the guitar as an instrument but you're 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 notes can be a bass guitar 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.399
 acoustic a piano 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.699
 it can be anything even the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.319
 same voice so you do not because I 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.660
 do it guitar means that this 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:05.269
 explanation be for 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.950
 and not take it as that is an explanation 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.560
 of music in general well the notes that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.910
 I will choose are rating because 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 simply because those two I wanted them 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.130
 touch well 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.530
 these are my two notes now 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.780
 I'm going to decide how many times it's going to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.880
 have between each one of them I'm going to 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.340
 put an example where they last 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.229
 four times all for 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.470
 with 23 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:44.729
 it's that simple now let's suppose 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 What I want to do is to create 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.080
 a melody around these two notes 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.049
 Well, what can I do? 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.680
 adding notes of the scale to this 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.659
 melody now a way to do it can 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.659
 be 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.659
 2. 3 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.530
 where my again entered the 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.350
 first time of the second measure 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.410
 in the compass of re I added two notes that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.959
 they are the two sharp and the king again and 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.650
 this can start to create a feeling of 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:26.410
 a more complete melody then already of 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.410
 here you can start all 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.800
 now let's assume that this is the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.740
 complete melody for all the part that 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.810
 we want to do and this melody the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.420
 we want to articulate in different ways 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.460
 So what we can do is start 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.360
 to play with the variations of the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.410
 times like it would be good an idea would be 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.420
 with the same notes touching 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.420
 which all together 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.200
 here I am giving several examples and I am going to 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.080
 continue 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.080
 juntitos 35 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.690
 33 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.249
 2. 3 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.940
 now it is in melody that simple 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.050
 I can think of adding more 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.650
 notes if it altered our rhythms 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.650
 two 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.260
 now these are ways to vary not only 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.629
 the structure in terms of times but 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.830
 as for the same melody adding or 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.790
 removing notes 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.550
 I can have melodies that comply with 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.770
 the function of asking answer this 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.930
 is 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:00.530
 I can have all three points 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.530
 such 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.900
 2. 3 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.959
 two 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.799
 when where the second round I did it 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.450
 with other notes that instead of ascending 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.329
 descended and this gives me the feeling of 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.049
 question-answer and this is one of 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.020
 so many tricks or tricks that can be 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.750
 do when creating melodies go 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.690
 creating with the descending part another 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.000
 ascending and that way we are 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.110
 creating a dialogue with the same melody 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.720
 and that musically sounds very attractive 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.330
 there are currently groups or interpreters that 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.639
 they just have the same melody all 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.639
 the song is to say the best this 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.600
 several times and several times without paying 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.850
 until they change the melody or until 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.830
 a new rhythmic part arrives or even 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.590
 if you can go the whole piece then 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.480
 This is very simple and what I want is 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.800
 give them tools to do something 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.289
 more varied now 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.479
 and so you are going to put chords 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.300
 this melody have to choose chords 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.879
 that go harmonizing perfectly with 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.190
 the notes where you want them and 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.460
 this also depends on the style that 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.860
 go to compose not in all styles 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.750
 it can be done in the same way and with 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.479
 the same notes or with the same 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.720
 rhythms there are more complex styles there 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.960
 simpler styles now in the 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.240
 complexity two simple of each style 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.509
 is the complexity or simplicity of 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.509
 melody 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.300
 you can choose rhythms much more dishes 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.009
 those of counting and measuring and this with the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.200
 same notes can you give me what styles 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.480
 much more interesting but 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.820
 the notes of the melody can be 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.860
 even the same ones now 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.490
 in the same way I can simplify the 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.420
 melody to the maximum so that this one has 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:08.290
 a very simple life very short but to the 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.290
 very fluid time 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.539
 and that's it, then this can be 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.970
 a melody for any style 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.090
 depending on which chords of metal or 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.639
 background if I put them with distortions in 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.120
 the methods without distortion if I want a 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:31.469
 more pop style if you want a style more and 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.090
 bossanova more with one more day whatever 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:36.879
 depending on the style I want you 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.759
 I'm going to give an instrumentation that 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:42.099
 complement that style either by 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.539
 example , if I use a cumbia or you 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.900
 I'm going to put an accordion I'm going to put 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:49.000
 a bass a drums drum and if 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.789
 has a heavy metal I'm going to put 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.419
 electric guitar maybe a keyboard 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:58.120
 bass and drums and obviously these 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.770
 last with distortion especially in the 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.569
 case of the electric guitar and in the 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.360
 case of heavy metal cumbia is going to be 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.849
 the clean tone and so on then of those 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.090
 ways we're going to wear the melodies 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:12.310
 that we go creating but all part of 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.960
 two points with the note with which 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.110
 we started in the note with which 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.630
 we finish and the rest is to go 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.180
 interconnecting 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.190
 the notes of the scale the notes that 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.410
 they happen to us and little by little we go 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.020
 to create melodies more and more 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.750
 interesting and more complete so 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.610
 experiment with this little tip for 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.030
 that you can create your own 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.030
 ideas
