00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.810
 They can see me better so I do not see the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.830
 they see that person on the block 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 hunters who have to find us 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.930
 among so many blocks there is so 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.840
 time to hide and do a bit of 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.140
 trolls and funny moves right now they're going to 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.809
 see here there is already a bookstore walking like 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.390
 how come and well guys sometimes we 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.250
 will be the hunter but it is very little 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.770
 very few probabilities that 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.820
 let's start this being the hunter yes yes 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.950
 they are high what 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.850
 little by little we are growing more and more 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.410
 but it's the fun they have to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.370
 hide is hide and seek 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.470
 hide and find them in something 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.540
 well and good guys I'm going to leave the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.780
 ipl to 10 descriptions of this app 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.430
 they arrive in the words that have passed 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.590
 If you can see it, the bad thing is that I do not 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.670
 I can place well I move a little and if 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.280
 this list moves a lot but 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.110
 perfect not but almost almost and good 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.140
 guys another thing I wanted to tell you is 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.130
 which they are four servers 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.620
 blood hunter so the server is called and 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.300
 Well, it's great because that's how they can 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.729
 enter more people in the afternoons are 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.090
 very full but now like at 9 10 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.950
 the night was very empty just the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.259
 leaving after so long I do not know 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.600
 why is it happening so good guys are we going to 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.810
 throw to make a little sauce here 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.270
 I am a walking punishment table and yes that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.210
 he has a few books around here that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.130
 when you are walking and you stay 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.470
 stuck in the grass so I hope that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.770
 do not see anything very casual a table 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.680
 punishment here in the middle of everything and there 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.200
 comes comes comes comes there comes remains 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.080
 stuck we make him mess let's go too 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.570
 that we can give we have a sword and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.040
 well we have killed it too I can 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.750
 kill some and we're going 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.790
 running here because if you follow me they're not going 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.320
 to find so nothing guys if I 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.120
 kill I become one of them and 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.890
 Now you can observe it better only 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.890
 you are putting me shot 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.170
 of game because you can troll those who 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.780
 they are hunting a lot a lot there we are 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.590
 I'm not the champion of 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 blockbusters I'm the champion who hits him 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.040
 I hit him and he's not going to turn me into one 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.140
 of them I do not want to be one of them 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.670
 let's go from here and now with something else 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.500
 I wanted to tell you that I'm not going to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.090
 a lot if they want to win but I do not 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 like to be changing to me and good 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.520
 guys I think that day and also and I 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.160
 I'm pulling here we go let's go and 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.510
 We make mess no longer eyes as they can 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.090
 see I became one of them and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 now we have to find the blocks to 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.920
 us so let's try to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.300
 find these games and take a little 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.950
 and it's more because sometimes they can not 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.990
 find one that hides very well 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.360
 or climb up and do not see it like that 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.550
 that nothing guys we will try to look for without 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.600
 stay stuck in the covenant that I 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.430
 it's happening very well they're giving me 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.140
 solutions and I do not want that I do not want 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.210
 give me convulsions to see if this does not 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.740
 it's a crisis table me and a weird thing 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.840
 what happens to me is that when I find 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.290
 to one and hit him class me to the server 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.090
 so if that happens I'm going to finish the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.950
 video I just wanted to go in to show you 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.190
 how is the move going so they did not know 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.050
 if you already know is going to be a great 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.510
 the experience that they are going to have since 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.550
 this game is very very funny inside 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.040
 the people here do not love that and good 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.260
 guys we're here watching you do not see 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.720
 nobody for now let's go here 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.140
 ok this kraft table makes me 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.150
 suspect do not be called crazy not good it 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.160
 call me and what are we going to look for more 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.840
 here now do not get stuck and there 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.020
 Many local tables are not 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.720
 I understand I think they are all real 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.440
 because I that that I hit him I'm 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.160
 hitting 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.890
 wei wei wei I'm hitting this one on 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:29.720
 this one was that but we've caught 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:32.330
 to our first as you would say the first 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.760
 hidden as it is said and good so 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.250
 let's continue here and if you want to play 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.960
 with friends you can tell them in which 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.180
 it would look like it's going to be is more is more 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.440
 fun with friends I will tell you 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.780
 why because with friends they take 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.310
 better and so good the news now to 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.050
 be much more fun than trying 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.820
 someone you do not know and if you are with him 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.320
 they're going to start laughing it's going to be great 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.990
 so nothing guys I recommend it a lot 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.060
 this one just came out to take tier this 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.100
 mini game and the truth is that only the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.750
 book of the grass that you have to stay 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.060
 for jobs that only bother me 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.130
 We'll see a bit here if we see 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.200
 some kind of block that is crooked 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.270
 because I saw how to identify those who 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.370
 they are dry are what they are and what 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.110
 are normal are those that are not like that 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.960
 that I do not think I do anything here 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.680
 that has not been one and saying hahaha 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.680
 the best 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.110
 no, well that's a little trolls and for him 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.520
 it's going to be very funny but I do not 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.289
 realized so we're going to go up here 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.689
 maybe some who were watching 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.769
 as now I'm shut up 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:35.899
 to see and see and it was a little good 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:38.539
 the game let's not say it was the great 

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:39.979
 thing if I'll show you a little 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.529
 server here we have many servers 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.299
 I have no use proto hunter so you 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.679
 I'm going to put the video because I think so 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:47.239
 they look for more people and so for what 

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.099
 see more people and identify a 

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:52.669
 little more and as you can see in the views 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:55.339
 this cute here can touch the 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.349
 people to enter and when they already have 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.719
 all inside and I can not see touch 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.429
 how were two this two blocks alive 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.709
 and we could not find them why 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:06.079
 we take a lot are a block is the 

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:09.769
 they can mess up your team so we're going to 

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:10.399
 try to go through here we go is a mini 

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.589
 Parkour 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.239
 there is one here and on the other side there is one but 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.099
 the same ladies are different colors 

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:18.319
 and that's the only difference they have 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:21.949
 it's not very difficult for now but here 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.569
 it's going to get very complicated and if I fell and 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.889
 it returns us again to see we are going to 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.599
 try again and it ended 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.699
 video to not make it so long and that 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:31.369
 you do not get bored and do not despair 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.259
 and just want the ip and well there they 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:34.550
