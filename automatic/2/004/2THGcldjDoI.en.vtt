00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
hand grinder and will smooth out the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.140 
hand grinder and will smooth out the
edges<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:56.100> give<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.400> finished<00:01:56.580> look<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
edges to give it a finished look and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.580 
edges to give it a finished look and
we'll<00:01:57.450> even<00:01:57.630> put<00:01:57.870> a<00:01:57.900> little<00:01:58.050> spray<00:01:58.290> paint<00:01:58.530> on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
we'll even put a little spray paint on

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.790 
we'll even put a little spray paint on
there<00:01:58.830> just<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> keep<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.270> rusting

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
there just to keep that from rusting

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
with our control arm outs cut off now we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
with our control arm outs cut off now we
can<00:02:04.080> install<00:02:04.409> rough<00:02:04.710> countries<00:02:05.040> beefy

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460

your<00:03:16.160> lower<00:03:16.310> arm<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.880> then<00:03:17.299> of<00:03:17.420> course<00:03:17.500> you

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
your lower arm and then of course you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.900 
your lower arm and then of course you
can<00:03:18.620> install<00:03:18.920> your<00:03:18.980> upper<00:03:19.250> arm<00:03:19.489> after<00:03:19.609> that

our support bracket and we'll tighten

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.289 
our support bracket and we'll tighten
those<00:03:24.320> down<00:03:24.380> on<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.160> frame<00:03:25.370> rail<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:26.180> the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
crossmember and our long arms we'll go

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.390 
crossmember and our long arms we'll go
ahead<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:32.930> tighten<00:03:33.320> down<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.769> Flex<00:03:34.070> joint

ahead and tighten down the Flex joint

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.280 
ahead and tighten down the Flex joint
but<00:03:34.910> we're<00:03:35.030> gonna<00:03:35.120> leave<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.510> axle<00:03:36.019> mounts

but we're gonna leave the axle mounts
loose<00:03:36.560> we're<00:03:36.890> gonna<00:03:36.980> tighten<00:03:37.400> those<00:03:37.489> once<00:03:37.970> we

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
loose we're gonna tighten those once we
