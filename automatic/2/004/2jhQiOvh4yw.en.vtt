00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.690
 hello to all kids here I saw the crack 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.550
 10 and good today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.799
 jump shots and drop shot of call of duty 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.630
 black ops 2 and well let's start with 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.609
 the jump shot is worth jumping 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.439
 while you're shooting, okay then 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.359
 well now we have come here to 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.949
 a wall is worth to see how they are going 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.619
 the bullets directed when we do the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 jump shot is to say when we jump 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.189
 when we try to kill an enemy and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.470
 you see that the bullets go in a straight line 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.809
 up is worth the normal there is no 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 change and good for what we see with 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.530
 the ot jams is quite effective worth 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.969
 I bring examples with assault rifle and its 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.329
 rifle but more or less with all 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.890
 weapons equal and good here you see that the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.329
 bullets go pretty straight in the jump 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.480
 soto now let's try the drop shott 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 and you see the drop shott bullets 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 they distort pretty well they do not go for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.160
 nothing in a straight line and some that are going 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.559
 to the right others to the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.989
 left and then so good that gives 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 think that the jump shot is pretty 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.379
 better than the drop shott because if they 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.570
 you fix to the sides of where it is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.979
 firing the bullets while making the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.420
 drop shott then they go then good if 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.880
 the enemy moves for that side 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 but if not then it will be more difficult 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.439
 kill him and good now with the mmc 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.049
 submachine gun when we do we felt 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.880
 they're also going pretty straight 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.619
 normal then it pretty good 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.119
 in this game in my opinion and good 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.070
 when we do the next one is going to happen 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.440
 practically the same as with the in the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.210
 94 ok they are going to distort quite 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.789
 the bullets and they're going to go sideways 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.649
 so I recommend in this 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.840
 blank game I only recommend jumping 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.090
 since it is more effective the bullets are not 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.460
 distort and if you and if you crouch and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.929
 you lie down as you can appreciate in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.700
 the wall so if the bullets go towards 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.409
 the sides are good and now I'm going to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.200
 leave some examples of jump shots and drop 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.960
 shots that I've done is worth in a game and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 good so that you can see how they are more 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.619
 effective and what more I like it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.090
 you can leave in the comments but I 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.709
 I will give my opinion and I sincerely believe 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.630
 that the jump shot is much better 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:01.020
 this game is worth it because if we talk about 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.670
 modern warfare 3 which is the game that more 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.649
 I played, so to speak, of the bots 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.630
 the drop shott was much better 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.280
 the jump shot but in this game not in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.229
 this game has changed since good in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.609
 modern warfare 3 is crouching if the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.080
 bullets do not distort they go for nothing 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:16.350
 then it will be easier to kill 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.510
 the game honestly when when 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.340
 you jump more chances to kill 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.380
 it depends on where you are not also you have 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 have to count on the unevenness of the map 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 if you are on some stairs and they 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.630
 They are and they jump up as it JCE 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.830
 The first thing that you will give is the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.140
 head then it does not suit you 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 jumping is better to make you chase not 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.970
 removing things from those that more or less 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.070
 they look like they are not going to entertain me 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.210
 with that honestly yes if you are in 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.640
 some stairs that are usually the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.130
 unevenness in the stairs or in some 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 the level of the map, because if they are 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.850
 up do not try to jump since good 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.710
 The first thing they will give is the head 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.180
 then if you do then they will fail 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.230
 enough more bullets and if that starts to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.480
 shoot the foot then there yes that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.280
 I recommend that you jump jce to give them 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190
 you in the head but not that good 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.560
 it's my opinion it's worth here you have the 94 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.060
 and the submachine gun and you can see how it 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.040
 they do the grosos then later it's 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.920
 leave at the hamptons and well then 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.350
 honestly that the jump show as I do not know 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.270
 I have a scoop control always 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.830
 adding in which has two levers 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.300
 behind you have a box and not on my channel 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.150
 the locals by the age of sequence I 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.860
 agreement and good because it is a command in the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.390
 which has the levers behind 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.710
 with a few times and with other highs if 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.840
 you have the default and you have the 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.980
 tactics then with some highs and with the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.020
 another blades is not good for 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.270
 competitive is quite effective since if 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.470
 you play competitively and you can not do the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.570
 bring liangshan and the drop shott 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.000
 sincerely, we have to learn to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.860
 do it since they are very effective and the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.290
 two are necessary for the different 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.610
 situations that you are in a 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.710
 screen in a competitive challenge going 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.060
 slow after you sincerely good 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.410
 I recommend that you prove it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 practice pretty in private and when 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.340
 no longer go out seeing you check online or 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.650
 sincerely do it online in 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.360
 public and you will see how you are going to improve 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.270
 pretty much us against one especially 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.590
 and it's going to be more effective than matrix in the 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.739
 same then I also wanted to clarify that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.239
 to jump more you can put 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.920
 light weight is worth it and if you like more 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.660
 absorption drop shott you can put 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.970
 light weight and with the light weight you go to 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.739
 jump much more than with that with 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.239
 the other than with any other access 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.140
 with any other advantage good valley 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.550
 that has been everything I hope that I have 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.290
 liked to subscribe the favorites 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.250
 comment and until the next kids 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.250
 goodbye
