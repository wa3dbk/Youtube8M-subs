00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello my friends we are here for me 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:16.820
 I will make a simple statement and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.850
 honest that I have some of my students 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 who are very grateful to be able to do 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.690
 in their lives 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.960
 there are those who are not grateful and I 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.990
 I only went a lot with this but I learned that 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.239
 You have to unfold to help. 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.610
 when the person does not want to help himself or 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.949
 when she is helped and willing to go 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.749
 though she was never his student or 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.999
 At least it's never been appreciated what you 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:43.249
 passed on to her and you can not die 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:45.350
 Because of this your life goes on. 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.909
 and so what am I doing nowadays? 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.309
 so nowadays I 'm not going to 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.309
 my students I do what is mine 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.839
 reach and that I do not deny but effective 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.649
 the moment the person shows up 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.149
 ungrateful or that she tells me that 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.190
 prefers to do another kind of thing her 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.379
 is automatically unraveling 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 of my teachings may be that she 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.100
 added no but I will not die for 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 and this is a truth that I speak with 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.329
 you here so much better 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.909
 The floor is the best student I ever had in 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.560
 my life my career because he is 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.329

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.359
 to be free he is a guy who 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.189
 stimulates people in the same way as 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.950
 have to do or do with the heart 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.600
 He enjoys doing and it will help to 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.840
 measure that he can tell me that he does not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.500
 Can they do this and continue his life? 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.439
 He already learned well before me how to 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.689
 deal with the student and the news to 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.920

 really and it's not just the work that 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.450
 involved in the academy talking about 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.680
 inflation but I want to put 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.930

 I was only training here but only for the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.959
 sardine does not but he has some things 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.389

 Okay, thanks, thanks. 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.259
 I hope you like the idea that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.360
 will have another top athlete 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.940

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.240
 by South American I ever knew 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.070
 he would be among the three of the South American 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.620
 how sure am I sure it would be? 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.870
 but finally a little bit of course that does not 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.300
 will commit more than now will enter into 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.060
 everything is competition to add 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.580
 values to his career and that's how I 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.389
 I want you to think that the more 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.180

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.460
 word that is not true but the word 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.940
 truth of each is true of each 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.710

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.169
