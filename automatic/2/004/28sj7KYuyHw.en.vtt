 nation of cake movies I had 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.850

 what time it affects my second form 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 a game just ended immediately 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.719
 only 100 kills can be made 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.100
 it is 9 to 9 which makes it tasty 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.420
 for and emmy's against comma today too 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.460

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.960
 for so doubts on level 2 and also 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.309
 quickly talk about the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 targets fine what I grab naturally so 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.670
 immediately a weapon with the target finder 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 and I just destroy everyone 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.400
 tork finer in black or always real 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.110
 just overpowered know everyone wants 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.220
 everyone is actually bothered 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 the target feyenoord most if you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 blackface what one is just in one 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.869
 porch is the only thing you hear is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.369
 Goddamn how weigh one through one 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 target good goddamn is someone again 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.610
 the Kempen in a corner with the archive 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.229
 target finder is just a kempen 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.939
 decimal by moment you just have one 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.890
 thark fine on my video so put driver 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.420
 sit on your lmg then you can just go 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.110
 back and it is really just the service 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 and tests 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840
 but the moment you go with it 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.369
 Kempen walk it's just see in your PC 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.720
 My use it just as you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.920
 I do think it's sad if you go with it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.820
 walk but i didn't do it 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.049
 laser tag place 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.640
 that was actually the only thing I got 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.750
 about the archive of savages and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 furthermore also quickly about it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.360
 archives of the saying is that a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.770
 little bit because sometimes you can 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.540
 for example , look through curtains 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 with the target of sometimes you get walls 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.720
 Looking back on it anyway so fine as 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 possibly pitch for a while 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.960
 I think so in the next patch 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.700
 but would come if you know how to handle it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 can run bubble then you can just continue 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.850
 look around the wall with the archive 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
 einer such a red piece comes around one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.250
 person does take you throw through the wall 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.110
 is looking a bit like that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.579
 raven ricardo finer but that is that too 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.320
 just fix it quickly here I pick it up 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.969
 on it with f and jean the order of to the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 him there is really productive swaab like you 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.840
 can see I use the targets little 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.979
 ever as a kind of target campers 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.629
 search because there are many campsites 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.500
 in this game play and my target finder 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.940
 helps the f van 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.320
 to get a good score it looks to you here 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.030
 are two people run out off 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.870
 just nice of those red circles around one 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.950
 person one 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.630
 here it is again someone nice the camper 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.010
 the span de fox that there and that day well 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.630
 I'm here and I go to the state directory 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.130
 just a little camper behind that house 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.480
 here were two more kempers after that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.070
 one building actually through and and all sorts 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.450
 other genes are falling off again 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.650
 just a little weird because you think like 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.970
 you walk around in such a game it 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.380
 everyone to know it is that thinks follow 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.550
 me everyone the black or two 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.320
 And you shouldn't think so 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.700
 must always think positive thinking sometimes 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.410
 people just go and then they go for example 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.060
 even 8 sitting in a corner sometimes get up 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.500
 people somewhere else is all rentals 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.880
 are on the folder , which means that they will also be displayed briefly 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.200
 you have to sit at the back and you have to 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.790
 go to play the school you can anyone 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.989
 nice and camper nobody me too 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.820
 actually like doing it because you have to 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.350
 can put your frustration on something like 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820
 your blackface is playing but you have to 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.440
 do not always take on the kempers 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.790
 at the end of this game play or me 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 also a person it they dutch you 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.230
 I have to get out of it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.400
 so yes really hard to a beep camper 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.510
 sit there all the time and he had it 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.190
 about me while just at it 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.690
 walking around was so everyone should 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.590
 actually lost frustration on letters 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.180
 are they doing through 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.709
 everyone to do the core through 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.090
 people sometimes hackers the room with car 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.130
 and while that on the xbox playstation 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.300
 actually not possible 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.560
 we asked for a little cup for that 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.910
 bring warm flag in but it makes 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 no matter I just keep going for a while 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.760
 my coming someone came there was 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.290
 actually meant to be the tips and tricks 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 will teach driver sim black or 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.500
 because black as two is actually made 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 unusual with sir me singles and play around 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.350
 actually play with weapons 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.580
 with which firstly can not Kempen the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.350
 sniper because of course shit a lot 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.360
 fair pay attention or fate or a really me 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.340
 can run hard between the search engines 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.299
 black or two was made for this and so 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.980
 privately there is actually a little bit 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.360
 between esl driver is for long 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.070
 distances and not to really just try 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.540
 it hard to try to run off hard 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.160
 just off to the Russians hoping that you will 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.840
 get a good score but you can 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.250
 the met den ijssel driver with an so 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.750
 drive is playing a bit tactically 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.100
 if you go with a real drive like that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.209
 think to go after playing what quite 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.650
 many people do not do well in black 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.299
 hofstee then you can really just a ps 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.769
 callme and you actually have to 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.060
 just play it quietly with you 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.620
 a little camper has to go with it 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.239
 but not play that you just eat 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.840
 sit in a corner if you are with an so driver 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.340
 is going to play 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.200
 he feels with the already 94 you just have to 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.280
 you have to run nmi camp in nmi 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.989
 can just sit a little bit 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.790
 you have to be a little kempi while 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.989
 you get it in the emmy spans and get it 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.430
 you really just have a really good score with 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.480
 the and so driver I think soon 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.130
 about it is a game play go upload 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.450

 I am playing television now I hear that guy there 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.419

 I am a camper that we are Dutch 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.480

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.040
