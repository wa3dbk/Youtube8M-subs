 of the book where he speaks 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.290
 more than dinosaurs about people who are dedicated to the Chinese

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.520
 where to find these experts etc let's first see a small live 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.250

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.380
 for a certain time 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.870
 to usually do 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.150
 dinosaurs too 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.580
 that to say all 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.510

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.960
 uu as he is very well known 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.510
 four are little 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 they believe little about all sustainability 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.900
 what else do we have here a female doctor a technical booklet with 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.040

 we have here 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.419
 a light pole 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.119

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.049
 the days 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.819
 with everything 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.619
 clear about the obvious 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.399

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.129

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.129
 why this post 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:34.329
 this other pole that the psoe is a map where two radios lived 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.959
 we have here 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.730
 and finally we have a script about what can be mounted 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.389
 was unleashed in which you decide if you are riding 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.179

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.419

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.339
 to that encounter 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.179
 patients who are 16 followed 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.679
 which we have right now must be about 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.740
 18 20 euros 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.960
