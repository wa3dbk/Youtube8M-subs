00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi to all my friends and listeners 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.130
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.250
 born with the joystick today as I had 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.320
 announced in previous episodes vi 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 I will speak in the new few upstream state 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.250
 revealed tonight but with my great 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 surprise will not be really true 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.769
 novelty p's guess what because if 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 now we are going to analyze 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 the image we will notice that the pokémon 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.130
 that I had given two episodes for fake 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.870
 actually it does is precisely the new pokémon 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.850
 just revealed well before commenting 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 and whatever and say that it is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 definitely not evolution 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.670
 the evolution another form of mi.to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.890
 let's read a little what our own 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.010
 hilarious directors of the game 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 freak wrote to make us not understand 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 to what what they produced the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.860
 mystery around pokemon hicks e 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.530
 pokémon ypsilon continues to thicken 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.619
 with the revelation of a pokémon dai 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.360
 vaguely familiar look like her 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.320
 moscow appearance similar to that of the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.130
 powerful pokemon legendary mutu but not 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.960
 identical the new pokémon has many 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 features in common with youtube 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.810
 so the lilac colored body is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.689
 proud and penetrating look you understand 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.049
 in short, this pokemon can be 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.710
 as I told you in the last episode 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.950
 of another form of youtube or 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.790
 we can talk about a new pokémon 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 maybe join then I have to tell you that I 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.369
 on the other form of new you are not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.170
 very much in agreement as you also have 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.720
 said you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.080
 mine is a beautiful pokémon from before 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.509
 generation one of the best perhaps and that 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.270
 therefore it must be preserved and must be done 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.020
 stay with without adding more 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.670
 horrible and obscene forms therefore could 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:20.239
 in my opinion it would be even better than 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 this was a new pokémon maybe 13 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.690
 maybe the pet stamp even though it is now 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.209
 been done by us in the previous ones 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.650
 video games could return to 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.330
 fore creating a new 3 thanks to DNA 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.180
 of new could be a choice 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.209
 a great choice to do this because i 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.549
 reasons are simple at last 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.190
 we will find one of the most loved pokemon 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.890
 that is me youtube 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.350
 or another pokémon of the mutu line 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.590
 and then if you go to read about 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.950
 how many fans wanted this internet 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.109
 pokémon seems to have been waiting for it already 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.970
 from the second generation but it was not 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.920
 was so 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.380
 so why not bring these back 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.609
 ancient desires today in a new game 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.709
 if it could be a winning idea 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.630
 however this with regard to the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.510
 pokémon in fe of which we do not know 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.359
 not even the type but the type seems to me 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.230
 clear that it is also psychic 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:38.250
 because it has very special moves 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.980
 which were shown in a trailer 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.450
 so now I change screen and vi 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.400
 I put that of the moves then in the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.010
 we see the first image in the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.459
 initial screenshot of the battles of 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.850
 pokémon xe pokémon y with his look 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.570
 as our leaflet said here 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.880
 a proud look 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.330
 in the second image it would seem 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.060
 were attacking the opponent with with 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.180
 an energy ball a grass type attack 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.730
 also because they rise all around 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.760
 of the leaves 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.480
 the next move seems to me to be 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.360
 something like a psycho cut seems to me 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.630
 just so be it psycho cut was one 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.000
 perhaps stronger moves than mutuals 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.630
 although still minute was special to me 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.820
 seems like I never remember it's been a while 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.660
 that I don't meet him then I never have it 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.390
 made the case 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.980
 I don't remember if it was so special 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:48.400
 or physical, however, excuse me anyway 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:52.990
 I receive despite not remembering myself 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.350
 I think this is the move 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.670
 however very strong and therefore 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.690
 and above all it is of a psycho type and it comes 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.400
 been given myth in the fourth generation 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.370
 so maybe they can too 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.450
 report to a new pokémon amiu non 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.470
 I believe no no no 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.860
 The next image we find while 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.370
 launches an attack that seems to me 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.950
 be the new special attack now 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.650
 I would not be wrong 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.840
 so I never did it in the episodes 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.870
 let's go immediately to look for you 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.800
 internet to see what is yours 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:43.150
 move stronger because you know guys 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.480
 it is not that I would be wrong in short 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.760
 this episode you fight that you are 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.240
 this 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.200
 boh nobody knows yet 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.610
 however I must say that it seems to me very much 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.220
 clever this new method that 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.050
 they are holy or that of 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.750
 reveal pokémon without saying anything 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.560
 on his past on his future on his 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.640
 here I'm 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.430
 nothing so we are more 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.620
 curious and we must go there to research 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:20.370
 maybe with our thoughts our 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:24.270
 ideas of which type belongs precisely 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.430
 or which moves he can take 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:32.410
 or which evolutionary chain does 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:35.850
 part seems to me a smart move 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.500
 from the gamefreak though 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.430
 anyway after a while you have to give the 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:46.930
 solve these mysteries because anyway 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:49.240
 a fielden despite having been for a long time 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.480
 now revealed we still don't know the 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.000
 like this and less 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.220
 I don't like it because you say anyway 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.660
 ok, a bit of curiosity 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:05.010
 two to three weeks 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.770
 but then it's enough because sincerely after 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.870
 some fans want to know why then 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.970
 curiosity passes after a while 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.770
 and therefore it must be exploited when it is 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:22.770
 full so it seems like a good is a way 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:25.440
 for renzo but to show us a pokémon 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.110
 at a time so they fill 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.070
 More episodes of pokemon smash doing 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:38.390
 also have more listenings to that column 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:41.250
 in short, weekly in Japan and me 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:44.070
 so I greet you because anyway 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.500
 news was so few that not 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.440
 I can do more of this than that 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.310
 that I made this bet in the case 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.580
 there must be news there 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:59.700
 in short, I'll get to in a small 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.170
 part of Friday 's episode of this 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.600
 address book 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:08.690
 therefore I greet you I give appointment to 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.690
 that day and the next
