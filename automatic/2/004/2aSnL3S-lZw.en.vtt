00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:09.220
 hello everyone today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.510
 how to use minecraft of mine 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.100
 very well as you see I have marked a site 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.100
 several sites for three buildings that 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.410
 I'm going to build to do this first 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.110
 let's go unless I'm going to get this out 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.680
 let's go find 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.789
 and we will put floor marking 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.800
 we put this and then 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.350
 we select the area in which we want 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 build for example this 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.829
 let's say it took a little bit just I'm going 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 select to give them a sample 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 and we click right here 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.430
 in any of them and barley line 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 with red now as I have done so that it 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.840
 make as well as a cylinder rectangle 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.390
 each 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.250
 it is simple 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.040
 single 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.680
 take any block and arm as a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.530
 tower so how high do you want that 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.080
 be the building they are going to put a torch 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 and they're going to right click on it like this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.780
 and that's it 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.080
 clicking is going to delineate as a 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.080
 cylinder 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330
 neither 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.800
 I think something is going wrong though 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 how did this form say a hundred 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.270
 quadrilateral and puts him in blocks of 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.190
 any material according to the height that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.980
 want you then put you in 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.980
 torch here and it's going to delineate well 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.100
 now how do I fill this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 and what we are going to do is go to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.340
 publish and put this stuffed 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.630
 we take the combustion engine 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.160
 and a lever 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.440
 we put the filler and any of 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.440
 about torches like this 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.270
 well and everything will turn yellow 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.010
 after that you can remove a block 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.519
 if they want if it bothers them 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.980
 with the combustion engine that is 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:40.340
 steam or redstone and the lever to its 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.340
 side then we take the brick 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.030
 and they pick up any other material that 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.750
 want to fill in, I'm going to choose 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.290
 that is fast wood put here so that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.700
 fill in they have to form a square 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.130
 in 8 bricks here the filling and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.920
 will appear like this if they want it to only 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.410
 form walls and the roof and that the center 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.720
 be empty but if you want everything to be 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.210
 fill add one here and they'll look 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.460
 that this painting is there so it's 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.040
 best 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.200
 and I'm going to take it out for now 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.810
 then the combustion machine 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.800
 you need fuel so we're going to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.319
 put this this yellow dance 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.720
 we click right here 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.080
 and we put it here 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.540
 after this to be used several 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:40.750
 Look at the push to see how to push 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.380
 being pushed several times this goes to 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.830
 be that this blue hairline that they see is going to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.160
 put red and then it will explode to 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.520
 avoid that they will take about three buckets 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.520
 of water 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.810
 or synods right click on the machine the 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.170
 combustion engine and they will add you 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.359
 here in this box and see that they fill 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.310
 and that to be well then to 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.870
 fill with the objects that you 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.650
 they want to select wood 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.780
 I'm going to select 32 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.239
 here where it says filling resources now 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.500
 Jalen levers and start 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.500
 push and it's going to start filling 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.139
 as you see is building 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.139
 automatically so you do it 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.010
 you can put here in filled in the 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.280
 resources any material that you 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.850
 wish they can be wool crystals what 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.980
 you who are scared let's look 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.320
 above and they will see that the center does not 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.970
 it fills up 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.970
 but this fact has already 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.870
 after doing this stuffing 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.570
 is going to give you an indication 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.639
 of a red light that means that already 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.949
 finished building 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.629
 or that the materials have already finished 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.020
 of that you can turn off you can destroy 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.020
 this 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.089
 and this part is already 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.089
 well i will do 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.680
 very well and those who have this mode 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.140
 kraft debut and already know how to build it well 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.280
 that I just did this tutorial for how 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:39.070
 use the stuffing 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.070
 now if you want to use to see 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.130
 these pipes are used to 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.130
 transport objects 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.560
 you can lesson anyone to our 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.300
 extreme 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.980
 to select the pipes of 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.630
 transport that says I had the endless 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:06.330
 no transport pipe 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:11.820
 can select in the air in the area 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:16.590
 and from there for japan in a chest here they put 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:19.080
 This gate of DNA here is going to put 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.550
 the chest is placed they will transport 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.650
 the objects 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.880
 and that we're leaving and that's all thanks 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.880
