bundle for about 2,000 microsoft points

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.859 
bundle for about 2,000 microsoft points
would<00:00:25.949> live<00:00:26.400> lates<00:00:26.670> up<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.300> twenty<00:00:27.689> five

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
would live lates up to about twenty five

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.640 
would live lates up to about twenty five
dollars<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.539> buy<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> each

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
dollars or it can you can buy the each

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370 
dollars or it can you can buy the each
one<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.309> around<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.110> 800<00:00:34.110> microsoft

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
one for around I think 800 microsoft

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.290 
one for around I think 800 microsoft
points<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.280> better<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> buying<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> bundle

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
points so it's better to buying a bundle

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.290 
points so it's better to buying a bundle
and<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> steal

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and it's a really it's actually a steal

and it's a really it's actually a steal
for<00:00:39.329> how<00:00:39.840> much<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.320> put<00:00:40.590> into<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.950> starting

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
for how much they put into this starting

many markers as possible oh no it's not

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.789 
many markers as possible oh no it's not
very<00:01:21.090> clear<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.930> basically<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.770> are

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
very clear to me but basically there are

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469 
very clear to me but basically there are
these<00:01:22.979> signs<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> number<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.210> if

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
these signs they have a number on it if

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
these signs they have a number on it if
you<00:01:24.600> smash<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> sign<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.830> number<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.400> on

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you smash the sign the number that's on

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.100 
you smash the sign the number that's on
it<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> amount<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> points<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.840> get

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it is the amount of points that you get

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.899 
it is the amount of points that you get
you<00:01:28.409> need<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.890> enough<00:01:29.100> points<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.670> get

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you need to get enough points to get

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.190 
you need to get enough points to get
either<00:01:30.090> bronze<00:01:30.540> silver<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.049> gold<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:32.130> much

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
either bronze silver or gold just much

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
either bronze silver or gold just much
simpler<00:01:34.200> terminology<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
simpler terminology right there for you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.690 
simpler terminology right there for you
guys<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.049> um<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.159> winning<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
guys and if you um the winning of the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.140 
guys and if you um the winning of the
drift<00:01:39.210> attack<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.670> jump<00:01:41.670> nitrous

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
drift attack will get you jump nitrous

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
drift attack will get you jump nitrous
which<00:01:42.390> gives<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.810> extra<00:01:43.229> speed<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> air

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
which gives you extra speed in the air

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.639 
which gives you extra speed in the air
so<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:45.030> actually<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.509> jump<00:01:45.869> longer<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
so you can actually like jump longer and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
so you can actually like jump longer and
getting<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> jump<00:01:48.060> nitrous<00:01:48.390> Pro<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
getting a jump nitrous Pro will get you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.270 
getting a jump nitrous Pro will get you
like

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
like

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.109 
like
smoke<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.740> nitrous<00:01:52.740> being<00:01:53.010> used<00:01:53.280> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
smoke of the nitrous being used is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.800 
smoke of the nitrous being used is
different<00:01:54.960> colors<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.820> winning<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
different colors and then the winning of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.240 
different colors and then the winning of
snacks<00:01:58.790> yes<00:01:59.790> smash-and-grab<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:01.009> drift<00:02:02.009> tires

snacks yes smash-and-grab is drift tires

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.109 
snacks yes smash-and-grab is drift tires
which<00:02:03.060> allow<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.650> longer<00:02:05.520> drifts

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
which allow you to do longer drifts

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
which allow you to do longer drifts
which<00:02:06.300> are<00:02:06.479> basically<00:02:06.690> essential<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.830> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
which are basically essential to do the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.210 
which are basically essential to do the
drift<00:02:08.700> attack<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> would<00:02:09.539> suggest<00:02:09.690> doing

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
drift attack so I would suggest doing

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.979 
drift attack so I would suggest doing
this<00:02:11.220> smash<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.910> grab<00:02:12.060> before<00:02:12.270> drift<00:02:12.720> attack

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
this smash and grab before drift attack

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.830 
this smash and grab before drift attack
so<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.410> get<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> drift<00:02:14.100> tires<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.660> then

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so you can get the drift tires and then

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.979 
so you can get the drift tires and then
drift<00:02:16.350> ours<00:02:16.560> pro<00:02:16.860> gets<00:02:17.750> colored<00:02:18.750> smoke

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
drift ours pro gets colored smoke

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.500 
drift ours pro gets colored smoke
