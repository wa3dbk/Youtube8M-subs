00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hello people to my first recording 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.200
 from the moneymaker tutorial yes what would 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 I explain today I declare today 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.420
 Actually only the basic knowledge how to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.400
 that's just how it works 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
 unspectacular of all becomes now 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.510
 quasi I explained would actually 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.830
 just explain it all up here today 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.810
 and let's get to new 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.660
 We can do animation with new animation 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.450
 Of course, create a new animation 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.969
 So we would have a new animation 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.440
 create 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.140
 Of course we can do that with open animation 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.969
 open an animation I take and though 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.969
 one here mach ma 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.970
 oh so 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.370
 the where he invites the world just recently 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.700
 quotes 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.049
 create 3d model just look what 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.920
 now comes out at because we already 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.049
 I just saw one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 error message because I just got a file 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.270
 deleted has just now needed 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 but it would have happened so now we have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.890
 here an animation Also charged 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890
 very chic 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 otherwise we took up here safe yet 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.979
 We can do that with animations 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.789
 of course save our animations 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.070
 because safe animation from then we can 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.630
 the current animation again under 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.350
 save another name 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 I think there must be something if we 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.750
 that want to fulfill now 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.539
 then he has the file here now 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.750
 created and here is our animation 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.299
 also in there for exporters movie 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.149
 we can do that as a movie 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.959
 but I would have to export one 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.179
 other times because exporters screen that is 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:12.080
 if we click on it click here 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.080
 save the arm 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 continue 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.150
 to save 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.160
 then he saves us the current one 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 screen and opens up already 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.940
 always pumped in quickly 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.320
 I can not possibly show that and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.870
 Wore it well that we get that 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.570
 automatically opens so have now in 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:40.680
 beautiful screen we have the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:43.750
 nest press portals then we have here 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.640
 open project full of this is the folder 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.340
 where all our files are in is too 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.739
 the picture in there 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.450
 Here we have import animations here 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.590
 can we have another animation 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.989
 to pick up with 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.560
 I take here will reilly 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.560
 some overlapping had happened 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.780
 No eight days no feedback now 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.790
 I have an animation below 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.760
 and oh yes the island we have now 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:22.000
 here still with trainer-son which also 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.000
 here 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.390
 then we have yet here 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.990
 shown because here we can ours 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.300
 of course, play animations and here 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.350
 if the animation should be repeated 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.360
 I can show that too shortly 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.610
 builds that she sees her speed 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.330
 I'm still cool, I mean 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:54.520
 that's how long it takes here 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.730
 and now he's catching her all over again 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.989
 because we have just done that 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.480
 because camera timeline that's around the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.560
 to adjust the camera angle 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.660
 that also explains the other times 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.510
 that's what I explain if we do 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.980
 to create the first animations 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.660
 yes undo it i thought second 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.010
 that would have to be reversed enough 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.690
 up here and when are ours gone 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.210
 I still believe that island can still do that 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.170
 But we do not put 1 back like that now 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.100
 for sure 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.610
 to restore the closeness is female then 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.200
 here are the settings help 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.960
 Show or not if we have that now 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.230
 you are wearing it down here 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.490
 the help would be the make you see 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.490
 we down here no more 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.050
 the recorder why that is because of the 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.480
 server not I always have that on the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.650
 default settings or me is there 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.080
 yet no difference noticed 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.790
 I put this around then we have 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.890
 still the interface koller 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.610
 so we can change the color of that 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.400
 set the interface here 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.780
 I do not want very nice disgusting green 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.440
 lies on this is me now again 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.010
 too dark 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.860
 but that's how we look 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.650
 then porsche dÃ¶ring that is soft 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.900
 lighting or not I always have that 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.320
 because that means soft 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.840
 lighting sochaux framerate now 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.490
 you'll see us up here now 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.409
 framerate no longer appears and now 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.789
 framerate 93 percent 6 1 percent 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:35.279
 Write a bit through recording 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:37.009
 so texture interpolation yes that brings 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:39.239
 that the lyrics are a bit like that 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.909
 so blurred is pretty much one 

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:44.129
 a bit but what you need it for 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.080
 i have no idea i can 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.199
 Imagine that the frame rate at 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.019
 This does not make bad pcs that fast 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:56.009
 the breaks are over, but it looks good 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:59.069
 really nice shit off that too 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.800
 say on the hit back face is so now 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:05.249
 you see the grass here if 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.619
 I put it out now you can see that 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.719
 saw that it was behind the grass is 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:12.800
 you can see that at the door as well 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.800
 not available is very nice 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:21.659
 yes, at the moment that shows what is behind 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.159
 an object is now even that 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.510
 What you do not actually see 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:29.210
 now you can not see it anymore 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.620
 so then we have the size here 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.340
 Here we can be the biggest in the world 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.340
 to adjust 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:42.280
 I want to get as big as it gets 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.440
 not quite as tall as 256 and then 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.349
 jerky with me properly 16 rp 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.520
 It is not that much we are now 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:55.240
 that back down so that fits 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.979
 and yet the quality here we can 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.410
 set the quality as ours 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:03.130
 animations because if they are 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.380
 Finished is always on high 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.220
 simply best 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.199
 otherwise you can still down here 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.900
 look at performance when you're big 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.669
 framerate slumps and when I go to 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.780
 example here we are shown 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:19.479
 have changed the size of the mep 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.720
 because you can see the framerate here 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:23.620
 went pretty high and then directly 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.030
 taken down again 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.500
 then she has normalized again 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.840
 and then explains briefly how to do it 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.990
 moving here and that is quite 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.240
 just you just hold the right one 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.960
 pressed mouse button then you can 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:46.349
 look around and with via sd you can 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.349
 because you move normally here 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.580
 or you just press the left one 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.280
 mouse button with it you can then also 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.450
 still look around 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.690
 I always do everything with the 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:03.250
 right is most comfortable so otherwise 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:07.360
 Was that the tutorial now? 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.360
 See you next time
