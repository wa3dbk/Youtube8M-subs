00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.740 
it looks a little more polished a little
more<00:01:48.960> refined<00:01:49.549> maybe<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.909> little<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.509> home

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
more refined maybe a little more at home

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.380 
more refined maybe a little more at home

don't we take a quick tour of the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.929 
don't we take a quick tour of the
machine<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.460> where<00:01:59.640> everything

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
machine so we can see where everything

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
machine so we can see where everything
is<00:02:00.060> located<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> bottom<00:02:02.159> right

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
is located here in the bottom right

corner is the power switch you'll notice

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859 
corner is the power switch you'll notice
if<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.250> familiar<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> M<00:02:05.939> 200<00:02:06.540> there

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
if you're familiar with the M 200 there

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.080 
if you're familiar with the M 200 there
is<00:02:07.020> no<00:02:07.259> lock<00:02:07.860> switch<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.580> way<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:08.910> on

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
is no lock switch the way there was on

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
is no lock switch the way there was on
that<00:02:09.209> machine<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.319> M<00:02:10.440> 200<00:02:10.890> had<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> little

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that machine the M 200 had a little

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.410 
that machine the M 200 had a little
slider<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.940> keep<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
slider to keep you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.360 
slider to keep you
accidentally<00:02:12.959> turning<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.349> off<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> never

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
accidentally turning it off but I never

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
accidentally turning it off but I never
did<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.750> probably<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.470> well

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
did and so it's probably just as well

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
did and so it's probably just as well
they<00:02:16.800> got<00:02:16.950> rid<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.060> little<00:02:18.120> north

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390

if you lost your your primary pen but
that's<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.190> little<00:05:38.340> inconvenient<00:05:38.730> if<00:05:38.970> you're

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
that's a little inconvenient if you're

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.180 
that's a little inconvenient if you're
running<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.540> machine<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.170> you<00:05:40.890> don't<00:05:41.040> want

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
this machine they've actually put the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.030 
this machine they've actually put the
emergency<00:05:48.240> pen<00:05:48.750> slot<00:05:49.080> right<00:05:49.290> here<00:05:49.680> on<00:05:49.830> the

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
emergency pen slot right here on the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.040 
emergency pen slot right here on the
front<00:05:50.280> edge<00:05:50.430> behind<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.270> little<00:05:51.360> door<00:05:51.600> so<00:05:51.870> if<00:05:51.960> I

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
front edge behind a little door so if I

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.700 
front edge behind a little door so if I
can<00:05:52.230> get<00:05:52.560> this<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.800> slide<00:05:53.250> open<00:05:53.400> for<00:05:53.820> me<00:05:54.710> which

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
can get this to slide open for me which

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.140 
can get this to slide open for me which
would<00:05:55.950> probably<00:05:56.100> be<00:05:56.340> easier<00:05:56.670> if<00:05:56.790> I<00:05:56.880> wasn't

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
would probably be easier if I wasn't

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.140 
would probably be easier if I wasn't
holding<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.480> camera<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:59.460> unsnap<00:05:59.910> it

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
holding that camera you just unsnap it

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.430 
holding that camera you just unsnap it
like<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:00.690> there<00:06:00.870> is<00:06:00.900> your<00:06:01.140> emergency

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
like that and there is your emergency

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.830 
like that and there is your emergency
stylus<00:06:02.160> this<00:06:02.880> did<00:06:03.090> not<00:06:03.240> actually<00:06:03.390> come<00:06:03.600> with

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
stylus this did not actually come with

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.170 
stylus this did not actually come with
the<00:06:04.170> machine<00:06:04.440> by<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.650> way<00:06:04.860> but<00:06:05.670> I<00:06:05.700> had<00:06:05.970> one

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
the machine by the way but I had one

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.680 
the machine by the way but I had one
from<00:06:06.510> my<00:06:06.900> m200<00:06:07.650> days<00:06:07.830> that<00:06:08.730> turns<00:06:09.330> out<00:06:09.480> to<00:06:09.510> be

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
from my m200 days that turns out to be

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.730 
from my m200 days that turns out to be
the<00:06:09.780> exact<00:06:10.080> same<00:06:10.110> size<00:06:10.500> which<00:06:10.980> is<00:06:11.130> nice<00:06:12.740> and

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
the exact same size which is nice and

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.440 
the exact same size which is nice and
here<00:06:13.920> we<00:06:14.010> have<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.280> keyboard<00:06:14.460> which<00:06:15.150> if

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
here we have the keyboard which if

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.060 
here we have the keyboard which if
you're<00:06:15.660> familiar<00:06:15.840> with<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.410> keyboard<00:06:16.770> for

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
you're familiar with the keyboard for

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
you're familiar with the keyboard for
the<00:06:17.930> m200<00:06:19.190> tablet<00:06:20.190> will<00:06:20.310> be<00:06:20.430> very<00:06:20.730> familiar

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
the m200 tablet will be very familiar

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.820 
the m200 tablet will be very familiar
too<00:06:21.450> because<00:06:21.780> as<00:06:21.900> you<00:06:22.110> can<00:06:22.260> see<00:06:22.440> here<00:06:22.650> it's

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
too because as you can see here it's

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.390 
too because as you can see here it's
pretty<00:06:23.640> much<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.270> exact<00:06:24.570> same<00:06:24.720> layout<00:06:25.400> there

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
pretty much the exact same layout there

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.830 
pretty much the exact same layout there
are<00:06:26.460> a<00:06:26.490> lot<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.640> thoughtful<00:06:27.000> little<00:06:27.300> touches

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
are a lot of thoughtful little touches

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.750 
are a lot of thoughtful little touches
to<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.080> way<00:06:28.170> the<00:06:28.320> m400<00:06:28.920> works<00:06:29.130> that<00:06:29.430> I<00:06:29.460> really

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
to the way the m400 works that I really

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.240 
to the way the m400 works that I really
appreciate<00:06:30.240> an<00:06:30.990> example<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.560> that<00:06:31.710> is<00:06:31.890> the<00:06:32.100> way

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
appreciate an example of that is the way

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.670 
appreciate an example of that is the way
the<00:06:32.550> screen<00:06:32.910> orientation<00:06:33.090> works<00:06:33.780> when<00:06:34.590> you

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
the screen orientation works when you

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.070 
the screen orientation works when you
open<00:06:35.010> the<00:06:35.130> machine<00:06:35.460> into<00:06:35.669> laptop<00:06:36.600> mode<00:06:36.840> like

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
open the machine into laptop mode like

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.879 
open the machine into laptop mode like
this<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.890> screen<00:06:38.190> automatically

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
this the screen automatically

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.950 
this the screen automatically
Orient's<00:06:39.340> into<00:06:40.210> the<00:06:40.389> direction<00:06:40.599> that<00:06:40.870> you

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
Orient's into the direction that you

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.989 
Orient's into the direction that you
would<00:06:41.020> expect<00:06:41.409> it<00:06:41.530> to<00:06:41.560> go<00:06:41.740> when<00:06:42.490> you<00:06:42.610> flip<00:06:42.909> it

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:42.999 
would expect it to go when you flip it

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:46.200 
would expect it to go when you flip it
back<00:06:43.240> turn<00:06:44.050> it<00:06:44.139> back<00:06:44.259> into<00:06:44.469> a<00:06:44.590> tablet<00:06:45.210> the

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
back turn it back into a tablet the

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.659 
back turn it back into a tablet the
screen<00:06:46.569> automatically<00:06:47.289> reorients<00:06:48.039> into

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
screen automatically reorients into

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.519 
screen automatically reorients into
portrait<00:06:49.210> mode<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.810> other<00:06:49.930> thing<00:06:50.169> though<00:06:50.319> is

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529 
portrait mode the other thing though is

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.409 
portrait mode the other thing though is
there's<00:06:50.830> this<00:06:51.039> screen<00:06:51.580> orientation<00:06:51.729> button

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
there's this screen orientation button

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.629 
there's this screen orientation button
and<00:06:52.689> what<00:06:53.439> it<00:06:53.529> does<00:06:53.710> is<00:06:53.979> it<00:06:54.129> works<00:06:54.279> with<00:06:54.520> an

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
and what it does is it works with an

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.390 
and what it does is it works with an
internal<00:06:54.969> sensor<00:06:55.449> so<00:06:55.960> what<00:06:56.469> you<00:06:56.590> do<00:06:56.740> is<00:06:57.009> you

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
internal sensor so what you do is you

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.860 
internal sensor so what you do is you
orient<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:58.240> screen<00:06:58.569> into<00:07:00.539> your<00:07:01.539> aunt<00:07:01.749> the

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
orient the screen into your aunt the

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.350 
orient the screen into your aunt the
screen<00:07:02.110> so<00:07:02.349> that<00:07:02.379> down<00:07:02.860> is<00:07:03.310> in<00:07:03.909> the<00:07:04.240> direction

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
screen so that down is in the direction

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.179 
screen so that down is in the direction
that<00:07:04.810> you<00:07:04.930> want<00:07:05.050> to<00:07:05.229> be<00:07:05.319> down<00:07:05.529> and<00:07:05.830> then<00:07:06.129> you

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:06.189 
that you want to be down and then you

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:07.920 
that you want to be down and then you
just<00:07:06.340> push<00:07:06.520> the<00:07:06.639> button<00:07:06.669> and<00:07:07.029> it<00:07:07.840> will

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
just push the button and it will

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.830 
just push the button and it will
automatically<00:07:08.620> rotate<00:07:08.979> the<00:07:09.340> screen<00:07:09.810> so<00:07:10.810> that

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
automatically rotate the screen so that

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.019 
automatically rotate the screen so that
down<00:07:11.139> is<00:07:11.379> down<00:07:13.740> which<00:07:14.740> is<00:07:14.889> pretty<00:07:15.159> nice<00:07:15.279> here's
