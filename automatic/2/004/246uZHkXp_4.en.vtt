all the way up when you get to a corner
there's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> certain<00:01:20.640> sequence<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.240> makes<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there's a certain sequence it makes it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.940 
there's a certain sequence it makes it
really<00:01:21.750> smooth<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> clean<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.950> once

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
really smooth and clean and that is once

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.170 
really smooth and clean and that is once
you<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:26.909> second<00:01:27.450> step<00:01:28.490> move<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.700> axe

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.450 

get<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> duck<00:01:33.810> foot<00:01:34.110> position

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
get into a duck foot position

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.790 
get into a duck foot position
now<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> match<00:01:36.480> my<00:01:36.510> hands<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.410> AK<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.770> I

now I match my hands on the AK so I

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.960 
now I match my hands on the AK so I
never<00:01:38.010> let<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
never let go of it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.530 
never let go of it
turn<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.080> new<00:01:40.230> direction<00:01:41.330> plant<00:01:42.330> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
turn it into the new direction plant it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.710 
turn it into the new direction plant it
and<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.220> again<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:49.800> once<00:01:50.130> again<00:01:50.720> duck

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and I'm off again so once again duck

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.140 
can beat straight up it then it doesn't
matter<00:02:10.050> which<00:02:10.350> mean<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.649> put<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> action<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
matter which mean you put the action and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.240 
matter which mean you put the action and
snow<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.690> soft<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.230> use<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> below<00:02:13.920> grip

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
snow this soft that use the below grip

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.100 
snow this soft that use the below grip
and<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.120> gives<00:02:15.330> me<00:02:15.390> my<00:02:15.450> security

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and that's what gives me my security

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.500 
and that's what gives me my security
because<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.280> punch<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.240> fall<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
because I can punch that in if I fall I

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.990 
because I can punch that in if I fall I
can<00:02:18.810> hang<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:20.640> snow<00:02:20.820> were<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
can hang on to that if this snow were a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.330 
can hang on to that if this snow were a
lot<00:02:21.240> harder<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.900> couldn't<00:02:22.620> penetrate<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
lot harder I couldn't penetrate to the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.910 
lot harder I couldn't penetrate to the
spike<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> snow<00:02:24.450> then<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.410> would<00:02:25.590> keep<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
spike in the snow then I would keep the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.510 
spike in the snow then I would keep the
same<00:02:26.100> grip<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:26.760> use<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.959> pit<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.340> way

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
same grip but use the pit and that way

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.280 
same grip but use the pit and that way
so<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.000> you're<00:02:30.150> booting<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.660> Street<00:02:30.900> steep

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
so if you're booting up a Street steep

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.490 
so if you're booting up a Street steep
to<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:33.270> gives<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.600> great<00:02:33.780> security<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
to are it gives you great security that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
to are it gives you great security that
way<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.370> may<00:02:35.490> switch<00:02:35.880> back<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.209> forth

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
way and you may switch back and forth

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.090 
way and you may switch back and forth
depending<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> smooth<00:02:37.680> building

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
depending on with the smooth building

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.310 
depending on with the smooth building
you<00:02:38.160> find<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.490> soft<00:02:38.730> spot<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.900> plunge<00:02:40.140> it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
you find a soft spot you can plunge it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.050 
you find a soft spot you can plunge it
in<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:40.800> hard<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.850> get

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
in if it's hard like this we can get

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.440 
in if it's hard like this we can get
through<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:43.350> use<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.709> pit<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.239> both<00:02:45.239> those

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
through then use the pit so both those

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.430 
through then use the pit so both those
are<00:02:45.780> still<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.260> shuffle<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.190> it
