00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.325
 Hi everybody 

00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:02.301
 My name is Tyler Oakley 

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.723
 and i'm chilling here 

00:00:03.723 --> 00:00:05.592
 I'm a simple jam man 

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:07.342
 (laugh) 

00:00:07.342 --> 00:00:09.435
 and we know who is today. 

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.595
 It is my special guest, my good friend 

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.683
 the one and only, Mamrie Shart 

00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:15.719
 hey guys 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.223
 (laugh) 

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:19.011
 we just accidentally drunk a wine bottle 

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:20.636
 so here we are 

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:22.266
 Mametown and we had to put on costumes 

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.362
 it just feels good 

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.110
 And I thought look, look 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.883
 there is nothing 

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:27.101
 (laughs) look, look, look 

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.762
 look, nothing that I like to have on my chest 

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.631
 then some creamy nuts 

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.704
 OK (laughs) 

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.268
 you're so fond of: and I'm gone 

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.764
 it is not a time ray video without it 

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:38.389
 It's possible! 

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.563
 what? (laughs) 

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:41.376
 I wanted to say, it's not 

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:42.615
 our ship, our ship 

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:43.794
 (Tyler laughs) 

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:44.627
 I'm still sailing 

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.679
 I'm the only one on that whole thing 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.101
 it can happen! 

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:49.787
 in addition to having a video without a suit 

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:51.859
 or a drink, it turns out 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.649
 what were we before? children 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.065
 a few children (laughs) 

00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:56.899
 innocent 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.137
 wait, be more specific 

00:00:58.137 --> 00:00:59.113
 why do we wear sunglasses? 

00:00:59.113 --> 00:00:59.864
 we look crazy 

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.627
 I ... have to stop them 

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:03.684
 we can communicate with the public 

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:05.025
 if we wear sunglasses? 

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:06.061
 What do you mean- 

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.215
 Look, I want to make sure I reach you people 

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:09.312
 you will peaches 

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:10.246
 you will achieve 

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:11.526
 you are my peach 

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.335
 you will reach if you are lucky 

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:14.371
 Mamrie, what? 

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.671
 Children are watching 

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:16.586
 Sorry 

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.882
 (Laugh) 

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.121
 so, the children at home 

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.157
 need the story 

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:22.396
 and I think, who are better 

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.509
 in telling people 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.728
 that peanut butter and jam 

00:01:25.728 --> 00:01:27.963
 Holy shit !! 

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:29.426
 before you put your body in a sandwich 

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.112
 listen to this sandwich 

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:32.352
 Shall we kiss? 

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:33.266
 -OK 

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.729
 yes, we think that's your little ones 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.760
 having to learn from a good source 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.484
 not from your old geriatric parents 

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:40.906
 but we must talk like youth 

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:41.739
 (laughs) 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.010
 Fo shizzle, fo shizzle (farmer) 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.037
 ok, so we asked you to tweet your questions to us 

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:49.231
 with the hashtag, what was the hashtag? 

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:49.882
 Flowers and the bees 

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:50.877
 Flowers and the bees 

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:51.771
 because, you know what 

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:56.647
 I think education is the key to 

00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:59.641
 preventing unfortunate moments 

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.962
 ok, so Julie wants to know, 

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:02.546
 I haven't had my first kiss yet 

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.964
 and I am very nervous about getting him 

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:08.560
 tips for sensually overcoming your fear of touching lips 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.450
 everything is made from small atoms 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.421
 things your lips are made of 

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.174
 your lips 

00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:15.392
 are the same things of which 

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:17.180
 traffic pawns are made 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.602
 how do you prevent an STD? 

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:19.314

00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:31.606
 and damn genital warts 

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.779

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:40.382
 wait a second 

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:41.580
 do not 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.466
 see a condom as a poncho 

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:46.954

00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:53.406
 don't risk it, pack your biscuit 

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.072
 At the end of the day 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.571
 when I touch something 

00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.257
 what has been his garbage in someone else 

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:00.537
 I put on a glove 

00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:01.268
 Do you understand what I mean 

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:02.631
 -amen.- so what you have to do is 

00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:04.319
 Tyler plays the role of a dick 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.025
 he does that for the greater part of his life 

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:07.021
 (Tyler laughs) 

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:08.565
 when you get a condom, it is 

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:09.581
 Oh my God 

00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:10.556
 is it rolled up 

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:11.612
 OK 

00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:14.985
 you might see a little thing sticking up 

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:16.021
 such as a small dooly doo 

00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:17.260
 like a little thing on the top 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.479
 a small hole to catch things 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.369
 and roll [Tyler] Oh my ... 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:22.194

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:32.131

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.126

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.117
 Now we have been told how to put a condom on 

00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:37.514

 Stefan has put himself in the love cave 

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:43.121
 I guess you don't have to worry about that 

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.970
 if that's how you describe sex 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.230
 (laughs) Jesus Christ 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.180
 When you are too agreeing 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.277
 keep that thought 

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:50.070
 I don't think you are 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.289

 hop to the left, go busy 

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:07.192
 but you better hop out 

00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:08.594
 if you feel dizzy 

00:04:08.594 --> 00:04:09.630
 if you are drunk 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.869
 -honest-- - or you can feel that 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.901
 this is not something you want 

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:13.815
 if you think something is wrong 

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:15.217
 get out of there like lightning 

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:18.183
 just remove yourself from the situation 

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.463
 and don't deal with that person 

00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:20.479
 he should know better 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.145
 if they make you dizzy 

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:23.633

00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:25.416

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:31.085
 I think so 

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:32.487
 sex is great 

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:34.986
 if you are 100% ready 

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:38.683
