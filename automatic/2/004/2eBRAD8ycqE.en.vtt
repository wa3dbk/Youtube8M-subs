00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
 Tell me, what are you talking about? 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.799
 passing here for you an easy way 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.429
 to convert binary numbers to this 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.590
 bad 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.599
 this way that's how I go 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.080
 show you the table is used 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.600
 sure your test usually starts 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.949
 your course you will have common subjects 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.710
 all the courses you will need 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 to do this conversion would end and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 really a teacher who teaches you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 The most complicated way then to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 help you here in which I went through 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160
 this and did not like it because I learned the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.290
 more complicated and only after 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 learn easier or is passing 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.550
 for you here that way that is well 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
 easy for you is understanding how 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.969
 does this conversion of the millionaire number 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.700
 to the decimal number 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.289
 so let's go to the first one 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.180
 binary conversion 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.430
 you may notice that you have a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.280
 sequence of eight number one because 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 binary represented by eight right bits 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.489
 and in this case you have 8 bits filled 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 the result of this evil that you are 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.299
 doing table where you can perceive 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:33.329
 which is divided by eight columns right and 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:34.970
 14 32 and 16 184 2 255 has this first 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.299
 number 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:44.159
 You 'll get it. You'll fill it all. 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.080
 the columns with the number 16 to 1ª 2ª 3ª 4ª 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.460
 5th 6th 7th 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:55.320
 and 8th what you will do you will add 128 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.990
 plus 64 plus 32 + 16 + 18 + 4 plus two 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 and one that in the end you get to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.570
 result of 255 then you realize that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.750
 if you have all the columns 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.380
 completed 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.600
 you get the number 285 result 255 right 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.030
 that the final result of the conversion 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.480
 when you have all 8 bits 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.180
 fulfilled because this here for you is 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.010
 o A binary is composed of 8 bits 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.760
 So you have to I created the eight 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.990
 columns as the number 1 fish I have 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.720
 eight bits 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.120
 now let's convert this second 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.240
 number that second to mine for that evil 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.330
 then the first with 10 to the second 10 to 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.980
 third with 10 to fourth placed in a 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:49.620
 car 16 04 02 you put one and you 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:03:00.360
 will put a do the calculation 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:03.660
 16 29 came to a decimal number 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.950
 about the binary we have here in 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.350
 columbia the binaries 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.950
 So this number here that you are 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.750
 seeing they misled, he is represented 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.160
 by number 19 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.459
 Now let's move on to this next one. 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.500
 number this next number you follow the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.500
 same logic as before 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.709
 we have here the 1st of the first column 128 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.130
 you will fill in will add a 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.390
 of 6432 you can see here that the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.090
 remaining you will fill 10 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.340
 that ended up have me fill 10 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.800
 so I just need to complete the three 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.380
 first columns and these will be 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.540
 first columns that I will make the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:53.470
 then adds the 128 plus 64 plus 32 128 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:59.920
 plus 64 point that gives 128 38 and 40 and 88 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:06.660
 61 888 188 189 90 then you have 1 192 with 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:12.370
 plus 32 center 2232 between 92 and 93 64 204 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.130
 214 224 you have reached 224 result 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.720
 the conversion of this number to 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.200
 From this evil of you came the results in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.220
 four that 204 which is the result in 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.440
 of this evil 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.750
 so you can see that using the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.570
 table is an easy thing so let's go 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.730
 do two more exercises to get there 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.320
 to the end that I believe that with this 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.870
 demonstration everyone is getting 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.410
 convert the binary numbers to that of 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.250
 bad 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.940
 so come on, that number is 11 11 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.229
 00 00 in decimal would look like the result 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.380
 Let's fill in the tables. 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.800
 the first column with the second with the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.220
 third with and fourth with and the other 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.700
 5th 6th 7th and 8th you will fill 10 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:04.000
 you will make the sum of 128 with 64 with 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:06.820
 32 and 16 at the time of the test because you 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 can use the calculator is doing in 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.560
 paper and that nervousness begins to 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.580
 You can not get past that 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.030
 status of 128 plus 64 3216 you finish 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.160
 wandering 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.120
 so I'll give you a certainty if 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.450
 you have column 128 as well and column 64 and 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.729
 16 in china and only 84 2 to 1 and not 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.760
 it is fulfilled that you will do 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.550
 You will come here to add 8 + 4 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.740
 result of 12 plus two result 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.919
 of 14 with one more 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.289
 15 then what happens is that the 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.550
 sum of all communes reaches 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.650
 235 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.720
 so if you have only four last 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.039
 columns with the filled in number zero 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.669
 you will get 255 and subtract 15 that you 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.919
 will reach the result of 240 then 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.949
 you realized that this trick is zinho 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.259
 easy easy to remember proof only you 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:07.900
 Remember this, let's go to the last one. 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:11.020
 11th floor 11 00 11 00 in first column 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:15.810
 with the second with the third with 10 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:20.530
 fourth 10 to fifth with basket with 1 to 0 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:27.880
 result that we are getting more 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:29.620
 64 128 38 and 48 58 188 178 188 with more 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.610
 two with four more né 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.370
 you will reach the 192 with 8 more you 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:41.919
 will arrive or 200 with four more you 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:45.849
 will reach 204 then 128 plus 64 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:48.789
 people how much it is in 121 61 of the 180 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:54.639
 with eight more of the 108 plus four 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:58.389
 of 192 192 with 8 more you reach 200 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:02.259
 with four more you get to 204 then 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:04.539
 this is the conversion of torque to this 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:07.090
 that through this table it becomes 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:09.130
 a very simple very simple thing 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.259
 even and I'm sure that all of you 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.560
 they will be able to get it right at the time of the race 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:18.160
 and I urge you to continue my videos 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.230
 and I hope everyone is enjoying it 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.669
 enjoying the video lessons and coming soon 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.660
 I'll be posting more video lessons for 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.660
 thank you very much
