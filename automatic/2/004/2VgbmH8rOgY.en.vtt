Michael<00:00:03.030> Porter's<00:00:03.449> five<00:00:03.720> forces<00:00:04.110> approach<00:00:04.920> is

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
Michael Porter's five forces approach is

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.980 
Michael Porter's five forces approach is
now<00:00:05.580> good<00:00:05.879> looking<00:00:06.240> way<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.600> thinking<00:00:06.930> about

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
now good looking way of thinking about

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.560 
now good looking way of thinking about
strategy<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:08.340> starts<00:00:08.730> from<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.940> very<00:00:09.150> simple

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
strategy it starts from a very simple

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.640 
strategy it starts from a very simple
fact<00:00:10.700> industries<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.880> markets<00:00:12.179> very<00:00:12.990> very

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
fact industries and markets very very

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.350 
fact industries and markets very very
widely<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> average<00:00:14.670> profitability<00:00:15.150> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
widely in the average profitability of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.300 
widely in the average profitability of

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.010

therefore<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.670> first<00:00:17.910> step<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.330> strategy<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
therefore the first step in strategy is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
therefore the first step in strategy is
to<00:00:19.350> make<00:00:19.529> sure<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.949> you're<00:00:20.070> competing<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.730> an
