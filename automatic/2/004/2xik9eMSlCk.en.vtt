00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.219
 hello today sum up the test 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.559
 gps lighthouse starline m15 econo 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.490
 energy efficient during the test 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.150
 and it was 21 days the lighthouse did not have time 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.189
 send 1170 to my cell phone 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.250
 and sms messages that by and large 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.890
 corresponds to the stated equal 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.559
 the manufacturer is three years 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.910
 battery life well if you install 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 which beacon in opening mode 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.460
 coordinates definition sent coordinates 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.079
 for 1 day 1 that is, it turns out that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.969
 one set of batteries beacon should 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 send 1095 itself messages this is 306 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.469
 5 days 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:02.149
 1095 may suffer for three years 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:08.159
 mean beacon m13 eco with a vengeance 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:12.180
 I surpassed this figure trying my like 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.820
 rule 1170 messages are several 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 There ancestor 9 was status if 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.570
 requested charge data 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 batteries to predict 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.130
 somehow do n't have any 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 representation how strong 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.409
 the battery of dependence is spent here 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 number and then again messages 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.869
 I'll show you these messages now 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.579
 show battery level on 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:49.409
 certain stages we go on here he 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.829
 our test lighthouse will show really 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.929
 the activation button does not turn on and 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.869
 hold equally light young sweetheart 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:03.599
 he is elected river 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:09.799
 asked us the model of the cr123 battery and her 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:09.799
 voltage is 3 3 volts 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:21.300
 if you make such a request password info to 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.060
 the beacon will send the status of the device all 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.420
 firmware versions and there electrons are wise 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.170
 my 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.190
 and that's what i need is the current 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.010
 battery level on 1100 8 sms 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.390
 he was 2704 microvolts 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:46.070
 respectively wean from three 3300 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 gets its drawdown of about six 100 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.550
 microvolts per 1000 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.070
 for example on roughly 1000 so 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.550
 most juice in this way it will be possible 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.650
 predict us battery discharge 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:04.260
 so the air temperature was 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:08.460
 test time during the day from + 5 to plus 10 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.330
 degrees at night about 0 minus this 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.330
 there was no deep 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.430
 summing up the test can be noted that 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.440
 gps lighthouse starline m15 eco provides 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.880
 autonomous work on that kit 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.590
 batteries up to 3 years 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.700
 since he sent 1177 and this is more 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.040
 than three years of battery life when 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.490
 condition of sending the coordinates once the essence 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.070
 in fact it is the most relevant and 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.120
 unpopular user experience 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.350
 sailors 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.970
 so that 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.840
 test gps beacon and this 15 drips with you was 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.470
 Sergey Sergey 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 to new meetings
