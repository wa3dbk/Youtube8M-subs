00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 to make this ours in priest apple that 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.480
 We'll need and you sprinkle sugar. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.299
 brown sugar mixed with walnut cinnamon 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.800
 broken but chicken where I put a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.830
 bit dry white wine and mass 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 concerned that the full revenue is only 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.800
 enter this link that is here or in the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 video description on youtube dollar on 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.030
 it's that easy 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 I'll get the apple put here. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.820
 She gave the orchard nothing with the river to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.989
 get well the pain of yourself 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.090
 the sugar with cinnamon a good amount 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.899
 this will absorb the hits during the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 corruption process is increased 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.300
 and nuts that will add pro 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.829
 Camsia on our plate 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.829
 now it 's just mixing well I'm living it 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 fill to put the filling enough 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:25.920
 stuffing to give it a pull plus one 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 and now capping 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:38.600
 she 's convinced enough 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.250
 make war makes the cover necklace 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 in that berhad that you left behind 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.990
 and then we're pushing and cutting 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:01.060
 Finishing is done. 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:05.320
 let's beat the egg there without leaving 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.739
 run because if this occurs 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.580
 it becomes more difficult to misinform 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.750
 avoids and very much actually here now 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.739
 goes to the oven at 180 degrees from 30 to 35 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.840
 minutes 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.239
 while it happens it subscribes to the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 our channel and receive all our 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.560

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.080
 the room then ours in for apple and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.269
 there during the kiln corruption process 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.280
 she gives the finish but she makes a 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.049
 because she will assume that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.239
 full of effect 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.150
 one thing compensates the other one we go 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.190
 have enough stuffing inside of the I empa 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.530
 could have put more shallow 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.540
 straight cover would not be tied in the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.700
 beautiful of this calico full because that 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.140
 here no harm in unmold 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:01.329
 in the same way to form again here 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.340
 no problem and now like every 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.190
 apple since we are children we 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.900
 see apple pie resting in the window 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.250
 to be cut we left 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.400
 rest a little bit but went to a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:18.000
 little but it is still short but we are going 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.940
