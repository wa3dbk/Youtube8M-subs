00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Othon you are all of yours to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.759
 To leave, she has to appear here in the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.919

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 Sky heat hill not no more 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 so who does is the picture called a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 simple therapy and is based on 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 stories that you send an sms to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 history of choice to represent the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 most of all I'll read the error here in order to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 of talking about a difficult man all 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.400
 started in the past when it suffered 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.830
 bullying in school and still have leftovers know 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 that is once a girl beat me in the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 in front of everyone when I arrived in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 home and I cut myself to the Chilean people 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 I do this until today it has bulimia and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.180
 Anorexia, please help me, James, well. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 different stories like this and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.899
 unfortunately this machine that is well 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 in the lives of several people for a certain 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.010
 rejection is the whole society 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.329
 itself begins to self-harm people. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.520
 think their way of calling the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 and she really wants to call the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.789
 attention saying you need help is 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.710
 very easy to find subjects like 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.480
 this one especially after discovering 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.879
 What should I do this recently? 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 andretti of the band's castle already 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.260
 was enough for girls and boys 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 I do not know if they like it very much, they do not care 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.710
 I think this is never going to happen. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.600
 with someone you like, you're at 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.040
 times can happen inside your home 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 you're not seeing anyone nor 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 I cut off talking to all real world has 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.710
 people who do this person 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.869
 deserves a stronger treatment there is a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.939
 Especially I do not know a girl to wash or 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 I need to talk here that it's ridiculous you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.409
 someone because she does not even talk or 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.590
 Imagine our scene, how cool is it? 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.140
 girl and she does not speak, I'll spank her 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 sometimes you want even the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.380
 sometimes she is not afraid to speak a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.329
 thing if rejected because if the person 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 hits the other when she does not speak 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.350
 Imagine if she said ours, that's cool. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.520
 A girl and she talks and I'll beat her up. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.320
 joking this part but I have to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 Talking to you today is that lowest thing. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.150
 everyone you do not have to be who you are 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.610
 not 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.290
 to be accepted by people I do not know here 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 with this reality I do not know that with 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.040
 the reality of your family and not the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.690
 trauma you passed since whatever 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.850
 happened to you, did not pass more 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.950
 happened it was bad because this champion 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.840
 experience of your life unfortunately not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.100
 How can you change what has already happened? 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.110
 that you can decide what goes 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
 happen from now on and neither car 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.830
 self-mutilation, it's not better to leave because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.720
 think to me if you've been through 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.850
 I do not speak a lot here. 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.100
 bullying in school then I do not know 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.290
 there from a father to the mother of abuse in his 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.970
 emotional area of a face 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.890
 that even when it is what you like or 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.900
 talking about everything that was hurt one day and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.600
 Tell me it will change if you self 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.650
 continue to cut you not to talk but 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.990
 I get charged because I have the feeling 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.910
 pleasure in this as forgetting everything that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.040
 It hurt me, it's okay, I'm not denying that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.720
 This can happen without practicing it. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.090
 made an attempt to stop only pain 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.190
 whatever emotional start cutting already 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.800
 You forgot that you're hurting yourself. 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.650
 contradictory but in the pain of a 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.959
 cut a razor without your wrist I 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.640
 I prefer mine that day, not thrilled that 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.200
 I felt someone was never in my search for photos 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.060
 Anyway you do this, you'll forget what 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 It's hurting you but why you? 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.530
 to cut itself back in because it is a 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.570
 momentary pleasure is a sensation 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.100
 passenger only serves if called stay 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.530
 sad will remind you of everything 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.450
 what happened because the 165 day marks 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.360
 For you know that everything will be marked. 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.620
 I also know 25 25 years will always be there 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.209
 one more you will want anything with 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.220
 You and it ends up becoming a cycle 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.000
 what makes you become a prisoner in your 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.800
 own pain 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.630
 I do not know, I do not know how much time you practice. 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.760
 But look back and see how much 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.709
 time it became enslaved and see how much 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.410
 time you asked for an escape 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.120
 all that you 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.070
 The time for you to leave it all to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.230
 back and before seeking acceptance of 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.060
 someone she accepts knows how to accept you 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.380
 Even accept everything you've already left 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.610
 everything that was bad because 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.860
 there are thousands of people with the same 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.540
 problem that your other is the greatest proof 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.250
 I received many messages from 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.840
 people talking about the same problem and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.520
 that's where your choice be 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.260
 prisoner of his own pain or 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.000
 to choose happiness 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.680
 I know sometimes it's hard to believe 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.540
 that you can be happy on account of 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.760
 barriers you've encountered in your life 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.470
 but it exists to make it your focus the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.420
 all that you spent a field in search 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.120
 of happiness choose a different life 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.160
 I only saw the body, my love. 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.890
 just need to side the young outside that the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.510
 blade you cut yourself and easy adm 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.250
 be strong and some always like 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.170
 Say you do not need a treat. 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.660
 momentary you deserve to be happy time 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.490
 all look to public affairs and were 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.810
 wants to provoke a lot on this subject but I 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.549
 I am very sad to see that people 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.900
 They are suffering so of course not 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.700
 I can have this video without speaking a 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.190
 thing sometimes you can feel a 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.390
 A single person without friends without anyone and 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.250
 this feeling for you to feel 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.930
 alone can bring a pain for you no 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.880
 have me share the moments that you 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.920
 It is going through experience of 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.630
 God will never let you go if you will cancel. 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.370
 at the time you went on Sundays and closed 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.140
 the eyes and talk to him you can 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.009
 Looks like an error, but I'm not. 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.020
 talking here 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.789
 They were talking about something bigger than God. 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.139
 First, talk to him and tell him everything. 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.300
 it's worth trying 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.099
 Always remember animals and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.969
 value more because if you do not 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.249
 this for you 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.559

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.869
