mascara on again and this time I'm

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
mascara on again and this time I'm
focusing<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> tips<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
focusing as much on the tips as I can

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.780 
focusing as much on the tips as I can
and<00:01:27.360> doing<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.200> better<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> job

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and doing a little bit better of a job

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
and doing a little bit better of a job
but<00:01:29.790> again<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.479> wanting<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> travel<00:01:31.650> down<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
but again it's wanting to travel down to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:43.420 
but again it's wanting to travel down to
the<00:01:32.610> base<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> lash

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.880

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.200 
so this is the overall effect and it
does<00:01:46.040> look<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.280> little<00:01:46.370> bit<00:01:46.520> clumpy<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:46.970> you
