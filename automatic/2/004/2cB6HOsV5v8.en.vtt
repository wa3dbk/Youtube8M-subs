00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.890
 the only hitch and welcome to the new tutorial year before tutoring 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.570
 by the team 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.570
 I realized that there were a lot of people 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:14.320
 on constructions 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 ideas that kills all this wandering 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.890
 but you do not have a microphone 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.989
 not 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.249
 necessarily the software adapted to turn 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.669
 we think we still need a bike powerful enough 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.819
 eric you want to share 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.250
 what you can do is send me a mp 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.330
 on Youtube 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.510
 or so for those who are bent over the study of very good note neil 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.070
 restriction in the video description 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 and you just see me a message with the shield 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.160
 and I too have the time 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.200
 another who discover earlier 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.210
 it must be something relevant because here is why you 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.429
 we are doing a very festive 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.180
 how can I do it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 whitman and already asked for a goal 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 number of sheep being sent a message 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.980
 I make the video I quote you 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.380
 it was idea I was inspired maÃ¯tÃ© departure dahmane 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.100
 see all this hate 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.040
 to tell you that if you have any ideas do we 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670
 find people 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.370
 proton tutorial then 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.350
 first of all for this tutor i will first explain to you how to make a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.530
 big door 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.850
 not necessarily 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.150
 tadic locke and gravel it can be sablar just one thing 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.050
 gravity 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.890
 and here is the rest it will be for the second part of night 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.650
 so if it is a euro castle 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.500
 just for the occasion 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.770
 so with sully doutre 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.340
 say goodbye to the doors that will go on stage in a gesture that will sing since all 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.330
 on time so 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.870
 an attorney as sylvain distin make it hit 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.430
 do not nantais me 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.640
 so if he will teach you by a good door but it's not so stupid 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.630
 personally for a castle enters with two miserable carried by 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.190
 actress 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.260
 people are starting to say it's not class 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
 I was aggressive enough and did not lose more than 5% 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 first of all 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.480
 I explained how to do 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 abused the gravity of the game first we will do m 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.509
 a line 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.799
 then we will place one we appreciate so much 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.199
 this torch 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.199
 % I knew that when we put for example 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.399
 I find that 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.359
 yahoo his first exit down here is 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.999
 the goal that he was sad 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.409
 but from what counts the torch is laid the sugar cost components 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.799
 the porsche is considered an object 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.169
 it worked out you can go underneath 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.069
 according to who what 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.319
 lowland thanks to what can I say 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.139
 Cuba where m 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.189
 the secret of this temper 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.049
 I continue q how 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 I am of a character I explain to you why in this framework explains to you 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.419
 sign of a torch 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.179
 will increase tenfold 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.179
 the offer made otherwise addiction works more 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.649
 I may have a young audience I do not know 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.529
 always be superstitious but as it happens simply 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.189
 cross 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.209
 I would have screwed 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 I agree 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.259
 the last 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.259
 besides I will not adapt the mouth size to all 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.519
 he is forced to make a hole in the castle 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 I did not want to agree what would happen in the architecture 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:39.650
 do you know that 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.719
 when we have a block example I'm taking 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.769
 we have a solid block 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.189
 and break below 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.899
 quebec torch repair 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:52.479
 700 pieces with a chain reaction we chained physics engine 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.159
 that is, bakassi am here 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.230
 those who moved I'm here so bring down this optics the loss or 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.909
 sperm 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.909
 bush to perpetually whack after seven years 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.009
 it is a door that is good but is quite long 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.899
 set up this kind 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:07.959
 a criteria 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:08.819
 fear 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.049
 hiding a treasure of war of torture 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.600
 that's how the door system works 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.279
 of course we can do more 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.459
 now control 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.419
 let's get into the second part of chaos theory and videos 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.590
 you since you see there 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.639
 you see a quarter of an hour 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.370
 I still see 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.200
 we will learn how to create a secret chamber like this 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.909
 it means that you come back like that 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:31.680
 but you have nothing 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.699
 so it can be handy to hide objects sector this holiday less 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:35.900
 dear in all this 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.199
 I am poor 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.300
 to create serious 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.479
 this secret room you need a pickaxe 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.969
 we do not need to fart 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.300
 break everything 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.409
 boukris a small room in the back 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.559
 it is there in the belly and by the painting 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.729
 cb 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.729
 we do not talk much 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 the dimensions can vary between fleeing 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.289
 yesterday morning yet it's just for the stif 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.610
 I am not an extremely low architect 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.210
 then against here 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.589
 entrance by close 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.180
 although I love 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.490
 so that's possible 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.490
 to make a secret room does not go out like that lasts 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.270
 in fact it's money 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.360
 power we created a simple 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.530
 the qualified secretary 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.499
 it is necessary but you do not have doors 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:45.210
 the door is considered an object 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.930
 this room 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.330
 we were at the table above 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.370
 what is considered to be one of the accused 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.029
 the table takes the form 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.029
 then you were wrong 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.680
 you know that opening the outside door 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.680
 and here you can go because the tables over cross 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.349
 we can certainly in the practical format to hide stuff and supports his cards 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.819
 it's a room with them 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.810
 America if it's not a good painting 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.180
 there is no status quo murray will not look any longer 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.550
 I wanted to hide 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.550
 yes because I'm still going to other big paintings of local rappers 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.939
 then we can close and not there 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.060
 so if you do not enclose interfax I'm still multi making purpose 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.849
 lock them up 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.539
 you disconnect like that the person even if he tries to get in 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.509
 In the picture 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.119
 and fights 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.409
 it's a disadvantage 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.869
 or sure if someone is doing 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.610
 his goal of ornano 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.289
 this is the default 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.789
 the technical chief is like and yet roger had had a fact 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.529
 for an iron door 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.559
 good housekeeping 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:56.559
 the struck volume we realize that it is useless 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.710
 beat a little earlier 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.960
 it's such a fast tutorial between eight and ten 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.960
 no I do not tire you the healing aspect 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.020
 so I have 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.009
 I added 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.550
 quoted by the power 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.610
 d 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.080
 If you have any ideas 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.180
 if you have any ideas do not hesitate 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.330
 amy release especially if the price did not afford half-turn but 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.210
 so I repeat I would put 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.389
 but he has in video distribution 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.099
 and I'm waiting 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:27.499
 a course suggestions 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:28.479
 and I will quote 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.379
 wu poh-hsiung for this kind 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:31.199
 in the middle Ages 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:34.490
