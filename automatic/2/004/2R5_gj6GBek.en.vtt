you<00:00:04.290> know<00:00:04.440> sometimes<00:00:04.890> you're<00:00:05.100> asked<00:00:05.460> to

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
you know sometimes you're asked to

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.900 
you know sometimes you're asked to
inspect<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.359> tree<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.170> give<00:00:08.160> your<00:00:08.340> opinion<00:00:08.429> on

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
inspect a tree and give your opinion on

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.540 
inspect a tree and give your opinion on
the<00:00:09.090> safety<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> tree<00:00:09.960> that's<00:00:10.620> quite<00:00:11.040> sure

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
the safety of the tree that's quite sure

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.690 
the safety of the tree that's quite sure
what<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.880> say<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> when<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.130> look<00:00:14.340> at<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.610> of

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
what to say so when I look at one of

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.849 
what to say so when I look at one of
these<00:00:14.790> big<00:00:15.000> trees<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:16.080> particular<00:00:16.619> tree<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
these big trees this particular tree is

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.179 
these big trees this particular tree is
a<00:00:17.070> Coast<00:00:18.000> live<00:00:18.359> oak<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:19.619> thing<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:19.920> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a Coast live oak the first thing I do is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.429 
a Coast live oak the first thing I do is
I<00:00:20.279> inspect<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> base<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
I inspect the base and I can see that it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.790 
I inspect the base and I can see that it
has<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.920> number<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.760> roots<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.689> appear<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.650> be

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
has a number of roots that appear to be

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.019 
has a number of roots that appear to be
growing<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> correct<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:29.550> correct<00:00:29.699> way

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
growing in the correct the correct way

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
growing in the correct the correct way
that<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> tree<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.230> size<00:00:31.289> should<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.830> on

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
that a tree of this size should be on

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
that a tree of this size should be on
its<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.489> tree<00:00:32.669> doesn't<00:00:32.820> appear<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.390> been

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
its the tree doesn't appear to have been

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.220 
its the tree doesn't appear to have been
buried<00:00:34.219> but<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:36.020> observation<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
buried but I do have a observation that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.680 
buried but I do have a observation that
at<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.370> time<00:00:39.110> there<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> road<00:00:40.649> put<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
at one time there was a road put in and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
at one time there was a road put in and
roots<00:00:42.690> were<00:00:43.170> likely<00:00:43.710> severed<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> outside

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
roots were likely severed on the outside

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.130 
roots were likely severed on the outside
of<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.210> tree<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.579> good

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
of this tree so that's that's not good

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.290 
of this tree so that's that's not good
another<00:00:49.140> thing<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> observed<00:00:50.309> was<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.180> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
another thing that I observed was as I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.200 
another thing that I observed was as I
was<00:00:51.329> looking<00:00:51.539> at<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> base<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> tree<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
was looking at the base of the tree I

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.160 
was looking at the base of the tree I
found<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.600> decay<00:00:55.350> pocket<00:00:55.829> down<00:00:56.010> here

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
found this little decay pocket down here

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.330 
found this little decay pocket down here
this<00:00:58.170> whole<00:00:58.620> area<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.930> seems<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> be

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
this whole area right here seems to be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.630 
this whole area right here seems to be
compromised<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.489> it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
compromised and you can see that it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.539 
compromised and you can see that it's
it's<00:01:06.240> rotted<00:01:06.659> inside<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.280> we've<00:01:08.430> got

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it's rotted inside so we know we've got

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.270 
it's rotted inside so we know we've got
some<00:01:08.729> weakness<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> base<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.840> tree

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
some weakness at the base of the tree

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.030 
some weakness at the base of the tree
keep<00:01:11.280> looking<00:01:11.640> around

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
keep looking around

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.250 
keep looking around
doesn't<00:01:14.420> visibly

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.780 

on<00:01:21.410> this<00:01:21.620> side<00:01:22.510> looks<00:01:23.510> like<00:01:23.780> there<00:01:24.580> may<00:01:25.580> be<00:01:25.610> a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
on this side looks like there may be a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.550 
on this side looks like there may be a
problem<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:26.480> it's<00:01:26.630> not<00:01:26.690> jumping<00:01:27.170> right<00:01:27.320> out

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
problem but it's not jumping right out

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560 
problem but it's not jumping right out
at<00:01:27.740> me<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.070> not<00:01:28.190> dummy<00:01:29.000> concern<00:01:31.390> okay<00:01:32.390> my

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
at me it's not dummy concern okay my

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.010 
at me it's not dummy concern okay my
next<00:01:33.140> observation<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:34.570> this<00:01:35.570> entire

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
next observation is that this entire

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.000 
next observation is that this entire
tree<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:37.240> growing<00:01:38.240> pretty<00:01:39.170> much<00:01:39.410> one<00:01:39.680> sided

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
tree is growing pretty much one sided

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.030 
tree is growing pretty much one sided
it's<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:41.060> leaning<00:01:41.480> away<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:42.680> actually

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it's it's leaning away it's actually

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.430 
it's it's leaning away it's actually
leaning<00:01:43.280> towards<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.990> building<00:01:44.990> down<00:01:45.170> there

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
leaning towards the building down there

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.400 
leaning towards the building down there
so<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.730> is<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.630> little<00:01:48.020> bit<00:01:48.140> imbalanced<00:01:48.860> there

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
so it is a little bit imbalanced there

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.150 
so it is a little bit imbalanced there
is<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.920> wound<00:01:52.400> here<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:54.590> kind<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.920> hard<00:01:55.100> to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
is a wound here that is kind of hard to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:05.010 
is a wound here that is kind of hard to
see<00:01:55.430> but<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.940> may<00:01:56.840> cause<00:01:57.740> some<00:01:57.920> compromised

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.280 

Wow<00:02:09.280> entirely<00:02:10.280> Hollow<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:12.680> not<00:02:14.110> looked<00:02:15.110> in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
Wow entirely Hollow and I not looked in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.290 
Wow entirely Hollow and I not looked in
here<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.590> might<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.160> have<00:02:16.190> recognized<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
here I might not have recognized the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.850 
here I might not have recognized the
extent<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.050> hollow<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:20.300> tree<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:21.650> my

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
extent of this hollow so this tree in my

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.150 
extent of this hollow so this tree in my
opinion<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:23.380> potentially<00:02:24.380> very<00:02:24.410> very<00:02:24.890> weak

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
opinion is potentially very very weak

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.449 
opinion is potentially very very weak
especially<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.510> one<00:02:29.830> do<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.920> see<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> couple

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
especially that one do you see a couple

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.820 
especially that one do you see a couple
of<00:02:31.520> cables<00:02:31.760> up<00:02:32.150> there<00:02:32.740> way<00:02:33.740> way<00:02:34.160> up<00:02:34.310> high<00:02:35.830> so

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
of cables up there way way up high so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.680 
of cables up there way way up high so

so<00:02:50.780> presumably<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.830> power<00:02:52.040> company<00:02:52.550> comes

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
so presumably the power company comes

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.850 
so presumably the power company comes
through<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.300> cuts<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.590> some

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
through and cuts on it I can see some

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.100 
through and cuts on it I can see some
cuts<00:02:55.130> up<00:02:55.310> there<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:55.700> that's<00:02:55.790> not<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.810> real

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
cuts up there but that's not a real

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.370 
cuts up there but that's not a real
significant<00:02:57.890> area<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:59.810> another<00:03:00.080> weakness

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
significant area like another weakness

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.360 
significant area like another weakness
of<00:03:01.959> here<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.770> this<00:03:03.950> whole<00:03:04.280> area<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.160> weakness

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
of here so this whole area is a weakness

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.780 
of here so this whole area is a weakness
right<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:08.030> there<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:09.560> whole<00:03:09.770> area<00:03:10.100> may<00:03:10.430> have

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
right up there this whole area may have

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.520 
right up there this whole area may have
some<00:03:11.330> decay<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.840> there<00:03:12.020> may<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.320> been

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
some decay in there may have been

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.180 
some decay in there may have been
following<00:03:16.209> don't<00:03:17.209> quite<00:03:17.390> know<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:18.070> think<00:03:19.070> it's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
following don't quite know I think it's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.370 
following don't quite know I think it's
hazardous
