you can trust me and what do you think
the<00:00:53.699> draw<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.969> why<00:00:54.629> why<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.199> compare<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the draw is why why this compare to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
the draw is why why this compare to
anything<00:00:55.829> else<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.489> aesthetic<00:00:57.030> appeal<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
anything else the aesthetic appeal is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
anything else the aesthetic appeal is
incredible<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.289> mean<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
incredible I mean you're up there in a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
incredible I mean you're up there in a
beautiful<00:00:59.820> streamlined<00:01:00.480> aircraft<00:01:01.289> free<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820

I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.600> they're<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> most

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I think they're one of the most

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.279 
I think they're one of the most
beautiful<00:01:08.369> machines<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:09.000> there

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
beautiful machines out there

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.920 
beautiful machines out there
go<00:01:10.829> take<00:01:11.039> a<00:01:11.070> look<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> glider<00:01:11.759> it's<00:01:12.600> really

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
go take a look at the glider it's really

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.459 
go take a look at the glider it's really
long

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
long

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.620 
long
yeah<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> wings<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.520> long<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.539> we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
yeah the wings are long that's what we

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
yeah the wings are long that's what we
call<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> high<00:01:16.110> aspect<00:01:16.619> ratio<00:01:16.770> wing<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.789> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
call a high aspect ratio wing and that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
call a high aspect ratio wing and that
gives<00:01:18.240> us<00:01:18.450> lower<00:01:19.289> drag<00:01:19.679> at<00:01:19.950> slow<00:01:20.189> speeds<00:01:20.579> which

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
gives us lower drag at slow speeds which

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.310 
gives us lower drag at slow speeds which
is<00:01:20.969> where<00:01:21.179> we're<00:01:21.360> flying<00:01:21.630> most<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> time

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
is where we're flying most of the time

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
is where we're flying most of the time
you'll<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.649> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> front<00:01:23.130> seat<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> I'll

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you'll be in the front seat and I'll

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
you'll be in the front seat and I'll
give<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.929> good<00:01:25.079> briefing<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.649> how<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:25.860> fly

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
give you a good briefing on how to fly

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.669 
give you a good briefing on how to fly
it<00:01:26.250> okay<00:01:26.819> and<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.360> some<00:01:27.659> point<00:01:27.929> I'll<00:01:28.110> let<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
it okay and at some point I'll let you

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.520 
it okay and at some point I'll let you
take<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> controls<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.819> like<00:01:30.170> not<00:01:31.170> for

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
take the controls if you like not for

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.719 
take the controls if you like not for
real<00:01:31.860> long<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.520> you're

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
real long a little bit and if you're

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.889 
real long a little bit and if you're
doing<00:01:35.969> great<00:01:36.149> maybe<00:01:36.450> it'll<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> little

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
doing great maybe it'll be a little

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.289 
doing great maybe it'll be a little
longer<00:01:37.259> okay<00:01:37.770> yeah<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.759> these<00:01:38.850> yarn

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
longer okay yeah and what are these yarn

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.209 
longer okay yeah and what are these yarn
things<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.899> top<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.679> that's<00:01:40.920> uh
