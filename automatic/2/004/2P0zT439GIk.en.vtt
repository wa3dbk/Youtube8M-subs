00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
first thing I do is to check what I've

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.200 
first thing I do is to check what I've
got<00:00:01.560> any<00:00:01.709> been<00:00:01.860> shot<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.310> know<00:00:02.520> I've<00:00:02.610> got<00:00:02.790> one<00:00:03.000> I

got any been shot I know I've got one I

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.150 
got any been shot I know I've got one I
felt<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.049> resistance<00:00:04.470> when<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.710> was<00:00:04.830> pulling

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
felt the resistance when I was pulling

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.950 
felt the resistance when I was pulling
the<00:00:05.279> shelf<00:00:06.000> down<00:00:06.210> that's<00:00:06.450> usually<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> clear

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the shelf down that's usually a clear

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.049 
the shelf down that's usually a clear
sign<00:00:07.170> but<00:00:07.890> what<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.250> also<00:00:08.340> do<00:00:08.580> by<00:00:08.730> rolling

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
sign but what you can also do by rolling

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.280 
sign but what you can also do by rolling
them<00:00:11.210> you<00:00:12.210> can<00:00:12.360> see<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.019> here

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
them you can see that this one here

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.560 
them you can see that this one here
doesn't<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.250> roll<00:00:14.429> easily<00:00:14.639> where<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
doesn't like to roll easily where the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
doesn't like to roll easily where the
others<00:00:15.780> these<00:00:16.470> are<00:00:16.590> all<00:00:16.619> quite<00:00:17.039> dirty<00:00:17.279> a

goes off luckily I had a few here a
couple<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.930> brand-new<00:00:55.350> shafts<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.100> there

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
couple of brand-new shafts so there

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
couple of brand-new shafts so there
before<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.199> also<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
before i will be using now is also the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.209 
before i will be using now is also the
time<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.910> give<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.510> cogs<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.739> gears<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
time to give your cogs and your gears a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.060 
time to give your cogs and your gears a
really<00:01:02.699> good<00:01:02.879> inspection<00:01:03.890> what<00:01:04.890> will

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
really good inspection what will

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
really good inspection what will
probably<00:01:05.220> help<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> bit

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
probably help you do this there's a bit

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.550 
probably help you do this there's a bit
of<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> white<00:01:07.830> paper<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.260> at<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> end<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
of bit of white paper and at the end of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740 
of bit of white paper and at the end of
day<00:01:10.680> feeding<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.340> looking<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:11.760> closely<00:01:12.270> now

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
day feeding and looking very closely now

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
day feeding and looking very closely now
I've<00:01:12.900> already<00:01:13.140> noticed<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.710> damage<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.130> this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I've already noticed some damage on this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
I've already noticed some damage on this
cog<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.270> tooth<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.930> damaged<00:01:16.320> there

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
cog there's a a tooth of damaged there

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.460 
cog there's a a tooth of damaged there
nothing<00:01:17.130> drastic<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
nothing drastic and a little bit of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870 
nothing drastic and a little bit of
damage<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.729> probably

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
damage on that one so I'm probably

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
damage on that one so I'm probably
replace<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:22.040> let's<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.250> quickly

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
replace that one let's just quickly

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
replace that one let's just quickly
again<00:01:23.759> spin<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.540> round<00:01:25.640> looks<00:01:26.640> good<00:01:27.140> get

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
again spin this one round looks good get

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.200 
again spin this one round looks good get
on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:28.439> side<00:01:30.170> another<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:34.700> looks<00:01:35.700> good

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
on the good side another one looks good

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.390 
on the good side another one looks good
and<00:01:38.210> another<00:01:38.870> one<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.710> think<00:01:39.860> I've<00:01:40.220> had<00:01:40.340> a

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
and another one so I think I've had a

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.910 
and another one so I think I've had a
couple<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.030> got<00:01:41.210> damaged<00:01:41.680> whether<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:42.830> is

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
couple that got damaged whether it is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.580 
couple that got damaged whether it is
all<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.280> do<00:01:43.430> with<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:43.640> crush<00:01:44.030> or<00:01:44.690> not<00:01:45.050> not

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
all to do with this crush or not not

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.460 
all to do with this crush or not not
hunting<00:01:46.010> shore<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:47.780> also<00:01:47.930> looks<00:01:48.170> good

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
hunting shore and that also looks good

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.520 
hunting shore and that also looks good
so<00:01:48.980> certainly<00:01:49.520> I've<00:01:49.760> had<00:01:49.940> damage<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.600> this

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
so certainly I've had damage to this

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.430 
so certainly I've had damage to this
column<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.150> it's<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.720> see<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:53.990> also<00:01:54.260> edge

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
column here it's I can see it also edge

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.400 
column here it's I can see it also edge
on<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.370> little<00:01:55.490> bit<00:01:55.670> warm<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.750> I've<00:01:57.230> got
