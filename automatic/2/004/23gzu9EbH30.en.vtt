I was an acquisition last year we got it

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.060 
I was an acquisition last year we got it
all<00:00:13.329> together<00:00:13.480> it's<00:00:13.809> ready<00:00:14.019> to<00:00:14.079> test<00:00:14.379> fly<00:00:14.559> so

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
all together it's ready to test fly so

00:00:15.070 --> 00:01:04.620 
all together it's ready to test fly so
let's<00:00:15.669> go<00:00:15.789> check<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:16.270> out

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.660 

this<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:05.899> export<00:01:06.590> airplane<00:01:07.130> back<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:07.549> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
this was a export airplane back in the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.240 
this was a export airplane back in the
30s<00:01:08.149> Libya<00:01:08.659> pretty<00:01:09.020> much<00:01:09.200> used<00:01:09.500> most<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.100> a

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
30s Libya pretty much used most of it a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.609 
30s Libya pretty much used most of it a
little<00:01:10.490> 30<00:01:11.119> caliber<00:01:11.600> machine<00:01:11.960> gun<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:12.470> a

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
little 30 caliber machine gun it's a

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.530 
little 30 caliber machine gun it's a
two-position<00:01:13.190> propeller<00:01:13.820> which<00:01:14.030> i've<00:01:14.210> never

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
two-position propeller which i've never

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.450 
two-position propeller which i've never
flown<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:15.500> that's<00:01:15.679> going<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:16.009> interesting

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
flown so that's going to be interesting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.090 
flown so that's going to be interesting
and<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:17.570> got<00:01:17.720> these<00:01:17.869> cute<00:01:18.350> little<00:01:18.380> spats

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
and it's got these cute little spats

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.710 
and it's got these cute little spats
that<00:01:19.399> cover<00:01:19.640> up<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.910> landing<00:01:20.270> gear<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.539> is

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
that cover up the landing gear this is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840 
that cover up the landing gear this is
before<00:01:20.810> they<00:01:21.140> started<00:01:21.860> using<00:01:21.950> retractable

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
before they started using retractable

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.060 
before they started using retractable
gear<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:23.179> a<00:01:23.270> great<00:01:23.560> transition<00:01:24.560> period

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
gear it's a great transition period

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.910 
gear it's a great transition period
airplane<00:01:25.970> showing<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.539> evolution<00:01:27.110> from<00:01:27.350> you

airplane showing the evolution from you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.620 
airplane showing the evolution from you
know<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.190> fabric<00:01:28.550> by<00:01:28.729> planes<00:01:29.149> into<00:01:29.539> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
know the fabric by planes into the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
know the fabric by planes into the
monoplanes<00:01:30.259> made<00:01:30.830> out<00:01:31.009> of<00:01:31.159> metal<00:01:31.399> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
monoplanes made out of metal and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.149 
monoplanes made out of metal and
originally<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.750> know<00:01:32.929> they<00:01:33.110> just<00:01:33.350> covered

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
originally you know they just covered

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.100 
originally you know they just covered
the<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.850> fixed<00:01:35.149> landing<00:01:35.300> gear<00:01:35.479> with<00:01:35.750> spats

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
the the fixed landing gear with spats

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.870 
the the fixed landing gear with spats
and<00:01:36.409> there<00:01:36.920> was<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.039> later<00:01:37.310> version<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.759> this

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
and there was a later version of this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.380 
and there was a later version of this
which<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.210> also<00:01:38.509> have<00:01:38.929> which<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.319> CW<00:01:39.710> 22<00:01:40.670> that

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
which I also have which is a CW 22 that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.359 
which I also have which is a CW 22 that
has<00:01:41.539> retractable<00:01:42.200> gear<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:42.740> maybe<00:01:43.069> after<00:01:43.190> I

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
has retractable gear so maybe after I

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.740 
has retractable gear so maybe after I
fly<00:01:43.610> this<00:01:43.850> one<00:01:44.030> will<00:01:44.210> start<00:01:44.420> looking<00:01:44.509> at<00:01:44.690> the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
fly this one will start looking at the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:03:14.720 
fly this one will start looking at the
other<00:01:44.960> one

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:04:21.749 

like<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> race

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.899 

anyway<00:04:22.759> so<00:04:22.819> that's<00:04:23.210> uh<00:04:23.569> that's<00:04:24.110> pretty<00:04:24.259> cool

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
airplane oh my god and it was a very

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.129 
airplane oh my god and it was a very
interesting<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.629> first<00:04:50.810> time<00:04:50.960> I've<00:04:51.110> ever

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
interesting is the first time I've ever

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.540 
interesting is the first time I've ever
flown<00:04:51.440> an<00:04:51.620> airplane<00:04:51.770> with<00:04:52.009> a<00:04:52.039> two-position

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
flown an airplane with a two-position

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.459 
flown an airplane with a two-position
prop<00:04:52.969> kind<00:04:53.719> of<00:04:53.780> caught<00:04:53.960> me<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> little<00:04:54.349> bit

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
prop kind of caught me a little bit

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.499 
prop kind of caught me a little bit
surprised<00:04:54.830> on<00:04:55.039> takeoff<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.639> took<00:04:55.849> off<00:04:56.030> in<00:04:56.210> fine

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
surprised on takeoff I took off in fine

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.369 
surprised on takeoff I took off in fine
pitch<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.680> RPM<00:04:58.250> was<00:04:58.969> pretty<00:04:59.750> much<00:04:59.900> going<00:05:00.169> up

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
pitch the RPM was pretty much going up

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.969 
pitch the RPM was pretty much going up
to<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.590> redline<00:05:00.979> way<00:05:01.490> before<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.060> expected<00:05:02.629> the

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
to the redline way before I expected the

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.619 
to the redline way before I expected the
the<00:05:03.979> manifold<00:05:04.460> pressure<00:05:04.759> because<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.300> was<00:05:05.449> up

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
the manifold pressure because it was up

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.379 
the manifold pressure because it was up
but<00:05:05.780> oh<00:05:06.229> maybe<00:05:06.949> twenty<00:05:07.759> three<00:05:08.000> twenty<00:05:08.360> four

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
but oh maybe twenty three twenty four

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.089 
but oh maybe twenty three twenty four
inches<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:08.900> manifold<00:05:09.229> pressure<00:05:09.469> it'll<00:05:09.830> go<00:05:10.039> to

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
inches of manifold pressure it'll go to

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.490 
inches of manifold pressure it'll go to
thirty<00:05:10.550> five<00:05:10.909> and<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.180> half<00:05:11.210> inches<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:11.930> I'd

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
thirty five and a half inches and I'd

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.959 
thirty five and a half inches and I'd
already<00:05:12.710> hit<00:05:12.949> the<00:05:12.979> redline<00:05:13.430> by<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.729> time<00:05:13.940> I

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
already hit the redline by the time I

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.580 
already hit the redline by the time I
before<00:05:14.389> I<00:05:14.419> got<00:05:14.599> the<00:05:14.719> twenty<00:05:14.960> five<00:05:15.080> inches<00:05:15.349> so

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
before I got the twenty five inches so

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.649 
before I got the twenty five inches so
that<00:05:15.620> surprised<00:05:16.250> me<00:05:16.490> anyway<00:05:17.150> so<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.330> kept<00:05:17.569> the

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
that surprised me anyway so I kept the

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.119 
that surprised me anyway so I kept the
blue<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:17.990> red<00:05:18.110> line<00:05:18.349> went<00:05:18.560> ahead<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.830> climbed

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
blue the red line went ahead and climbed

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.399 
blue the red line went ahead and climbed
out<00:05:19.340> like<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:19.879> got<00:05:20.389> up<00:05:20.509> to<00:05:20.629> about<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.840> thousand

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
out like that got up to about a thousand

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.589 
out like that got up to about a thousand
feet<00:05:21.650> let<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.039> attempt<00:05:22.400> cooled<00:05:22.639> off<00:05:22.940> went

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
feet let the attempt cooled off went

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.170 
feet let the attempt cooled off went
ahead<00:05:23.719> and<00:05:24.409> you<00:05:25.279> know<00:05:25.400> flew<00:05:25.610> around<00:05:25.909> for<00:05:26.120> a

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
ahead and you know flew around for a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.550 
ahead and you know flew around for a
little<00:05:26.300> bit<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.750> then<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:26.930> went<00:05:27.050> ahead<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:27.289> put

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
little bit and then I went ahead and put

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.490 
little bit and then I went ahead and put
it<00:05:27.710> into<00:05:28.069> a<00:05:28.400> course<00:05:29.029> pitch<00:05:29.360> which<00:05:30.050> is<00:05:30.080> actually

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
it into a course pitch which is actually

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.920 
it into a course pitch which is actually
forward<00:05:31.039> on<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.310> throttle<00:05:31.759> quadrant<00:05:31.930> the

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
forward on the throttle quadrant the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.200 
forward on the throttle quadrant the
prop<00:05:33.259> came<00:05:33.620> back<00:05:33.889> much<00:05:34.400> quicker<00:05:34.789> than<00:05:34.940> it

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
prop came back much quicker than it

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.749 
prop came back much quicker than it
cycled<00:05:35.599> on<00:05:35.719> the<00:05:35.840> ground<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:37.639> was

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
cycled on the ground and so that was

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.700 
cycled on the ground and so that was
interesting<00:05:37.909> and<00:05:38.419> at<00:05:38.569> that<00:05:38.779> point<00:05:39.199> everything

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
interesting and at that point everything

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.860 
interesting and at that point everything
seemed<00:05:40.009> to<00:05:40.069> settle<00:05:40.370> in<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.699> put<00:05:40.909> it<00:05:41.000> about<00:05:41.240> 1900

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
seemed to settle in I put it about 1900

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.240 
seemed to settle in I put it about 1900
rpm<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.639> it<00:05:43.639> was<00:05:43.789> about<00:05:44.090> I'd<00:05:44.659> say<00:05:44.840> about<00:05:44.960> 27<00:05:45.860> 27

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
rpm and it was about I'd say about 27 27

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.649 
rpm and it was about I'd say about 27 27
and<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.490> half<00:05:46.550> inches<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:46.940> manifold<00:05:47.389> pressure

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
and a half inches of manifold pressure

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.080 
and a half inches of manifold pressure
so<00:05:48.020> that<00:05:48.620> felt<00:05:48.830> very<00:05:49.039> comfortable<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.699> me<00:05:49.879> I

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
so that felt very comfortable to me I

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.640 
so that felt very comfortable to me I
can't<00:05:50.509> remember<00:05:50.629> exactly<00:05:51.080> what<00:05:51.259> the<00:05:51.319> airplane

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
can't remember exactly what the airplane

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.619 
can't remember exactly what the airplane
cruises<00:05:52.129> at<00:05:52.310> but<00:05:52.550> seems<00:05:53.090> like<00:05:53.210> it<00:05:53.360> was<00:05:53.449> always

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
cruises at but seems like it was always

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.189 
cruises at but seems like it was always
around<00:05:53.840> 140<00:05:54.500> mile<00:05:54.680> an<00:05:54.830> hour<00:05:54.889> range<00:05:55.719> flies<00:05:56.719> very

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
around 140 mile an hour range flies very

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.260 
around 140 mile an hour range flies very
nice<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:59.349> the<00:06:00.460> after<00:06:01.460> I<00:06:01.490> flew<00:06:01.789> around<00:06:01.849> for<00:06:02.210> a

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
nice and the after I flew around for a

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.909 
nice and the after I flew around for a
little<00:06:02.389> bit<00:06:02.539> I<00:06:02.870> went<00:06:03.110> ahead<00:06:03.259> to<00:06:03.529> you<00:06:03.800> know

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
little bit I went ahead to you know

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.890 
little bit I went ahead to you know
cycle<00:06:04.490> back<00:06:04.669> the<00:06:04.849> propeller<00:06:05.240> back<00:06:05.479> to<00:06:05.629> fine

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
cycle back the propeller back to fine

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.749 
cycle back the propeller back to fine
pitch<00:06:06.199> I<00:06:06.440> could<00:06:06.770> never<00:06:06.949> get<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:07.310> come<00:06:07.460> back<00:06:07.610> to

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
pitch I could never get it come back to

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.700 
pitch I could never get it come back to
fine<00:06:08.000> pitch<00:06:08.330> so<00:06:08.629> we're<00:06:09.110> going<00:06:09.199> to<00:06:09.319> take<00:06:09.469> a<00:06:09.500> look

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
fine pitch so we're going to take a look

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.800 
fine pitch so we're going to take a look
at<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.889> prop<00:06:10.159> there's<00:06:11.000> still<00:06:11.270> one<00:06:11.509> left

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
at the prop there's still one left

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.749 
at the prop there's still one left
landing<00:06:12.169> gear<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.590> understand<00:06:13.159> it's<00:06:13.370> hanging

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
landing gear I understand it's hanging

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.909 
landing gear I understand it's hanging
out<00:06:13.940> it<00:06:14.509> appears<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:14.960> there's<00:06:15.229> a<00:06:15.319> little<00:06:15.529> pin

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
out it appears that there's a little pin

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.279 
out it appears that there's a little pin
that's<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.669> little<00:06:16.879> bit<00:06:17.000> too<00:06:17.240> short<00:06:17.270> and<00:06:17.960> it's

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
that's a little bit too short and it's

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.469 
that's a little bit too short and it's
not<00:06:18.469> quite<00:06:18.770> engaging<00:06:19.279> that<00:06:19.639> left<00:06:19.940> strut<00:06:20.300> when

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
not quite engaging that left strut when

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.070 
not quite engaging that left strut when
it<00:06:20.599> comes

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
it comes

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.619 
it comes
to<00:06:21.500> hold<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.979> for<00:06:22.490> flying<00:06:22.819> around<00:06:23.120> normally

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
to hold it for flying around normally

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.350 
to hold it for flying around normally
once<00:06:24.139> the<00:06:24.319> flaps<00:06:24.710> are<00:06:25.069> brought<00:06:25.280> down<00:06:25.310> the<00:06:26.060> pins

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
once the flaps are brought down the pins

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.050 
once the flaps are brought down the pins
come<00:06:26.659> out<00:06:26.840> and<00:06:27.020> the<00:06:27.199> landing<00:06:27.500> gear<00:06:27.560> drops<00:06:28.060> and

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
come out and the landing gear drops and

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.080 
come out and the landing gear drops and
it<00:06:29.270> blends<00:06:29.750> very<00:06:30.379> very<00:06:30.680> softly<00:06:31.219> I'm<00:06:31.400> very<00:06:31.819> very

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
it blends very very softly I'm very very

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.999 
it blends very very softly I'm very very
surprised<00:06:32.539> seems<00:06:33.319> like<00:06:33.500> it's<00:06:33.620> probably<00:06:33.979> I

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
surprised seems like it's probably I

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.100 
surprised seems like it's probably I
didn't<00:06:34.370> approach<00:06:34.699> the<00:06:34.969> stall<00:06:35.270> I<00:06:35.629> didn't

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
didn't approach the stall I didn't

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.740 
didn't approach the stall I didn't
actually<00:06:36.259> stall<00:06:36.800> it<00:06:37.210> until<00:06:38.210> I<00:06:38.240> kind<00:06:38.449> of<00:06:38.569> got<00:06:38.719> a

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
actually stall it until I kind of got a

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.029 
actually stall it until I kind of got a
little<00:06:38.840> more<00:06:39.050> familiar<00:06:39.349> with<00:06:39.740> it<00:06:39.860> get<00:06:40.009> a

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
little more familiar with it get a

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.779 
little more familiar with it get a
little<00:06:40.159> more<00:06:40.370> altitude<00:06:40.520> and<00:06:42.430> but<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.550> lands

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
little more altitude and but it lands

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.059 
little more altitude and but it lands
very<00:06:43.969> softly<00:06:44.210> on<00:06:44.870> the<00:06:44.930> ground<00:06:45.080> what<00:06:45.680> happens

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
very softly on the ground what happens

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.830 
very softly on the ground what happens
is<00:06:46.219> when<00:06:46.400> the<00:06:46.490> gears<00:06:46.759> all<00:06:47.000> the<00:06:47.090> way<00:06:47.240> up<00:06:47.419> there's

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
is when the gears all the way up there's

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.709 
is when the gears all the way up there's
some<00:06:48.020> big<00:06:48.520> coiled<00:06:49.520> Springs<00:06:50.060> that<00:06:50.300> actually

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
some big coiled Springs that actually

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.899 
some big coiled Springs that actually
take<00:06:50.960> the<00:06:51.199> shock<00:06:51.439> of<00:06:51.469> the<00:06:51.800> airplane<00:06:52.099> taxing

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909 
take the shock of the airplane taxing

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.600 
take the shock of the airplane taxing
across<00:06:53.240> like<00:06:53.479> a<00:06:53.509> turf<00:06:53.780> runway<00:06:54.199> like<00:06:54.409> mine<00:06:54.680> but

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
across like a turf runway like mine but

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.920 
across like a turf runway like mine but
once<00:06:55.789> you<00:06:55.909> come<00:06:56.330> into<00:06:56.479> land
