00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 hi hi hi how are you good at video 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.230
 today we have one more tag that is 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.940
 Do not lie people, but follow this one. 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.429
 video has claimed that I have only done 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.590
 tag because it's teen fun 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.570
 I think it's really cool to tag though 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 be a fashion blogger thing she 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.539
 find out something that is a fun 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.189
 another fell only when many millionaires 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.060
 which is something that I would also like 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.800
 to stay 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.330
 It's okay that no one is sending in a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 beauty product for me because I 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 could ruin the product or be 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 boy propaganda of them our way too 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 There's a lot of noise 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.640
 It's a fucking rain I went back to then 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 was saying no brand will want 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.079
 me to sponsor things of beauty because 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 I'm not a person who has so much 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.489
 Beauty , and I'll do something 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 I do not have much hair 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.629
 so well if any mark of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 have it shampoo anti fall could me 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.920
 participate sponsor me the problem that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.270
 if it does not work the product will stay in the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 face that is not working 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
 unless they pay the implant to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.510
 me that I do not know if I wanted to make a 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.920
 implant in the hair in two the hair stays 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.480
 looking like a doll knows that everything 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 so it looks like they used the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 sewing machine to put in your 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 hair and I also heard that you take 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.350
 from the back of the head to put 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.659
 here then if I had to put 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 This part here the day also carries well 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.740
 Look, I had taken the back and 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.810
 going bald at the back though 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.759
 are making these modern cut where the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 I wrote everything here and I could do more 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.430
 type here and nobody even 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.140
 to repair 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.090
 I do not use much beauty products and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.009
 nor anything of the kind a powder to put 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.049
 in my hair he lets off a little 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.329
 more armed so if I do not use this 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.130
 business my hair gets the size 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.520
 shape of my head because I am 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.409
 bald, and one made a fool of himself 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 not that I do not get after the yahoo 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.720
 my hair but at least it helps the people 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.479
 talking about idiots that I'm sleepwalking 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.040
 It's really just me, I woke up this morning. 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.780
 make my breakfast that actually 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.479
 was soda 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.969
 I noticed I had a chocolate pizza in 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.490
 On top of the table, I was reminded of the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.829
 Moments in that scheme if you drink 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.229
 do not marry and I remembered that I woke up 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.360
 dawn no one to the brandi pizzeria 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.459
 ordered the own dog i called the pizza 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.220
 arrived I went down to get the pizza with 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.930
 my the piece of pizza 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.700
 some rice to sleep again and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.130
 just woke up i do not remember anything 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.500
 I have some flashes in the face. 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.660
 my head and if she was going to wake up and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.820
 buy a pizza that gets the pizza 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.380
 everything else is an important thing 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.390
 enough for you to remember then 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.100
 if I did it in the module whatever the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.020
 module 1 bi may be what I have done 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.490
 several other things I do not remember 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.050
 wake up in the morning and saw that your body 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.860
 I was much messier than you 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.960
 imagined 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.120
 you already awoke in the morning assets under 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.590
 in the morning he noticed that you brush the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.600
 teeth at some point sometimes wake up 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.280
 in the morning and I see that my towel is 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.660
 played on the floor and wet I do not remember 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.490
 taking a shower although this is a 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.340
 Good thing, I have a problem. 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.500
 sleepwalking I'm a somnambulist who has 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.020
 in personnel because the bodies inside the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 bath with pizza could have her shit in the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.230
 middle of the room 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.990
 although it happened that I did not 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.390
 I already cut it placed in the middle of the room but I 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.950
 I think it was the squid had nothing to 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.730
 to see with sleepwalking we got the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:14.810
 Bus was missing the hello 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:17.600
 she's the breaks she so even 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.530
 her normal breathing is barely passing 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.680
 or anything 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.190
 she's just a little excited to 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.190
 to play it 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.470
 there is no good so you have some type 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.959
 of somnambulism tells me there in our 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.220
 comments section you kind do what 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.709
 during the night when you are 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.390
 awake to shantha asleep or asleep 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.400
 I think you're awake in your concept 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.680
 right, he's seeing a lot of noise 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.920
 out here is the noise of children being 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.420
 searched for by plane mothers, I do not 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.980
 I know if nobody comes to get the child 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.260
 helicopter but it was going to be very crazy 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.269
 When I was a child, I did not have much 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.030
 and there was an echo study in a 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.670
 private school that had this boy 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.110
 that his name but we finally thought 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.760
 that he was richer than the others 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.140
 yes I actually had a little more 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.459
 money but the college where I was studying 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.440
 in a high school where there were people 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.420
 millionaire is better had no contact 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.670
 none with anyone who was very rich 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.160
 but I remember that once we arrived 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.080
 and played a song in the middle of the room and 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.060
 6 him that he had a business playing 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.150
 music 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.669
 the animals with a sound and our face to 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.530
 me I was absolutely sure he is 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.940
 the mother of Ferrari's arrival get him 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.800
 that I have never seen him being sought in the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.810
 school and a concept of being rich is 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.720
 lady or even me who had not 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.480
 car that illusion is a ferrari by 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.610
 difficult times there will but then I 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.530
 had rumors that if this boy he 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.510
 also had a helicopter and things 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.550
 gender is had an eye on school had 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.040
 seven years old but there are already rumors caa 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.860
 and also a throw in pencil school 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.020
 no neon colored pencils 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.600
 so that's why you had a 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.310
 box with 24 of those is what I told you 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.780
 has a ferrari it was better that you have 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.190
 I would drive it because we knew how to drive. 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.479
 anyway it's actually still 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.040
 better you are ferrari me 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.570
 because I can not drive to this day I 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.160
 I worked with art so I can do 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.470
 something much better than hitting 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.180
 a ferrari with neon colored pencils 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.370
 You had to choose one to send. 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.020
 My dear, I do not know how to do it but then it's 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.580
 coming back to the subject when they are 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.440
 Seeking the kids here does a lot. 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.470
 and a woman she stays with 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.430
 making a call from 1984, you know. 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.710
 speaking the name of all the children 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.300
 practice know that is coming out that is 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.610
 entering to participate apparently 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.950
 It's like a concentration camp where the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.620
 1 38 point he gets here has a 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.720
 horn of the original tarzan's noise 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.090
 You know and for some reason I have a lot. 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.010
 fear of this noise the noise of tarzan is 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.100
 It was a bizarre business and I was 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.960
 a track about the movie that the actor there 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.310
 He invented this noise, said Clinton. 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.810
 that they needed something that was 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.660
 Stadium gives public to call the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.120
 animals is a hero, that's what this is 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.760
 It seems like a mixture of screaming noise. 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.039
 himself with the helena something like that 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.870
 although of another animal but no one 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.270
 But you can repeat that sound 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.789
 face makes believe original it already does 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.560
 him a point the fans won the Oscar 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.960
 to win an Oscar for the role that was 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.180
 fuck that support but it scares me and I do not 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.820
 I like this guy, there are several who give me 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.669
 fear an unconscious fear I do not know why 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:20.500
 there is also that noise of the 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:22.810
 The key of the keys nor chapolin 2011 was 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.580
 This noise gives me shivers until 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.529
 I do not know why today and I remember too 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.149
 in the same 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.949
 the rich kid I remember my cousin 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:30.749
 had an ax 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.849
 so a toy cartoon of 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:34.859
 rubber is obviously you beat on 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.719
 others screamed like a scream 

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:38.969
 of pain and suffering in the morning the cast 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.889
 he made this nest I started to cry and 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:42.809
 It was not worse because it hurt the 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.929
 I started to cry because the sound was 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:47.849
 so terrifying so sad 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:49.619
 I started to cry, it's a child of mine. 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.809
 sensitive person found only very sensitive person 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:53.819
 I still do not cry while the 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:55.829
 nightly arrangement with pizza is fine 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.549
 best key league of the competition 

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:58.549
 I'm not crying
