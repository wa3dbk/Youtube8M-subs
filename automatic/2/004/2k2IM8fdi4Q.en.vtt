00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.370
 new video today I show you as you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.539
 could record the ps4 over hdmi 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.199
 because the problem is the playstation 4 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.869
 just like the playstation 3 has a yes 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 an encrypted hdmi signal namely 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 a hdcp encrypted signal and that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.570
 ensures that they basically not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.579
 So I can record here now 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 for example, the cover media 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.430
 live gamer portable connected 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.960
 Nice capture that works 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.059
 basically as well as the el gato 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:53.750
 capture hd that means hdmi goes in here 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.160
 is recorded on pc 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.530
 USB connection and here comes the signal 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.350
 out again so monitor or 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.920
 TV and if I just now in the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.439
 software go in and here I have 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 ever see my screen and then say 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.060
 I want to record 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.060
 then comes the recording failed 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 content is copy protected 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.049
 and in this case the device flashes 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 that is, it is just a mistake 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.590
 and it is easy to blame 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.590
 the hdcp copy protection 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.490
 So what is to be done 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.689
 there is a very simple solution there 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.040
 you only need a few euros for it 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:40.140
 invest and that's just a hdmi 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:44.399
 splatter with this hdmi splitter one 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.960
 two you share the shares signal the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:54.119
 from a hdmi signal to two hdmi 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.790
 signals and the joke is that the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.450
 apparently the hdcp copy protection easy 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.670
 eliminated and here I show you now 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.130
 the same as the one connecting the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.430
 is actually quite simple at first 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.179
 times 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.440
 I hold the ps4 times I like that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.340
 namely not if I have cable 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.990
 switch and the devices will run there 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.930
 It can be very fast problems 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:26.590
 give it then in the reason I still have 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.630
 an extra hdmi cable a whole 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.310
 short but that's enough and it 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.900
 it's just so we sew we go from the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 ps4 out and go in the hdmi splitter 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.520
 ride on the hdmi input logical what 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.640
 is also important 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.170
 the hdmi splitter needs its own 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.810
 electricity connection has its own 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.660
 power supply while he closes it simply 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.320
 and he lights up already clear red 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.830
 so that the power is there so that is 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.830
 only one 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:16.299
 number two yes we go with one of the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.299
 Exits easy to prove in the camp 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:28.069
 that's the reason you 're already there 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.829
 finished because you are now practically 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.590
 form of the ps4 in the hdmi splitter 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.950
 then please get out of the hades again 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.239
 your capture device and you are already 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.540
 actually receptive and that will 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.859
 I'll be right now because I'll be the same 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.459
 to put it to the test 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:52.449
 you turn on the ps4 again and 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.449
 of course, the controller 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.750
 Of course, that needs something 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:04.969
 little relationship drives so it comes 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.859
 ever see a picture I just in 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:12.769
 at least the cityscape expect now 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:17.750
 just a little bit started up is good and 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:21.680
 we have the main menu again and then 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.979
 Let's click on the recordings button and 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.979
 voila 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:33.430
 it is recorded here on the 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:35.900
 Shooting button which is nice flashes and 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.940
 I'll show you that right now 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.430
 not only in the main menu works 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.270
 but really in the game and I stop 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.460
 now release the recording again and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.639
 stared times now in the case assassin's 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.150
 creed 4 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.770
 and now, in addition to the game, the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.460
 running game and I press on the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:03.530
 Recordings button and it runs and off 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.630
 Immediately you can behead and in 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:11.010
 most beautiful 10 80 p 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.410
 and what are we doing and you have that 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:19.890
 actually hdcp leveraged and can 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:22.380
 record normally what I still too 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:28.080
 the device wanted to say moments 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:31.190
 We will stop recording here, too 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.690
 but that is media live gamer portable 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.400
 you can record a full 10 80 p 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.430
 no problem at all a super 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.070
 quite honest and alternative to elgato 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.750
 as I said the hdmi splitter that's there 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.880
 Among others, at Amazon, the links to 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.420
 the products to the two you will find 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.800
 below in the description and to 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.490
 graduation maybe a whole 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.380
 Small note that I like to do her 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.330
 have a hdmi splitter and I close 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.580
 my control monitor where I still 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.060
 just play on the hdmi splitter 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.240
 that has the advantage that I too 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.750
 can gamble without the device to use 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.140
 have to 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.650
 So if I say that in the reason 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.290
 the pc is off and thus the device say 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.210
 I is not running times as the device can 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.840
 you still gamble because we stop that 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.170
 Splitter distributes the signal from the 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.940
 ps4 just on the capture card 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.400
 which we might not need 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.630
 and just on your monitor or yours 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.080
 TV that means he actually has 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.630
 a pretty good setup where you do not have much 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.630
 Chrome screw is in this afterwards 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.190
 thank you for your attention 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.140
 I hope you have a little bit 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.850
 helped 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.690
 when asked clearly this simply writes in 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.539
 the comments 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.759
 and do not forget to subscribe 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.360
 then you do not miss any episode at 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.669
 next time 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.669
 and otherwise have fun playing
