 that in each of the interviews helped 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:48.600
 a lot to the contacts years that I have 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.550
 six that passes from the first the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.470
 first media mines in this country 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.789
 I was one of the first that seemed 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.789
 silent cinema every other time 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 there is the voice to the rock not to the novice 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.580
 little nobody looks at labrune guy when not 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.440
 you spend t 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.409
 no no no but he started me in sight 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.239
 in the middle but when there was no 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.170
 term not even mediatic that was passing 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.020
 first it was 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.489
 the graph starts to start 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.980
 invite me to TV shows that 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.170
 right away I was famous they could not believe the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.170
 things he said then there was no 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.530
 retransmissions 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.290
 what you said Argentina country of 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.140
 cabotage was a cover for example I did 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.620
 this year of 79 80 and it was a cap or the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.620
 touch and go 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.950
 that is, the things that I have said have been 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.950
 tapas 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.330
 naturally because I think that is 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.040
 it must because I am a great reader then 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.200
 there is a great enrichment in the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.660
 vocabulary and there's a different way 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.069
 I read a lot of philosophy then it assumes a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.640
 different way of saying things that 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.640
 reading 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.650
 I do not give him more the distance is a 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.360
 carefree but productive keen 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.640
 for psychology and philosophy and the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 thought that means exactly 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.720
 where I give to fly
