00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
allow blades now with this photograph we

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.259 
allow blades now with this photograph we
didn't<00:02:07.159> have<00:02:07.280> played<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.759> what<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:08.090> see

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
didn't have played and what you can see

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.630 
didn't have played and what you can see
are<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.750> deployed<00:02:09.440> borders<00:02:09.979> around<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.519> edge

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
are the deployed borders around the edge

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.240 
are the deployed borders around the edge
now<00:02:11.269> if<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.840> look<00:02:11.959> at<00:02:12.049> this<00:02:12.110> photograph<00:02:12.379> it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
now if you look at this photograph it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.180 
now if you look at this photograph it
was<00:02:13.430> big<00:02:13.640> enough<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.900> for<00:02:15.650> example<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
was big enough and and for example the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.830 
was big enough and and for example the
tree<00:02:16.489> is<00:02:16.610> right<00:02:16.790> at<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.150> edge<00:02:17.269> here<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:17.569> we

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
tree is right at the edge here so we

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.059 
tree is right at the edge here so we
couldn't<00:02:18.080> stretch<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.560> off<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.799> edge<00:02:18.890> but

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
couldn't stretch it off the edge but

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.650 
couldn't stretch it off the edge but
this<00:02:19.220> photograph<00:02:19.670> allowed<00:02:20.060> us<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.269> wrap<00:02:20.540> it

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
this photograph allowed us to wrap it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.170 
this photograph allowed us to wrap it
around<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.769> gives<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.190> nice<00:02:22.310> touch<00:02:22.580> so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
around but that gives it a nice touch so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.850 
around but that gives it a nice touch so
if<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.540> add<00:02:23.629> it<00:02:23.780> if<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:24.440> can<00:02:24.560> add<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> bit

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
if you can add it if you can add a bit

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.259 
if you can add it if you can add a bit
of<00:02:24.890> bleed<00:02:25.129> into<00:02:25.430> into<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> print<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.150> will

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
of bleed into into the print it will

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.360 
of bleed into into the print it will
really<00:02:26.450> help<00:02:26.660> also<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.650> other<00:02:27.799> thing<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.160> I've
