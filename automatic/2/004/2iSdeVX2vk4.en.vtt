00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
that the brain reacts less to impulses

that the brain reacts less to impulses

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
coming from the hand than before so what

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
coming from the hand than before so what
it<00:01:48.060> means<00:01:48.090> essentially<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> small

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it means essentially that a small

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030 
it means essentially that a small
