00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.580 
of more spider webs let's move along to
the<00:03:47.350> pastry<00:03:48.100> holder<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.910> spider<00:03:49.390> webs<00:03:49.660> more

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
the pastry holder so spider webs more

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.310 
the pastry holder so spider webs more
spider<00:03:50.890> webs<00:03:51.160> more<00:03:51.700> spider<00:03:51.940> webs<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.989> this<00:03:53.140> is

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
spider webs more spider webs but this is

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.290 
spider webs more spider webs but this is
what<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.500> use<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.800> display<00:03:54.160> all<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.700> cakes<00:03:55.000> it

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
what I use to display all the cakes it

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.170 
what I use to display all the cakes it
does<00:03:55.540> go<00:03:55.720> back<00:03:55.900> pretty<00:03:56.230> far<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.400> make<00:03:57.880> sure<00:03:57.910> not

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
does go back pretty far so make sure not

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.640 
does go back pretty far so make sure not
to<00:03:58.239> get<00:03:58.390> anything<00:03:58.720> jammed<00:03:59.170> back<00:03:59.440> there

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
to get anything jammed back there

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.420 
to get anything jammed back there
because<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.280> would<00:04:00.790> bite<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.890> all

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
because that would bite so that is all

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.120 
because that would bite so that is all
of<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:04.060> loose<00:04:04.540> accessories<00:04:05.410> let's<00:04:05.800> go<00:04:06.010> ahead

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
of the loose accessories let's go ahead

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.610 
of the loose accessories let's go ahead
and<00:04:06.280> move<00:04:06.640> on<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.540> big<00:04:07.810> stuff<00:04:08.080> like<00:04:08.410> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
and move on to the big stuff like the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.550 
and move on to the big stuff like the
cart<00:04:09.150> since<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.330> cart<00:04:10.570> has<00:04:10.780> so<00:04:10.959> much<00:04:11.080> detail

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560
