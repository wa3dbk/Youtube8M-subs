00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
multiplayer that'd be really fun that

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.860 
multiplayer that'd be really fun that
would<00:04:21.130> really<00:04:21.280> complete<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.910> game<00:04:22.090> here<00:04:22.750> we

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
would really complete the game here we

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.510 
would really complete the game here we
out<00:04:22.990> we<00:04:23.350> have<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.650> Thunder<00:04:23.980> all<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> way<00:04:24.400> up

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
out we have the Thunder all the way up

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.690 
out we have the Thunder all the way up
so<00:04:24.700> we<00:04:24.760> can<00:04:24.880> use<00:04:25.030> our<00:04:25.180> power<00:04:25.450> up<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.550> will

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
so we can use our power up and that will

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.380 
so we can use our power up and that will
hurt<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.120> more<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.450> course<00:04:29.910> but<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.180> very

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
hurt you more of course but it's a very

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.240 
hurt you more of course but it's a very
simple<00:04:31.570> game<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.080> very<00:04:32.260> easy<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.680> understand

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
simple game it's very easy to understand

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.330 
simple game it's very easy to understand

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
it doesn't include any instructions or

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.790 
it doesn't include any instructions or
anything<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:38.020> got<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.290> kind<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.530> teach

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
anything so you got to kind of teach

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.490 
anything so you got to kind of teach
yourself<00:04:39.250> what<00:04:39.400> you're<00:04:39.520> supposed<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:39.910> do<00:04:40.500> but

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
yeah it has a lot of potential they

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.110 
yeah it has a lot of potential they
really<00:04:43.210> need<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.450> update<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:44.080> lot<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.440> things

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
really need to update a lot of things

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.050

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
maybe with the menu and me the overall

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.550 
maybe with the menu and me the overall
experience<00:04:49.919> runner<00:04:50.919> not<00:04:51.310> so<00:04:51.550> repetitive

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.920
