00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.780
 hello everyone I'm next sea ​​today I 'm going 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.050
 to teach how to install the module to der 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.000
 the minecraft port and then how to install 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.030
 a good mod what we are going to do 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.270
 first is if you have some way 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.840
 installed follow the tutorial that I'm going 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.840
 to leave here 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.270
 and then what you have to do then is 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.240
 what I'm going to do now 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.100
 first press the windows key + r 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.260
 and between that app data 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.140
 then in the minecraft folder you enter and 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.809
 so I'm going to do it behind this 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.379
 direct access that is to not make you the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.670
 data of the app process then gives it 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:04.570
 we give xavi then the point minecraft you 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.729
 open with winrar and then open in 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 Moreover the module the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.090
 description 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.530
 then we delete the meta folder and that is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.250
 so that a black screen does not appear 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 every time you open the hosepipe now 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 we open the minecraft 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.649
 I have it like that because I have it 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.649
 original 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 I saw it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.990
 and then now we close again 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:51.200
 we open the rap of minecraft four 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.460
 and then we open the oven 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.460
 an option mein kampf 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.190
 and then we are all moving 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.640
 and now we open the stained again 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.440
 well now it 's 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.680
 setting up the forum very has to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.850
 download some things and now it's 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.220
 validating and now this moya will appear 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.569
 and this will appear and here you can see 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.190
 the mails that you have 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:45.530

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.380
 and now we close 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 let's go to the point minecraft and then the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.250
 folder amount 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.090
 and we see the instructions 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.370
 and then then when we win in 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.510
 this case I have to move that is 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.510
 we move it there 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.270
 and we open our hands for the last time 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.580
 It's not what I love 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.430
 every time it appears that is that it is 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.260
 checking the fort that the installation and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.810
 what are you seeing then then we go 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.940
 to motorcycles and you can see that the mode is 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.870
 go that is the one of the trampolines 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.860

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.520
 installation is fine and we can use 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.500
 perfectly the minecraft good to me 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.450

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.970
 recording with singing but with the traps 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.300

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.300

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.129
