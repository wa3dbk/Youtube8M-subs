 political parties that work together

 by Ecuador but removed from the list the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.230
 who considers that they conspire against their 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 administration 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.540

 during this campaign an isolated event does not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.940
 related to the political struggle of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 Ecuador was a tragedy I mean 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.710

 after acknowledging his defeat he claimed that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.110
