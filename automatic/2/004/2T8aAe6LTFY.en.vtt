00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
just put this guy next to him I like how

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.730 
just put this guy next to him I like how
I<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> proportions<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.140> think

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I like how the proportions are I think

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
I like how the proportions are I think
this<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> proportions<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
this is the proportions but you know I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.160 
this is the proportions but you know I
remember<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.240> Valkyrie<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.630> fighting<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
remember the Valkyrie is fighting the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
remember the Valkyrie is fighting the
zentradi<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.220> they're<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> same<00:01:50.970> size

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
zentradi and they're about the same size

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.350 
zentradi and they're about the same size
so<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> don't<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.950> trotty<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:54.240> were

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so I don't think as in trotty if he were

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300 
so I don't think as in trotty if he were
the<00:01:54.390> size<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.840> Valkyrie<00:01:55.140> could<00:01:55.770> fit<00:01:56.040> into

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the size of that Valkyrie could fit into

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.580 
the size of that Valkyrie could fit into
this<00:01:56.939> battle<00:01:57.630> pod

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
this battle pod

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.300 
this battle pod
