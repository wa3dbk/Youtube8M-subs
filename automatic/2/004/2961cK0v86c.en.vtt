00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and this is really important because a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.889 
and this is really important because a

help to do that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.520 
help to do that
so<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.629> need<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so you need to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.770 
so you need to
