00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
in a few few months or few weeks so I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.480 
in a few few months or few weeks so I
thought<00:00:21.510> I'd<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> cover<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.490> first

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
thought I'd have to cover it and first

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.359 
thought I'd have to cover it and first
of<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.789> there's<00:00:24.269> strange<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.619> panda

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369

thing with bunny is on the ledge there

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
thing with bunny is on the ledge there
then<00:00:31.679> let's<00:00:31.890> say<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
then let's say about that because I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.729 
then let's say about that because I
don't<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> year<00:00:34.140> then

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
don't know what it is for a year then

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.979 
don't know what it is for a year then

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you go a like a crystal III i'm guessing

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.690 
you go a like a crystal III i'm guessing
the<00:00:37.200> toiletries<00:00:37.860> will<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.219> unique<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
planets would be pretty cool to set the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.229 
planets would be pretty cool to set the
vibe<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> planet<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:41.700> Irene<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this this screenshot seem to be

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
this this screenshot seem to be
multiplayer<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.780> got<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.070> character

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
it seems that they have actual stairs so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
it seems that they have actual stairs so

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you don't keep jumping like a retard so

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.090 
you don't keep jumping like a retard so
that's<00:01:50.520> always<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:50.850> feature<00:01:51.979> where<00:01:52.979> else

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that's always a good feature where else

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's always a good feature where else
is<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.490> there's<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.180> I've<00:01:54.299> noticed

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

of the screen shot which are probably a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.679 
of the screen shot which are probably a
lot<00:01:59.939> people<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.360> haven't<00:02:00.570> noticed

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
