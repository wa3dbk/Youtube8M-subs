00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.900
 is what essentially distinguishes these 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.520
 these different styles are so 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.350
 clear we are not happy and that I believe 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.010
 it is important to know that at the time 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.239
 there was touching only the almost 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.970
 only the music of his own time 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:23.300
 then everything was contemporary music 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.560
 in mozart's time it was almost 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.479
 never from bach or vivaldi or when 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.170
 I played on him 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.830
 thus an arrangement was made for the taste of the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.040
 weather 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.160
 putting clarinet are instruments 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.160
 new 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.500
 that's important to know because it takes a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.520
 sort of very clear direction very 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.770
 strong of the cajacas style each 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.489
 time at the same time for the reason 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.150
 that there was no possibility of listening 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.270
 many many different schools each 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.360
 city â€‹â€‹of italy had its own 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.009
 orchestra own that style of playing your 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.590
 own fingerboard and I was the thing was 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.710
 very very 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.860
 geographical very very strong in your space 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.470
 very 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.370
 delimited and very 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.040
 with a lot of personality among geminiani 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.950
 and b locatelli running and all these 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.490
 great teachers but probably 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.290
 there were differences in style technique 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.080
 very big 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.540
 and that is important because we 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.030
 we live in a time where the trend 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.820
 is 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.740
 globalization is to listen to all the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 same sound in new york in the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.140
 orchestras for example the fact that 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.310
 instruments like the oboe well come that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.860
 or the French bassoon disappears is why 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.069
 a director travels a lot and wants 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.739
 listen all around the globe the 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.080
 same sound that you know and this is this 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.180
 kind of things in the baroque does not exist 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.540
 had to adapt to each situation 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.120
 [Music] 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.110
 you have to take into account this 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.480
 technically it is interesting for example 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.959
 see that with the cello an instrument 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.620
 very poor at the beginning because it was the 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.349
 bass guitar instrument h 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.110
 Fantastic golf free learning 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.019
 stradivari where people played in 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.920
 first position almost not then the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.980
 quality of the bunk was by the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.790
 sound the richness of the sound more than 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.900
 the electro earthquake 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:09.150
 but interesting to see for example what 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.819
 in the baroque era in france a 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.440
 a cello treatise for example disc 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.160
 get 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.340
 one of the few places we know says 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.190
 the first finger after the second finger 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.190
 for a tone and the quarter for half tone 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.069
 and that's the first time that 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.609
 I've read it I thought it's not a mistake 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.769
 was wrong with the numbers can not be 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:44.280
 a tone with a finger in half tone with 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.980
 two but then I thought at the time the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.469
 people who play the cello were the 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.430
 violinists then played violin like this 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:56.770
 and they played cello like that and when you have the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.889
 hand with this position you can not 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.889
 [Music] 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.170
 then 1 2 4 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:14.110
 it's very much planned rich for us of course 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:17.590
 but it's logical if after type 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.410
 30 to 50 years later says there is no need 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.880
 think the position of the hand as the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.700
 old masters of prawn viola 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:31.020
 then much more round open without 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.310
 I will close the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.280
 forming the colon 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.009
 and open with the instruments always the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:45.210
 away from the body you never have to press 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:49.949
 and open your hand with the problem of 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:54.480
 that allows you to do extensions and change 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:58.820
 position and go up without 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:04.400
 and without closing then comes the the 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.400
 cellist complex that comes from this 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.520
 who wants to imitate the violin because the 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.009
 instrument that imitated the violin was the 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.659
 viola da pramba 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:20.849
 the three sonatas of many all this the 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:23.960
 cello did not do pum pum 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:29.569
 then people like 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.930
 boccherini this all these people that 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:35.960
 He started to say but you can go up and 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.630
 imitate the violin and do much more 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.150
 more than what we do now 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.550
 then the violin can have four 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.930
 fingers 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.539
 [Music] 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.530
 and the cello with the thumb with the capot 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.530
 up to 5 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.690
 then better than the violin man 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.290
 we have overcome the violinists and that was 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.590
 naturally the whole time of 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.310
 classicism is all up in the the 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.620
 deep color snow 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.620
 to demonstrate this this technique 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.010
 and the 19th century brings other things with 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.820
 robert 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.520
 the possibility of doing with a bow the 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.200
 same thing to the heel that 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.970
 the tip because that's a bow 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.970
 of 18 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:39.960
 and completely different from an arch 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:44.399
 concave that comes after then there 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:51.319
 you can see that the trip is multiplied by 10 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:51.319
 in huge measures of phrasing to
