00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300 
don't really know if it's gonna make its
money<00:03:06.930> back<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.620> think<00:03:07.829> the<00:03:07.890> reason<00:03:08.190> for

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
money back and I think the reason for

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400 
money back and I think the reason for
that<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.549> because<00:03:08.579> Taylor<00:03:09.120> Kitsch<00:03:09.329> has<00:03:09.989> kind

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that is because Taylor Kitsch has kind

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.430 
that is because Taylor Kitsch has kind
of<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> not<00:03:11.519> really<00:03:11.790> star<00:03:12.299> quality<00:03:12.750> status<00:03:13.260> at

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
of a not really star quality status at

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.740 
of a not really star quality status at
this<00:03:13.620> point<00:03:13.980> yet<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:14.940> battleship

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
this point yet but I think battleship

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.170 
this point yet but I think battleship
will<00:03:16.079> be<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.440> movie<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.190> bring<00:03:17.700> them<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.150> that

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
will be that movie to bring them to that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.569 
will be that movie to bring them to that
point<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.170> fact<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.530> they<00:03:19.739> said<00:03:19.980> for

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
point and the fact that they said for

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.960 
point and the fact that they said for
the<00:03:20.730> creators<00:03:21.299> of<00:03:21.350> transformers<00:03:22.400> or<00:03:23.400> from<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
the creators of transformers or from the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940 
the creators of transformers or from the
