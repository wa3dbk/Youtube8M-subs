this one like I said a strip wall
insulated<00:00:58.800> canvas<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.399> there's<00:00:59.550> no<00:00:59.640> air<00:00:59.879> foam

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> middle<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.719> there

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
in the middle right there

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.520 
in the middle right there
you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.829> maybe<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:02.609> thick<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
you can maybe see how thick it is and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the difference from the video earlier as

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.969 
the difference from the video earlier as
the<00:01:50.430> sun's<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.970> down<00:01:51.590> with<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> windows

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:11.950 

Elizabeth<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.400> windows<00:01:59.670> open

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.750 

this<00:02:12.960> does<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.350> latches<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.100> outside<00:02:14.520> we

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
this does have latches on the outside we

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.570 
this does have latches on the outside we
had<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.630> low-profile<00:02:16.230> top

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
had to do that for the low-profile top

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.460 
had to do that for the low-profile top
it's<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> only<00:02:17.820> top<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.240> gets<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.600> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
it's the only top that gets that it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.980 
it's the only top that gets that it
would<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:20.060> shrunk<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> bed<00:02:21.360> down<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.840> we

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
would have shrunk the bed down have we

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.250 
would have shrunk the bed down have we
had<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.830> put<00:02:22.980> them<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.250> inside<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.600> they

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
had to put them on the inside so they

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.020 
had to put them on the inside so they
keep<00:02:25.440> our<00:02:25.620> bed<00:02:25.830> large<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:26.790> them<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
keep our bed large we put them on the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.250 
keep our bed large we put them on the
outside<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.640> bed<00:02:33.260> opened

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
outside so this is what the bed opened

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.090 
outside so this is what the bed opened
all<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> way<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:35.390> its<00:02:36.590> I'm<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.800> sure<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
all the way up its I'm not sure what the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.500 
all the way up its I'm not sure what the
measurements<00:02:38.520> are<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.030> probably

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
