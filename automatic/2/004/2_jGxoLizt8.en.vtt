00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.219 
definitely do that and as much of a pain
as<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.919> is<00:04:37.069> you<00:04:37.699> do<00:04:37.849> need<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.120> drive<00:04:38.419> them<00:04:38.659> in

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
as it is you do need to drive them in

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.200 
as it is you do need to drive them in
the<00:04:39.319> beginning<00:04:39.469> so<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> beginning<00:04:40.819> they

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the beginning so in the beginning they

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.760 
the beginning so in the beginning they
would<00:04:41.449> basically<00:04:41.749> I<00:04:41.960> supply<00:04:42.379> them<00:04:42.560> with<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
would basically I supply them with the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.950 
would basically I supply them with the
maps<00:04:42.979> that<00:04:43.219> I<00:04:43.249> want<00:04:43.490> them<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.610> go<00:04:43.789> to<00:04:43.819> and<00:04:44.240> every

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
maps that I want them to go to and every

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.269 
maps that I want them to go to and every
day<00:04:45.139> when<00:04:45.349> they're<00:04:45.499> done<00:04:45.770> they<00:04:45.830> have<00:04:46.189> to

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279 
day when they're done they have to

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.279 
day when they're done they have to
report<00:04:46.669> back<00:04:46.909> to<00:04:46.969> me<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.719> know<00:04:47.810> hey<00:04:47.960> we<00:04:48.139> hit

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
report back to me you know hey we hit

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.679 
report back to me you know hey we hit
this<00:04:48.499> subdivision<00:04:48.740> or<00:04:49.279> this<00:04:49.669> area<00:04:50.060> was<00:04:50.240> warped

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689 
this subdivision or this area was warped

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.809 
this subdivision or this area was warped
so<00:04:51.259> I<00:04:51.319> know<00:04:51.379> exactly<00:04:51.560> where<00:04:52.039> they<00:04:52.189> were<00:04:52.249> I<00:04:52.430> can

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
so I know exactly where they were I can

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.029 
so I know exactly where they were I can
drive<00:04:53.060> up<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.389> down<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:54.080> street<00:04:54.409> you<00:04:54.830> know<00:04:54.919> to

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
drive up and down the street you know to

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.019 
drive up and down the street you know to
make<00:04:55.159> sure<00:04:55.279> that<00:04:55.400> they're<00:04:55.580> actually<00:04:55.699> hanging

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.029 
make sure that they're actually hanging

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.790 
make sure that they're actually hanging
on<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.300> doors<00:04:56.569> so<00:04:57.259> we<00:04:57.349> did<00:04:57.499> that<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.770> first

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
on the doors so we did that the first

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.920 
on the doors so we did that the first
few<00:04:58.249> drops<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.849> then<00:04:58.999> after<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.449> we<00:04:59.689> you

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
few drops and then after that we you

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.050 
few drops and then after that we you
know<00:04:59.960> we<00:05:00.169> built<00:05:00.560> up<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:00.949> relationship<00:05:01.909> where

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
know we built up that relationship where

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.640 
know we built up that relationship where
we<00:05:02.150> trust<00:05:02.449> and<00:05:02.659> we<00:05:02.750> know<00:05:02.900> we're<00:05:03.199> confident

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
we trust and we know we're confident

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.140 
we trust and we know we're confident
they're<00:05:03.740> getting<00:05:04.039> out<00:05:04.159> there<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.939> of<00:05:05.120> course

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
they're getting out there and of course

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.110 
they're getting out there and of course
the<00:05:05.539> return<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.259> know<00:05:06.409> I<00:05:06.439> mean<00:05:06.740> if<00:05:06.860> we've<00:05:07.129> well

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
the return you know I mean if we've well

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.629 
the return you know I mean if we've well
if<00:05:08.210> we<00:05:08.569> get<00:05:08.810> zero<00:05:09.139> calls<00:05:09.439> after<00:05:09.830> doing<00:05:10.009> 10,000

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
if we get zero calls after doing 10,000

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.119 
if we get zero calls after doing 10,000
we<00:05:10.699> know<00:05:10.849> something<00:05:11.330> something<00:05:11.689> weird<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.919> up

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
we know something something weird is up

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.790 
we know something something weird is up
when<00:05:13.310> we<00:05:13.430> normally<00:05:13.759> get<00:05:13.879> about<00:05:14.090> 15<00:05:14.539> calls<00:05:14.800> so

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
when we normally get about 15 calls so

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.619 
when we normally get about 15 calls so
if<00:05:16.009> you<00:05:16.129> put<00:05:16.310> up<00:05:16.430> 10,000<00:05:17.180> you're<00:05:17.330> receiving

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
if you put up 10,000 you're receiving

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.050 
if you put up 10,000 you're receiving
about<00:05:17.960> 15<00:05:18.439> calls<00:05:18.740> hey<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.669> know<00:05:19.879> in<00:05:19.969> the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
about 15 calls hey you know in the

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.059 
about 15 calls hey you know in the
beginning<00:05:20.419> that<00:05:20.839> was<00:05:20.960> true<00:05:21.259> I<00:05:21.289> mean<00:05:21.560> we<00:05:21.710> would

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
beginning that was true I mean we would

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.399 
beginning that was true I mean we would
and<00:05:22.610> more<00:05:23.210> calls<00:05:23.569> than<00:05:23.719> that<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.110> would

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
and more calls than that it would

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.529 
and more calls than that it would
actually<00:05:24.589> generate<00:05:24.949> to<00:05:25.219> about<00:05:25.370> 15<00:05:25.939> listings

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
actually generate to about 15 listings

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.450 
actually generate to about 15 listings
when<00:05:27.289> we<00:05:27.439> started<00:05:27.710> doing<00:05:27.949> this<00:05:28.039> about<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.279> year

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
when we started doing this about a year

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.790 
when we started doing this about a year
and<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.580> half<00:05:28.729> ago<00:05:28.879> a<00:05:29.240> date<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.169> it's<00:05:30.349> about<00:05:30.529> half

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
and a half ago a date so it's about half

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.350 
and a half ago a date so it's about half
that<00:05:31.039> where<00:05:31.250> were<00:05:31.490> we<00:05:31.879> actually<00:05:32.150> just

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
that where were we actually just

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.990 
that where were we actually just
completed<00:05:32.479> a<00:05:32.960> 10,000<00:05:33.860> drop<00:05:34.159> and<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:34.430> got<00:05:34.580> seven

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
completed a 10,000 drop and we got seven

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.389 
completed a 10,000 drop and we got seven
out<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.270> it
