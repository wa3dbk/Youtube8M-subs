00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
find a dense low-hanging evergreen

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
find a dense low-hanging evergreen
possibly<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.140> three<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.040> here

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
possibly two or three and right here

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
possibly two or three and right here
there's<00:01:35.640> three<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> triangle<00:01:36.780> I've

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
there's three of them to triangle I've

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
there's three of them to triangle I've
got<00:01:37.439> two<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.740> front<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.040> me<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.790> behind

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.359 
got two in front of me I have one behind
me<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> their<00:01:40.530> branches<00:01:40.979> create<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.670> like

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
me so their branches create this like

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
me so their branches create this like
this<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:45.079> wound<00:01:46.079> inside<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this little like wound inside here you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
this little like wound inside here you
know<00:01:47.159> any<00:01:47.310> mean<00:01:47.460> I'd<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.909> walls<00:01:48.210> around<00:01:48.600> me

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
know any mean I'd like walls around me

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.300 
know any mean I'd like walls around me
now<00:01:49.799> obviously<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.490> wanted<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> increase

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
now obviously if I wanted to increase

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.999 
now obviously if I wanted to increase
the<00:01:53.509> insulated<00:01:54.509> value<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> shelter<00:01:55.530> it'd

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the insulated value of the shelter it'd

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.929 
the insulated value of the shelter it'd
be<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.280> easy<00:01:56.600> all<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.880> go<00:01:59.880> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
be pretty easy all I would do is go to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.600 
be pretty easy all I would do is go to
the<00:02:00.149> evergreen<00:02:00.600> trees<00:02:00.930> around<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> case

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the evergreen trees around in this case

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.690 
the evergreen trees around in this case
its<00:02:02.820> eastern<00:02:03.119> white<00:02:03.270> pine<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
its eastern white pine and I would go to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.359 
its eastern white pine and I would go to
a<00:02:05.820> section<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.600> didn't<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.920> nice<00:02:08.129> little

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
a section that didn't have a nice little

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.490 
a section that didn't have a nice little
shelter<00:02:08.849> underneath<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.410> I'm

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
shelter underneath it like this so I'm

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
shelter underneath it like this so I'm
not<00:02:10.619> ruining<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.099> shelter<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:12.270> would<00:02:12.480> take

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
not ruining a shelter and I would take

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.000 
not ruining a shelter and I would take
and<00:02:12.930> break<00:02:13.170> off

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and break off

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.600 
and break off
some<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.489> branches<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:17.430> just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
some of the branches then I will just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.020 
some of the branches then I will just
lean<00:02:17.970> them<00:02:18.000> up<00:02:18.209> against<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.849> outside<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.940> my

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
lean them up against the outside of my

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.720 
lean them up against the outside of my
shelter<00:02:21.300> these<00:02:21.780> branches<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:23.489> lean<00:02:23.610> them

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
shelter these branches to lean them

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.089 
shelter these branches to lean them
right<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.360> make<00:02:24.510> walls<00:02:24.750> really<00:02:25.680> simple

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
right up and make walls really simple

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.910 
right up and make walls really simple
you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.730> I'm<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:27.599> going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> ruin<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.709> bunch

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you know I'm not going to ruin a bunch

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.710 
you know I'm not going to ruin a bunch
of<00:02:28.980> trees<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.000> break<00:02:30.209> off<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> bunch<00:02:30.630> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
of trees and break off a bunch of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.220 
of trees and break off a bunch of
branches<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.400> for<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.459> demonstration<00:02:33.230> but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
branches just for this demonstration but

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.660 
branches just for this demonstration but
I<00:02:34.290> mean<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.650> pretty<00:02:34.709> obvious<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.430> if

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
I mean it's pretty obvious you know if

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
I mean it's pretty obvious you know if
it's<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.880> little<00:02:36.030> windy<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.930> break<00:02:37.140> off<00:02:37.319> some

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
it's a little windy just break off some

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.080 
it's a little windy just break off some
branches<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.040> lean<00:02:38.250> them<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.430> against<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
branches and lean them up against the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.650 
branches and lean them up against the
other<00:02:39.390> branches<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.920> know<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.250> these<00:02:41.660> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
other branches you know like these that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.860 
other branches you know like these that
are<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:43.379> walls<00:02:43.709> right<00:02:44.040> now<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.910> create<00:02:45.390> more

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
are my walls right now to create more

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.839 
are my walls right now to create more
insulation<00:02:46.290> make<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.709> thicker<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.610> walls

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
insulation make it thicker on that walls

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.360 
insulation make it thicker on that walls
and<00:02:49.849> yeah<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:51.269> it's<00:02:51.569> pretty<00:02:51.870> uh<00:02:52.370> it's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and yeah you know it's pretty uh it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.850 
and yeah you know it's pretty uh it's
pretty<00:02:53.459> nice<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.900> bad<00:02:55.110> now<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> see<00:02:55.829> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
pretty nice in here not bad now I see a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.309 
pretty nice in here not bad now I see a

and I'll show you a few more that I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.410 
and I'll show you a few more that I
would<00:02:59.910> also<00:03:00.060> choose<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.940> right<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.269> my

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
would also choose all right so is my

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.039 
would also choose all right so is my
rock<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.349> see<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:06.329> Starkel<00:03:06.840> line

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
rock so you can see the Starkel line

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.229 
rock so you can see the Starkel line
where<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.890> branches<00:03:08.250> stop<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> snow<00:03:09.030> from

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
where the branches stop the snow from

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.699 
where the branches stop the snow from
falling<00:03:10.280> okay<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> nice<00:03:13.470> little

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
falling okay so now it's a nice little

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.270 
falling okay so now it's a nice little
Park<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.099> here<00:03:17.000> now<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> noticed<00:03:19.100> these<00:03:20.100> are<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
Park in here now I noticed these are the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.770 
Park in here now I noticed these are the
branches<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.760> talking<00:03:21.030> about<00:03:21.090> laying

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
branches I was talking about laying

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.809 
branches I was talking about laying
branches<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.440> them<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.489> noticed<00:03:23.989> over<00:03:24.989> here

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
branches on them and I noticed over here

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.970 
branches on them and I noticed over here
it's<00:03:26.819> another<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.209> right<00:03:27.389> there<00:03:27.769> some<00:03:28.769> take

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
it's another one right there some take

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:43.450 
it's another one right there some take
you<00:03:29.069> guys<00:03:29.190> over<00:03:29.430> there

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.620 

okay<00:03:44.460> there's<00:03:44.790> another<00:03:44.940> nice<00:03:45.150> spot<00:03:47.420> very<00:03:48.420> easy

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
okay there's another nice spot very easy

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.900 
okay there's another nice spot very easy
to<00:03:48.780> find<00:03:49.020> because<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.160> pine<00:03:50.370> needles<00:03:50.490> are

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
to find because the pine needles are

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.320 
to find because the pine needles are
clean<00:03:51.600> underneath<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.640> would<00:03:53.640> go<00:03:53.790> right<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.210> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
clean underneath I would go right in the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:02.540 
clean underneath I would go right in the
spa<00:03:54.600> right<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:59.360> right<00:04:00.360> in<00:04:00.390> there<00:04:01.280> all<00:04:02.280> right

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
spa right here right in there all right

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.840 
spa right here right in there all right
in<00:04:02.640> there

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.740 

all<00:04:10.850> right<00:04:11.380> another<00:04:12.380> dry<00:04:12.620> spot<00:04:13.540> there's<00:04:14.540> no

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
all right another dry spot there's no

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.979 
all right another dry spot there's no
snow<00:04:15.110> in<00:04:15.290> here<00:04:15.470> it's<00:04:16.630> it's<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.660> nice<00:04:17.810> little

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
snow in here it's it's a nice little

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.690 
snow in here it's it's a nice little
spot<00:04:18.290> as<00:04:18.470> well<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:18.859> not<00:04:18.980> as<00:04:19.100> nice<00:04:19.280> as<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.549> one

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
spot as well it's not as nice as the one

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.000 
spot as well it's not as nice as the one
that<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:19.850> already<00:04:19.940> found<00:04:21.010> definitely
