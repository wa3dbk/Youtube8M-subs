garden hose cool now let's turn on both
of<00:02:13.680> these<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> count<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.459> five<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:15.540> two

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
of these to the count of five one two

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.600 
of these to the count of five one two
three<00:02:17.129> four<00:02:17.910> five<00:02:18.599> as<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610

three four five as you can see the
garden<00:02:20.970> hose<00:02:21.150> poured<00:02:21.540> out<00:02:21.660> much<00:02:22.020> more<00:02:22.260> water

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
garden hose poured out much more water

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.449 
garden hose poured out much more water
than<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.770> fountain

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
than the fountain

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.790 
than the fountain
this<00:02:24.000> means<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.540> garden<00:02:24.930> hose<00:02:25.140> has<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> higher

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
this means the garden hose has a higher

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.869 
this means the garden hose has a higher
flow<00:02:26.190> rate<00:02:26.430> than<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.849> water<00:02:27.060> fountain<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.310> now

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
flow rate than the water fountain so now

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.360 
flow rate than the water fountain so now
back<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.480> hydrants<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.220> the
