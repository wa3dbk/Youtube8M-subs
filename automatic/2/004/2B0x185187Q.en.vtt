actually<00:00:42.629> bias<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:44.010> input<00:00:44.370> stage<00:00:44.610> four

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
actually bias the input stage four

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.569 
actually bias the input stage four
different<00:00:45.420> ways<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:47.010> almost<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.309> four

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
different ways so it's almost like four

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.690

being<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> marshall<00:00:51.960> style<00:00:52.230> bias

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
being kind of a marshall style bias

being kind of a marshall style bias
number<00:00:53.460> three<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> based<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> selmer<00:00:54.750> amp

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

that I really liked and two and four are
a<00:00:57.960> couple<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.590> came<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.309> they<00:01:00.379> affect

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a couple that I came up with they affect

the kind of character of the amp that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.460 
the kind of character of the amp that
how<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> saturates<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.600> bright<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.380> know

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
how it saturates how bright or you know

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
how it saturates how bright or you know
full<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.920> sounds<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.390> some<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.170> nice

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

little<00:01:10.650> presets<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> tweak<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> amp<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.939> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
little presets to tweak the amp in it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
little presets to tweak the amp in it's
great<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.630> matching<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> other<00:01:13.710> various

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
great for matching it to other various

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640 
great for matching it to other various
guitars<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> Les<00:01:15.450> Paul<00:01:15.479> being<00:01:15.990> more<00:01:16.380> full

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
example on SG or junior you know you can

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
example on SG or junior you know you can
kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> tune<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.880> volume<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.210> high

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
kind of tune it in volume there's high

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.460 
kind of tune it in volume there's high
and<00:01:24.600> low<00:01:24.720> inputs<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> normal<00:01:27.960> input<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and low inputs the normal input is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
and low inputs the normal input is
actually<00:01:29.189> relatively<00:01:29.850> Gainey<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.600> tends<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
actually relatively Gainey it tends to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
actually relatively Gainey it tends to
sound<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.680> classic<00:01:32.280> rock<00:01:32.610> amp<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
sound like a classic rock amp at that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
sound like a classic rock amp at that
point<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.590> put<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.280> high

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
point and then you can put really high

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
point and then you can put really high
gain<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> high<00:01:36.420> input<00:01:37.100> it's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
gain by going in the high input it's

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.480 
gain by going in the high input it's
it's<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> clean<00:01:38.970> amp<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> fender

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
high and low shelf I did that because I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609

treble<00:01:57.509> mid-bass<00:01:57.960> circuit<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.070> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
treble mid-bass circuit and I just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
treble mid-bass circuit and I just
thought<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> changed<00:01:59.939> too<00:02:00.119> much<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
thought it changed too much of that the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 
thought it changed too much of that the
actual<00:02:02.130> tone<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> amp<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.180> started<00:02:03.450> to

actual tone of the amp it started to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.969 
actual tone of the amp it started to
change<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> amp<00:02:04.350> actually<00:02:04.680> sounded

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
change what the amp actually sounded

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.730 
change what the amp actually sounded
like<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.840> part<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.350> there's<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
like so part of this is there's a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.930 
like so part of this is there's a
there's<00:02:08.099> several<00:02:08.310> tubes<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.849> they're

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
there's several tubes and they're

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.210 
there's several tubes and they're
driving<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> tone<00:02:09.690> circuit<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.319> well<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
driving the tone circuit as well so it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.160 
driving the tone circuit as well so it
adds<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> saturation<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.629> color<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
adds to the saturation and color of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.270 
adds to the saturation and color of
I<00:02:13.200> am<00:02:13.380> also<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> last<00:02:16.470> control<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
I am also and then the last control is a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.000 
I am also and then the last control is a
shape<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.020> actually<00:02:19.140> contour<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
shape you can actually contour the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.430 
shape you can actually contour the
tonality<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.000> power<00:02:21.180> section<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.170> not

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
tonality of the power section it's not

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.610 
tonality of the power section it's not
an<00:02:22.770> EQ<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:24.420> actually<00:02:24.750> changing<00:02:25.080> how<00:02:25.410> that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
an EQ it is actually changing how that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.010 
an EQ it is actually changing how that
the<00:02:26.130> power<00:02:26.340> amp<00:02:26.550> section<00:02:26.940> runs<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the power amp section runs that the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.559 
the power amp section runs that the
mid-range<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.160> affected<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.090> harmonic

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
mid-range is affected the harmonic

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.770 
mid-range is affected the harmonic
distortion<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.530> saturation<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.400> amp

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
distortion and the saturation of the amp

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.390 
distortion and the saturation of the amp
and<00:02:34.220> there<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.730> nineteen<00:02:36.720> wats

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
and there you go it's a nineteen wats

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.000 
and there you go it's a nineteen wats
Gav<00:02:38.400> 19t<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.330> called<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.590> coming<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
Gav 19t it's called and it's coming to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.730 
Gav 19t it's called and it's coming to
Sweetwater<00:02:41.220> soon
