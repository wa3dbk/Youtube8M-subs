00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
something to prove because of how the

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.350 
something to prove because of how the
opinion<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.340> think<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.490> at<00:04:02.610> first<00:04:02.850> after<00:04:03.209> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
opinion I think that at first after the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.090 
opinion I think that at first after the
World<00:04:03.570> Cup<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:03.900> did<00:04:04.140> have<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.620> felt<00:04:04.890> like<00:04:04.950> we

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
World Cup we did have we felt like we

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.470 
World Cup we did have we felt like we
had<00:04:05.160> something<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.610> prove<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.000> we<00:04:06.120> wanted

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
had something to prove and we wanted

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.510 
had something to prove and we wanted
Redemption<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.200> wanted<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:08.130> know<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.430> had

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
Redemption and we wanted you know we had

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.449 
Redemption and we wanted you know we had
all<00:04:08.670> these<00:04:08.820> feelings<00:04:09.080> but<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.890> last<00:04:11.100> couple

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
all these feelings but the last couple

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.590 
all these feelings but the last couple
of<00:04:11.520> months<00:04:11.700> have<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:11.970> brought<00:04:12.330> us<00:04:12.480> together

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
of months have just brought us together

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.860 
of months have just brought us together
we're<00:04:12.959> just<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.260> we're<00:04:13.590> really<00:04:14.040> confident<00:04:14.490> and

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
we're just so we're really confident and

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.539 
we're just so we're really confident and
going<00:04:15.870> off<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.350> recent<00:04:16.709> win<00:04:16.859> against<00:04:17.130> Japan

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
going off of a recent win against Japan

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.250 
going off of a recent win against Japan
that<00:04:17.790> obviously<00:04:18.120> helped<00:04:18.419> our<00:04:18.510> confidence<00:04:18.930> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
that obviously helped our confidence and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.420 
that obviously helped our confidence and
I<00:04:20.190> think<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.959> it's<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.350> weird<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.220> say<00:04:23.400> but

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
I think that it's it's weird to say but

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.210 
I think that it's it's weird to say but
I<00:04:23.640> think<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.660> we're<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.080> we're<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:25.980> better

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
I think that we're just we're a better

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.130 
I think that we're just we're a better
team<00:04:26.400> than<00:04:26.640> we<00:04:26.970> were<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.450> World<00:04:27.780> Cup<00:04:27.960> and

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
team than we were in the World Cup and

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.380 
team than we were in the World Cup and
it's<00:04:28.260> it's<00:04:28.950> hard<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.340> say<00:04:29.460> because<00:04:29.610> at<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
it's it's hard to say because at the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.880 
it's it's hard to say because at the
World<00:04:30.570> Cup<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.840> thought<00:04:31.050> we<00:04:31.200> were<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.470> best<00:04:31.680> of

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
World Cup I thought we were the best of

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.350 
World Cup I thought we were the best of
the<00:04:31.950> best<00:04:32.220> but<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.520> think<00:04:32.640> we're<00:04:32.940> even<00:04:32.970> better

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
the best but I think we're even better

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.290 
the best but I think we're even better
now<00:04:33.660> so<00:04:33.979> I'm<00:04:34.979> really<00:04:35.370> excited<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.910> show<00:04:36.120> that

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300
