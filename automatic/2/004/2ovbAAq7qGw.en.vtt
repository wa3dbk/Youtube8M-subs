00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
one and this is I like this one because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.720 
one and this is I like this one because
it's<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.949> suppose<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's kind of what I suppose it has that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's kind of what I suppose it has that
kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> Android<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> flip<00:00:58.260> clock<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
kind of Android kind of flip clock and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
kind of Android kind of flip clock and
kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> look<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> but<00:01:00.210> again<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.690> very

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
kind of look and but again it's very

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
kind of look and but again it's very
simplistic<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.070> simplistic

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
simplistic and I do like my simplistic

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.690 
simplistic and I do like my simplistic
themes<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.460> nice

clock has been shifted down so with all
of<00:03:08.310> these<00:03:08.550> themes<00:03:08.880> are<00:03:09.030> going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.210> be<00:03:09.270> what

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390

you're gonna want to use club hide or

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.460 
you're gonna want to use club hide or
your<00:03:11.310> lockscreen<00:03:11.490> clock<00:03:11.790> ID<00:03:12.020> so<00:03:13.020> you've

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
your lockscreen clock ID so you've

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.960 
your lockscreen clock ID so you've
hidden<00:03:13.710> at<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> top<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.430> then<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.700> kind

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
hidden at the top and then this is kind

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.850 
hidden at the top and then this is kind
of<00:03:15.000> shifted<00:03:15.390> down<00:03:15.600> which<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.960> nice<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.740> then

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
of shifted down which is nice and then

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.949 
of shifted down which is nice and then
you<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.340> difference<00:03:17.970> or<00:03:18.150> chrome<00:03:18.450> style

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you have this difference or chrome style

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.160 
you have this difference or chrome style
