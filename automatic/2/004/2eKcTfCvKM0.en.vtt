McCarthy seems to be I'm trying to put
this<00:02:35.140> delicately<00:02:35.430> using<00:02:36.430> her<00:02:36.550> size<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:37.210> almost

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
this delicately using her size is almost

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.960 
this delicately using her size is almost
a<00:02:37.720> comedic<00:02:38.080> crunch<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.460> get<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.910> sense

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
a comedic crunch and I do get that sense

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.660 
a comedic crunch and I do get that sense
myself<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:41.050> bit<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.440> think<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.220> she

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
myself a little bit I think that she

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.030 
myself a little bit I think that she
with<00:02:43.420> all<00:02:43.570> due<00:02:43.750> respect<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:44.230> Chris<00:02:44.470> Farley<00:02:44.890> who

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
with all due respect to Chris Farley who

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.100 
with all due respect to Chris Farley who
was<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> beloved<00:02:45.670> comedian<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.480> think<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
was a beloved comedian I think the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.020 
was a beloved comedian I think the
Melissa<00:02:47.350> McCarthy<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.160> smarter<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.760> more

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
Melissa McCarthy is smarter and more

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.610 
Melissa McCarthy is smarter and more
talented<00:02:49.600> than<00:02:49.780> having<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.170> resort<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.530> just

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
talented than having to resort to just

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.280 
talented than having to resort to just
merely<00:02:51.340> being<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:52.060> female<00:02:52.390> Chris<00:02:52.870> Farley<00:02:53.260> I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
merely being the female Chris Farley I

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.720 
merely being the female Chris Farley I
think<00:02:53.560> she<00:02:53.680> should<00:02:53.710> be<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:53.980> comedian<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.640> her

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
think she should be a comedian in her

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.450 
think she should be a comedian in her
own<00:02:54.910> right<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.080> see<00:02:56.380> elements<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.190> here

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
own right so I see elements of that here

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.310 
own right so I see elements of that here
though<00:02:57.610> which<00:02:57.820> disappoints<00:02:58.690> me<00:02:58.750> also<00:02:59.080> at

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
though which disappoints me also at

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.660 
though which disappoints me also at
least<00:02:59.440> she's<00:02:59.709> trying<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.280> at<00:03:00.370> least<00:03:00.489> she's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
least she's trying that at least she's

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.390

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
trying to build a character I've seen

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.890 
trying to build a character I've seen
some<00:03:03.580> people<00:03:03.700> said<00:03:04.270> they<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.510> when<00:03:04.630> she<00:03:04.780> runs

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
some people said they like when she runs

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.020 
some people said they like when she runs
away<00:03:05.110> from<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.380> police<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.489> also<00:03:06.790> my

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
away from the police that is also my

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.420 
away from the police that is also my
favorite<00:03:07.450> bit<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.410> trailer<00:03:08.860> because<00:03:09.070> I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
favorite bit in this trailer because I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.800 
favorite bit in this trailer because I
think<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.880> funny<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.180> she<00:03:10.390> just<00:03:10.540> gives<00:03:10.720> it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
think it's funny that she just gives it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.930 
think it's funny that she just gives it
the<00:03:10.930> old<00:03:11.080> try<00:03:11.380> but<00:03:11.680> it's<00:03:11.770> clearly<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.459> unable

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the old try but it's clearly so unable

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.180 
the old try but it's clearly so unable
to<00:03:13.150> escape<00:03:13.450> from<00:03:13.750> them<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.830> like<00:03:14.980> they're

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
to escape from them and I like they're

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.770 
to escape from them and I like they're
like<00:03:15.340> really<00:03:15.520> come<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:15.880> man<00:03:16.150> really<00:03:16.630> are<00:03:16.720> you

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
like really come on man really are you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.120 
like really come on man really are you
really<00:03:16.900> gonna<00:03:17.110> try<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.890> think<00:03:17.950> it

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
really gonna try this because I think it

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.070 
really gonna try this because I think it
just<00:03:18.310> reminds<00:03:18.610> me<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.760> actual<00:03:19.270> Encounters<00:03:20.050> of

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
just reminds me of actual Encounters of

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.410 
just reminds me of actual Encounters of
real-life<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:21.280> know<00:03:21.400> low-level<00:03:22.030> criminals

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
real-life you know low-level criminals

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
real-life you know low-level criminals
with<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.690> police<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.470> bit<00:03:23.830> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
with the police so I like that bit of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.920 
with the police so I like that bit of
realism<00:03:24.310> however<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:25.239> seems<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.600> little<00:03:25.690> bit

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
realism however it seems a little bit

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.750 
realism however it seems a little bit
like<00:03:26.020> it's<00:03:26.230> lifted<00:03:26.620> for<00:03:26.800> my<00:03:26.890> identity<00:03:27.550> thief

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
like it's lifted for my identity thief

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.400 
like it's lifted for my identity thief
where<00:03:28.000> she<00:03:28.120> was<00:03:28.239> running<00:03:28.510> from<00:03:28.570> Jason<00:03:29.020> Bateman

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
where she was running from Jason Bateman

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.840 
where she was running from Jason Bateman
so<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.100> hope<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.370> this

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
so I hope that this

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.760 
so I hope that this
I<00:03:30.880> hope<00:03:31.150> there's<00:03:31.330> more<00:03:31.390> fresh<00:03:32.050> material<00:03:32.620> here

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
I hope there's more fresh material here

Melissa McCarthy could really go

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.199

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
I'm hoping that the second trailer for

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.110 
I'm hoping that the second trailer for
this<00:05:01.500> will<00:05:01.680> be<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.800> little<00:05:02.100> bit<00:05:02.220> better<00:05:02.370> and

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
this will be a little bit better and

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.450 
this will be a little bit better and
have<00:05:03.330> more<00:05:04.140> new<00:05:04.380> material<00:05:04.920> but<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.100> guess<00:05:05.280> not

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
have more new material but I guess not

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.980 
have more new material but I guess not
too<00:05:05.640> much<00:05:05.850> because<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.420> moat<00:05:06.570> will<00:05:06.690> be<00:05:06.810> left

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
too much because the moat will be left

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.780 
too much because the moat will be left
for<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.350> movie<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:07.770> interestingly<00:05:08.070> this

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790
