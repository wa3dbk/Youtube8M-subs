00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
we were on it right here but actually we

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.840 
we were on it right here but actually we
were<00:00:51.410> just<00:00:51.440> right<00:00:51.710> next<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:52.039> it<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.640> just

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
were just right next to it but just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.669 
were just right next to it but just
couch<00:00:53.300> numb<00:00:53.570> crouch<00:00:53.780> jump<00:00:54.019> until<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.499> get

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
couch numb crouch jump until you get

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.590 
couch numb crouch jump until you get
onto<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.190> then<00:00:55.699> as<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:55.999> guys<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.300> see<00:00:56.359> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
onto it and then as you guys can see the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.180 
onto it and then as you guys can see the
flames<00:00:56.839> recovering<00:00:57.320> up<00:00:57.440> completely<00:00:57.829> your

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
flames recovering up completely your

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.329 
flames recovering up completely your
screen<00:00:58.429> is<00:00:58.609> partially<00:00:59.469> hidden<00:01:00.469> too<00:01:00.800> but<00:01:01.129> I

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
screen is partially hidden too but I

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.250 
screen is partially hidden too but I
think<00:01:01.699> it's<00:01:01.850> worth<00:01:01.909> it<00:01:02.179> for<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:02.449> now<00:01:03.079> this

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
helicopter now this is a very simple one

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.920 
helicopter now this is a very simple one
but<00:01:06.830> possibly<00:01:07.580> very<00:01:07.760> effective<00:01:08.360> maybe<00:01:08.690> with<00:01:08.840> a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
but possibly very effective maybe with a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.590 
but possibly very effective maybe with a
sniper<00:01:09.140> or<00:01:09.500> sounds<00:01:09.830> assault<00:01:10.340> rifle<00:01:10.730> you<00:01:11.300> jump

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
sniper or sounds assault rifle you jump

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.240 
sniper or sounds assault rifle you jump
onto<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:11.990> frame<00:01:12.260> of<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.470> helicopter<00:01:12.710> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
onto the frame of the helicopter and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.550 
onto the frame of the helicopter and
onto<00:01:13.610> one<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.730> the<00:01:13.880> blades<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:15.050> lie

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
onto one of the blades and you just lie

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.890 
onto one of the blades and you just lie
down<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.240> basically<00:01:17.240> there's<00:01:17.510> one<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.780> your

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900

camping spots now if you just walk back

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.150 
camping spots now if you just walk back
a<00:01:20.630> tiny<00:01:20.930> bit<00:01:21.110> because<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.380> one<00:01:21.590> itself<00:01:21.980> isn't

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
a tiny bit because this one itself isn't

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.500 
a tiny bit because this one itself isn't
very<00:01:22.460> good<00:01:22.640> because<00:01:22.910> you'll<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:23.120> get<00:01:23.240> sniped

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510

after<00:01:32.750> long<00:01:33.110> jump<00:01:33.440> over<00:01:33.680> here<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.250> have<00:01:34.370> to

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
after long jump over here you have to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.950 
after long jump over here you have to
jump<00:01:34.790> as<00:01:34.970> soon<00:01:35.120> as<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.300> hit<00:01:35.390> that<00:01:35.540> little<00:01:35.720> hill

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
jump as soon as you hit that little hill

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.720 
jump as soon as you hit that little hill
and<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.470> basically<00:01:36.650> jump<00:01:37.100> over<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.400> crater

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
and you basically jump over that crater

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.230 
and you basically jump over that crater
right<00:01:37.880> over<00:01:38.090> there<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:40.040> wherever<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:41.030> see

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
right over there so wherever you see

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.910 
right over there so wherever you see
wood<00:01:41.420> over<00:01:41.660> here<00:01:41.690> it's<00:01:42.200> all<00:01:42.410> connected<00:01:42.590> with

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
wood over here it's all connected with

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.590 
wood over here it's all connected with
what<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.190> can<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:43.460> anywhere<00:01:43.880> now<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.540> is

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
what you can get anywhere now this is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.390 
what you can get anywhere now this is
not<00:01:44.840> necessarily<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.500> very<00:01:45.740> good<00:01:45.980> spot<00:01:46.130> or

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
not necessarily a very good spot or

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.590 
not necessarily a very good spot or
anything<00:01:46.760> but<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:46.970> think<00:01:47.240> it's<00:01:47.360> pretty<00:01:47.480> funny

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
anything but I think it's pretty funny

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.270 
anything but I think it's pretty funny
and<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.380> think<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.620> can<00:01:48.740> make<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.070> your<00:01:49.160> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
and I think you can make it to your you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280 
and I think you can make it to your you
