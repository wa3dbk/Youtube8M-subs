00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310
 none of the friends that climb 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.090
 so I asked the crew members who do not accompany what 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.290
 They gladly agreed, even Captain Pitt was in charge of commanding the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930
 leak 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 when we fell into the water and we submerged, the idea of ​​a museum came to my mind 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.740
 has happened but the prejudice changed 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.330
 when cougars showed a free from the sea that walked lonely putting 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.700
 microalgae 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.430
 later he showed a huge black costume moving between his hands 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.470
 as soon as he left it in the sand he hurried the step he disappeared into a reef 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.840
 apart from the presence of some fish like torito sardines píparo 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.670
 the museum went without a break a worthy closing was a wonderful up 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.840
 day in the magical chinchorro 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.160
 we had a leisurely dinner, we raised the wide ones to go north to the beach of the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.850
 Carmen 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.840
 where we have an appointment with the stylized bull sharks 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.930
 Upon our arrival Playa del Carmen did not expect our friend Jorge the Chinese 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.270
 Loria, Andalusian de facto owner 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.630
 d together with your assistant 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.860
 the young brave carlos estrado managed that the sharks in 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.600
 approach the divers 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.970
 we prepare ourselves taking our time wanting to lengthen the moment before 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.220
 enter the year 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.130
 we submerge ourselves in a sea of ​​a storm of blue that only the Caribbean can 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.260
 produce since we started the decline the sharks made their appearance 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.719
 when we reached 90 feet at the bottom of the sand the Chinese put us in position 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:13.999
 and found that everything was in order while the sharks were waiting 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.369
 already with very little patience his daily food ration 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.160
 previously 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.660
 I explained to my friends that we would be in front of a powerful 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.240
 killing machine that we would be in their element and if that were not enough we have them 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.059
 to attract with blood and guts of fish 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.370
 that we have to pay attention to the indications of Chinese and extreme 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.479
 precautions 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.089
 and is that although there has never been an attack on divers by these 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.089
 fantastic animals we do not want to be the first 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.310
 However, I also told you that these animals are not as bad as 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.599
 they paint quique lieutenant to be relaxed to be able to enjoy since these are one of 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.620
 the few times we can see and observe these titans so close 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.019
 the chinese opened the juve is with the remains of fish isaac started the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.369
 wake 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:10.399
 the sharks were fighting over a piece of meat moving with energy 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:14.859
 seeming not to care about our presence they passed us so close to 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.679
 we who could almost touch them is amazing what our eyes 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:20.639
 presence 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.849
 being so close to one the animals that most controversy has caused the 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.129
 humanity that are reputed to be murderers and drafts 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.870
 however the sharks do nothing to attack and I could almost say they are 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.639
 shy and who know the wickedness of human beings that tiresome beautiful 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.599
 legislated to get a few pounds of cartilage from their fins for 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.469
 Soup 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:50.279
 and a few inches of skin for shoemaker is sad to witness these 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:52.459
 animals finish this way 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.519
 and let the name be the one that ends with a former president who has survived for 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.369
 more than 350 million euros 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.570
 the rise back to the controlled east 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.820
 because our blood was loaded with a large dose of nitrogen 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.469
 the decompression stop 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.369
 It did not serve to reflect on the good things that life offers us 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.539
 the days were few and the experiences too much especially for 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.530
 realize that the sea is a paradise that still has abundant resources 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:31.119
 fishing and a very diverse underwater life capable of wonder with more 

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:32.599
 museum experts 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.349
 while offering the possibility of discovering hidden secrets saved with 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.349
 zeal between sand and time 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.869
 However, it should not be forgotten that overexploitation of resources 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:50.759
 caused its exhaustion and may end with a source of knowledge 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.219
 and fun on Tuesday until now 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.819
 one of the last places where many memories remain intact 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.379
 for many centuries 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.020
 alfredo and silvia 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.000
 once again I thank you from all of your friends and colleagues 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.830
 of diving for making a dream a hammer
