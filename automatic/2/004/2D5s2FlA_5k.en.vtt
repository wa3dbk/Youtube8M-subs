evaporate over onto the ice crystals we

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.890 
evaporate over onto the ice crystals we
say<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.580> vapor<00:02:29.760> pressure<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.269> water<00:02:30.390> is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
say that the vapor pressure of water is

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.839 
say that the vapor pressure of water is
higher<00:02:31.560> than<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> vapor<00:02:32.159> pressure<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.670> ice

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
higher than the vapor pressure of ice

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.030 
higher than the vapor pressure of ice
crystals<00:02:33.409> therefore<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:34.560> water<00:02:34.739> all

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
disappears onto the ice crystals the ice

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.910 
disappears onto the ice crystals the ice
crystals<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.170> see<00:02:40.349> here<00:02:40.680> are

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
crystals that you see here are

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.009 
crystals that you see here are
scintillating<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.450> colors<00:02:42.780> are

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
scintillating and the colors are

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.690 
scintillating and the colors are
produced<00:02:43.409> by<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.680> fact<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.159> there<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.489> tiny

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
