00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.429
 mitsubishi represents the fifth generation 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.080
 his pickup l200 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 and the most important question is what has changed 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 in this car because essentially for 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.350
 This workhorse is important not to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.350
 almost nothing has changed 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.240
 and although or 200 is called the new generation 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.259
 in fact there is a share of cunning 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.239
 platform as a wheelbase remained 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.210
 the former is therefore more correct to talk about 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.220
 very solid crystal but common 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 Parts from the previous version still need 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.269
 will look for a completely new body 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.420
 besides the appearance of his managed 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.680
 improve and in terms of aerodynamics 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.280
 drag coefficient is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.290
 0.42 for cars the number is scary but for 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.659
 pickups as claimed by mitsubishi 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.370
 best in class there are new options 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.409
 Head optics are not only offered. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.900
 halogen but also xenon, if desired 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.900
 there is a place and a regular video stone 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 of course they could not make the car 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.960
 which has not changed at all namely 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.670
 as a rule, everyone is afraid of her because 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.549
 what's the trend now 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.710
 more civilian cars more ordinary 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.650
 not as all road as they were 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.939
 before but here is almost nothing 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.770
 really in this regard has not changed 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.380
 most important this body structure and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.360
 suspension two-zone cabin layout and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 cargo platform with the letter j 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.350
 remained the same suspension 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.250
 upgraded springs lengthened by 100 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.620
 millimeters changed all the body supports 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.460
 the frame is still there and the system is complete 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.330
 the drive 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.460
 it was just improved as before it 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.290
 famous super select 4 vd 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.300
 only now mode switching 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.920
 produced electronics up to a hundred 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.869
 kilometers per hour the driver can safely 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.880
 switch the car rear wheel drive 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.680
 on full and vice versa and mode with 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 locked center differential 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.039
 and downshift can 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.719
 use only on mother speeds 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.729
 we are at a closed test site in 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.289
 Japan where these cars are tested and 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.560
 I must say that the car behaves very 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.239
 not bad it's on asphalt of course it 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.819
 talking about pickup it is clear that he will and 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.080
 rolls and soft at the same time but at the same time 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.480
 I must say that it is comfortable enough and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.629
 even here a 180-degree turn he 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.810
 behaves fine bow almost like 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.120
 car last but not least 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.549
 thanks to a sharper steering with the same 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.930
 turning radius of 59 meters to turn 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.120
 the steering wheel will need less 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.489
 by the way speaking generally all over the world will be 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.140
 three petrol engines available old 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.760
 diesel and new but in Russia will be 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.299
 delivered only new power 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
 unit 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.000
 which is surprisingly nice usually for 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.360
 Our market prepares something 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.240
 simpler and quicker 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.180
 latest technology 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.959
 This is a diesel engine 4 n15 volume 2 4 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 issuing 181 liters not really well and 430 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.780
 newton per meter 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.819
 in addition to improved elasticity and 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.349
 economy mitsubishi promise and 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.630
 lower maintenance cost 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.239
 obsolete timing belt taken on target 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.459
 no replacement at all 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.950
 operating a car of your choice 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.870
 available for new boxes 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.310
 6-speed and five -speed mechanics 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 automatic and that is important not lost 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.140
 off-road performance they did 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.580
 its more comfortable eg mode and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.260
 all-wheel drive transmission now 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.260
 stop special swivel 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.989
 washer they lever type cpr how would that 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.180
 It was before and it is really convenient 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.680
 now almost all versions available 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.840
 exchange rate stabilization system 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.459
 sustainability can't say that on this 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.380
 car is probably the most important 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.150
 option but in any case 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.150
 she will definitely not be superfluous 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.879
 ascetic interior of the eternal laborer 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.590
 the Japanese have ennobled the plastic panel already 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.900
 not deterred its cheapness and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.939
 the number of available options is equal to 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.310
 a set of such civil models 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.140
 companies this and keyless access 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.000
 salon and separate climate control and 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.099
 large multimedia system with 7-inch 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.469
 screen and more 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.900
 By the way, the place inside also became more 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:20.489
 almost in all directions added 12 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.489
 extra centimeter 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.650
 Well, we arrived at the off-road section 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.720
 to look at what this one is capable of 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.900
 car organizers here 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.950
 cooked a few say so 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.890
 big score tests they of course 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.730
 children especially such a car 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.020
 call on a couple a hill 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.300
 it is not for him at all 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.000
 no difficulty as now 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.360
 selected reduced mode 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.040
 transmissions the word ground clearance is not 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.770
 changed the Russian version will be 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.020
 be 205 millimeters and here are the corners 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.620
 departures due to new design and 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.930
 long overhangs slightly worse 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.020
 but here by the way here is 5 Surkov food 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.020
 health 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.050
 I'm talking to you right now 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.780
 overcome all these obstacles and 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.060
 I feel absolutely normal it 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.160
 really great achievement though in 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.290
 principle and the previous 200 were different 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.730
 what can a very unpretentious road 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.410
 cover could go almost anywhere so 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.410
 it's semi for follower 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.570
 yes class 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.120
 rare case when concerns were 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.980
 really vain machine 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.170
 almost unchanged at least 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:54.120
 for the important point for which you are her 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.980
 love mitsubishi l200 endangered species 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.380
 real workhorse which 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.300
 getting smaller accordingly and 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.180
 not her cryo 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.100
 civil engineers hunters up just 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.140
 outdoor enthusiasts 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.120
 we calculated how much it cost 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.130
 first year of ownership mitsubishi l200 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.630
 and that's what happened by the way official 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.850
 there is no price yet 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.250
 pre all required expenses 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.870
 motor insurance policy 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.610
 and maintenance 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.690
 we have developed a loss of car value for 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.280
 year and fuel consumption perimeter of this 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.710
 511 thousand 220 rubles 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.840
 so one kilometer of the way is 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.840
 20 rubles and 44 pennies
