matches<00:02:12.170> on<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.350> servers<00:02:12.740> when<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> did<00:02:13.520> get

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
time I spent almost as much time I think

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.590 
time I spent almost as much time I think
in<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.250> lobbies<00:02:16.610> waiting<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> find<00:02:17.150> matches

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
in the lobbies waiting to find matches

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600 
in the lobbies waiting to find matches
as<00:02:17.750> they<00:02:17.870> did<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.050> game<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.740> I'm<00:02:19.160> going<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.370> park

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.660 
although I'm almost 48 so hopefully it
won't<00:02:56.780> take<00:02:56.840> too<00:02:56.960> too<00:02:57.320> long<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.280> gameplay

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
won't take too too long and the gameplay

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.420 
won't take too too long and the gameplay
that<00:02:58.820> I've<00:02:58.940> selected<00:02:59.360> here<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:01.010> run-through

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
that I've selected here is a run-through

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.000 
that I've selected here is a run-through
on<00:03:01.730> valpariso<00:03:02.450> where<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.900> go<00:03:03.080> like<00:03:03.350> 20<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:03.860> two

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
on valpariso where I go like 20 and two

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.040 
on valpariso where I go like 20 and two
so<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:05.030> isn't<00:03:05.360> something<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.720> I'm<00:03:05.900> going

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
so this isn't something that I'm going

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.720 
so this isn't something that I'm going
to<00:03:06.140> commentate<00:03:06.560> for<00:03:06.830> them<00:03:06.920> for<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.250> value<00:03:07.610> of

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
to commentate for them for the value of

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.900 
to commentate for them for the value of
the<00:03:07.820> gameplay<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.410> do<00:03:09.590> show<00:03:10.220> how<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.580> can

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the gameplay but I do show how I can

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.030 
the gameplay but I do show how I can
unleash<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.450> power<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:11.990> peepee<00:03:12.410> on<00:03:12.620> an

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
by going to your friends list and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.360 
by going to your friends list and
highlighting<00:04:27.110> syrupy<00:04:27.560> cheese<00:04:27.770> which<00:04:28.099> was<00:04:28.220> my

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
what i want and i really do want to face

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.769 
what i want and i really do want to face
this<00:06:15.800> off<00:06:16.009> against<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.400> xm8<00:06:16.819> compact<00:06:17.360> to<00:06:17.539> see

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
this off against the xm8 compact to see

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.409 
this off against the xm8 compact to see
which<00:06:18.469> is<00:06:18.620> my<00:06:18.770> favorite<00:06:19.219> because<00:06:19.270> except<00:06:20.270> for

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
which is my favorite because except for

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.260 
which is my favorite because except for
the<00:06:20.479> ammo<00:06:20.719> capacity<00:06:20.979> which<00:06:21.979> is<00:06:22.009> which<00:06:22.969> is<00:06:23.000> low

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
the ammo capacity which is which is low

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.790 
the ammo capacity which is which is low
i<00:06:23.300> mean<00:06:23.509> this<00:06:23.599> thing<00:06:23.779> burns<00:06:24.020> through<00:06:24.199> a<00:06:24.349> lot<00:06:24.650> of

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
i mean this thing burns through a lot of

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.529 
i mean this thing burns through a lot of
ammo<00:06:25.069> but<00:06:25.639> so<00:06:25.880> once<00:06:26.029> you<00:06:26.120> get<00:06:26.240> used<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.449> the

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
ammo but so once you get used to the

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.029 
ammo but so once you get used to the
iron<00:06:26.779> sights<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.110> can<00:06:27.229> kind<00:06:27.409> of<00:06:27.469> counter<00:06:27.860> that

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
iron sights you can kind of counter that

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.519 
iron sights you can kind of counter that
I<00:06:28.400> think<00:06:29.240> this<00:06:29.479> might<00:06:29.719> be<00:06:29.960> in<00:06:30.169> the<00:06:30.259> running<00:06:30.440> for

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:30.529 
I think this might be in the running for

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.279 
I think this might be in the running for
my<00:06:30.740> favorite<00:06:31.159> so<00:06:31.449> I'll<00:06:32.449> definitely<00:06:32.659> play

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
my favorite so I'll definitely play

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.499 
my favorite so I'll definitely play
around<00:06:33.529> a<00:06:33.680> little<00:06:33.710> bit<00:06:34.009> more<00:06:34.190> once<00:06:34.639> once<00:06:35.270> i<00:06:35.360> get

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
around a little bit more once once i get

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.329 
around a little bit more once once i get
to<00:06:35.599> that<00:06:35.690> point<00:06:35.930> but<00:06:36.440> i<00:06:36.500> just<00:06:36.710> wanted<00:06:37.099> to<00:06:37.130> keep

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:37.339 
to that point but i just wanted to keep
