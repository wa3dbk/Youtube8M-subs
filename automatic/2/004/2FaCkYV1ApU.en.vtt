00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello today on our review 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.910
 tractors mtz 80 belarus 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.550
 and magazine series tractors number six from 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 ashot or aj et collection first that i 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.199
 I want to say that the tractor is painted in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 red color even i can add something 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.920
 branch of beauty 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 it seems to me that more familiar to us 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.320
 Was mts-80 precisely in blue such 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.040
 how the MTZ-50 journal series was painted 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.460
 I also want to say that of course 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 met and mts-80 and in red 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.559
 but not met very rarely and not 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.350
 often as blue here come in blue 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.090
 just met there for all sorts 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.789
 collective farm and everything else is the same 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.629
 further well let's go to the model stan 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 and look at her, but here 's a good one. 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.390
 front headlights are made also want 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.120
 notice that they are the headlight lens 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 separately made from the rest 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.049
 parts of the lantern are then painted over here 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.650
 we can see and turn signals and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.990
 small such lights and they will see see 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.560
 orange is exactly the turn signal 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.759
 painted but on a red caustic color right 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.780
 he is barely noticeable 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.570
 here we can see an eye made 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.329
 then from wider brush painted black 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.020
 color and she's just so grooved but i 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.810
 I mean, there is a volume further we 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 we can see that the wheels are very good 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.640
 front tires are also made 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.229
 very good but what about the rear wheels 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.399
 as well as in the first issue of the MTS-50 also 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.960
 they haven't done 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:00.060
 here the holes that is, everything remains the same 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 as it was in the first issue here but what I 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.479
 I want to say you can of course repeat that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.959
 what can this be easily redone there 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.710
 to make a hole but still wanted 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.490
 to make a deadline 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.540
 further well done here 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.230
 exactly hinge door knob door 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.300
 did well but they were most often 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.540
 It was with silver color 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.450
 painted here are not painted just in color 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 the tractor itself still want to notice what 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.280
 the engine is fully decorated here 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.830
 red though here it is not bad 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.230
 worked out also here we can on the bridge 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.930
 After all, there are all sorts of bolts screws and all 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.200
 the rest well, let's from the other side 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.010
 consider the model still want to notice something 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.860
 that here here is the plastic detail department 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 made and footboards and up model by the way 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.370
 I want to say done 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.500
 most of the metals since here and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.220
 pepper we make here the engine hood out 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.170
 metal 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.350
 the cabin is made of metal and here are the wings and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.290
 you can say the lowest cabin itself 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.810
 made of plastic and here the substrate here 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.540
 so wheels well wheels by itself arches 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.690
 made of plastic and everything else 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.110
 made of iron but here you can see 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.310
 the filter is made later and sewn the case 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.340
 here made plastic muffler and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.040
 and there you can see right where it will find there with 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 so did quite well done 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.370
 whether the rearview mirrors were separated either 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.810
 kind of and they took and prokrase 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.040
 and even behind this silver here 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.220
 there is also the type and the mirror itself but also lights 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.320
 back to do or parts like that 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.960
 I want to show what is painted 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.240
 orange color here turn signals but 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.820
 they poured noodles noticeably on a red background 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.060
 Well, not very well it seems to me that 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.880
 if it were individual 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.940
 turn signals that is plastic poured and 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.130
 separately would be pushed into the wing then 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.910
 looked much more believable 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.820
 more beautiful 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.460
 but here we can see the tow 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.020
 device ie hitch 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.389
 with a trailer tank and I also want to notice 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.069
 that back window and min ago 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.349
 here here is completely made of 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.840
 plastic and look 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.750
 made a glass seal from black 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.039
 color and even under the seal here 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.190
 it should be like iron 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.699
 spatial precisely caracas itself 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.940
 rear window bullshit already started to carry here 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.400
 and this particular qar caviar carcass bottom even 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.419
 although it is made of plastic is not painted in 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.139
 Red color 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:06.360
 yes, of course I am not very nice to me 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:09.759
 it seems that it would not really work 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.419
 developers did not consist there just 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.990
 hold the red line and all well and 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:19.720
 let's see the salon salon I want 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.470
 say done just like in all 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.729
 the rest of the tractors was then very 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.669
 great look all visible 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:31.120
 sensors all done well there is a steering wheel 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:34.000
 Separate detail and seat look 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.949
 also done well by the way janitor departure 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.909
 together with glass and painted black 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.630
 by color 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.909
 that is, it is not made separately further 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:47.259
 I want to see we look Tamagotchi 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:53.800
 visible here as well let's see with 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:55.870
 On the other hand, they are visible there but 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.389
 salon done very reliably and 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.699
 plausible in general models to me 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.639
 enjoyed it all done very caffeine 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.400
 I also want to note the fact that there are many 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.280
 metal that is less plastic that is 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.460
 I mean, the developers are here. 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.979
 for spending you can say so but all 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.229
 did it seem to me that if 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.180
 painted all the same in more familiar 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.659
 the blue color that model would be different 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.229
 has played but so the model is worth the money 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:29.490
 and I advise you to get it all thanks 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.490
 for watching bye
