 I'm gonna start my little list with

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
 I'm gonna start my little list with
the<00:00:42.090> most<00:00:42.360> common<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.960> probably<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the most common one probably and that is

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
the most common one probably and that is
the<00:00:44.399> cold<00:00:44.670> England<00:00:45.629> has<00:00:45.809> extremely

unpredictable<00:00:47.039> weather<00:00:47.640> especially<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
unpredictable weather especially at the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.380 
unpredictable weather especially at the
minute<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.500> there's<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.000> 100<00:00:51.000> mile<00:00:51.180> an

summer you will probably leave your
house<00:00:55.440> thinking<00:00:56.129> oh<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> good

then don't being greeted by the exact

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
then don't being greeted by the exact
polar<00:01:01.199> opposite<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> thought<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
polar opposite of what you thought it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.030

would<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.789> winter<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.750> ended<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.769> time

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
would be winter has just ended it's time

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
would be winter has just ended it's time
to<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.369> warm<00:01:05.610> again<00:01:05.970> I've<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.360> hat<00:01:06.570> just

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
to get warm again I've got my hat just

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.060 
to get warm again I've got my hat just
in<00:01:07.049> case<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.680> cold

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
in case it's a bit cold

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.120 
in case it's a bit cold
let's<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.590 

well<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> next<00:01:14.700> thing<00:01:14.820> I've<00:01:15.060> got<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.390> list

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
well the next thing I've got on my list

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.410 
well the next thing I've got on my list
is<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> waking<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.090> hell

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
is that waking up is hell

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
is that waking up is hell
now<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> point<00:01:19.140> may<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.829> down<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
now this point may just be down to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
now this point may just be down to
laziness<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.060> eternal<00:01:21.509> battle<00:01:21.689> for

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
laziness and my eternal battle for

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
laziness and my eternal battle for
relaxation<00:01:22.469> or<00:01:23.219> doing<00:01:23.610> something<00:01:23.939> productive

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
relaxation or doing something productive

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
relaxation or doing something productive
with<00:01:24.539> my<00:01:24.569> life<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.409> waking<00:01:25.649> up<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.159> 7:00<00:01:26.429> in

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
with my life but waking up at 7:00 in

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
with my life but waking up at 7:00 in
the<00:01:26.700> morning<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.329> winter<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.200> probably<00:01:28.679> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the morning in winter is probably the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
the morning in winter is probably the
hardest<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.969> will<00:01:30.090> ever<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.539> to<00:01:30.569> do

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
hardest thing you will ever have to do

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
hardest thing you will ever have to do
unless<00:01:31.409> you're<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> reasonable<00:01:32.130> human<00:01:32.280> being

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
unless you're a reasonable human being

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.789 
unless you're a reasonable human being

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
of course this next point is kind of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859 
of course this next point is kind of
emphasis<00:01:35.219> on<00:01:35.369> how<00:01:35.579> boring<00:01:36.060> England<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> in
