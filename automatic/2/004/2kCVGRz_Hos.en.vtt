00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
Nets you um I can't count five points

per turn in the last the last province
is<00:01:11.040> worth<00:01:11.280> um<00:01:12.260> six<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> i<00:01:15.799> think<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.189> province

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
is worth um six so i think the province

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
is worth um six so i think the province
version<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.270> did<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.750> got<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
version it did I got to think about it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
version it did I got to think about it
later<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.820> comes<00:01:21.030> decision

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
later on when it actually comes decision

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
later on when it actually comes decision
decision<00:01:22.530> point<00:01:22.799> time<00:01:23.009> um<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.700> we'll<00:01:26.880> see

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
decision point time um but we'll see

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
decision point time um but we'll see
we'll<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:27.990> one's<00:01:28.200> fast<00:01:28.470> enough<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
we'll see which one's fast enough this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
we'll see which one's fast enough this
is<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> terrible<00:01:29.460> terrible<00:01:30.000> terrible<00:01:30.450> draw<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
is a terrible terrible terrible draw for
