that right there this is a 57 round

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:50.630 
that right there this is a 57 round
window<00:00:48.440> needs<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.710> everything<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> no

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.270 

I'm<00:01:04.960> not<00:01:05.110> even<00:01:05.350> sure<00:01:05.500> if<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:05.680> want<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.920> take<00:01:06.100> it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
I'm not even sure if I want to take it

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.340 
I'm not even sure if I want to take it
on<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.640> off<00:01:06.759> it's<00:01:07.299> one<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.630> those<00:01:07.690> deals<00:01:07.990> where

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
on and off it's one of those deals where

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:23.490 
on and off it's one of those deals where
if<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:08.680> do<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.400> can<00:01:14.100> probably<00:01:15.100> wire

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.840 

and<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.590> thing<00:01:24.829> that<00:01:24.860> makes<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.250> cool<00:01:25.549> is<00:01:25.820> that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and the thing that makes it cool is that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.940 
and the thing that makes it cool is that
it's<00:01:26.270> old<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:32.329> off<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.780> lot<00:01:33.020> of<00:01:33.049> work<00:01:33.289> as

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
it's old the off a lot of work as

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.029 
it's old the off a lot of work as
opposed<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.930> red<00:01:35.930> bug<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.380> get<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.619> on<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.829> road

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
opposed to red bug to get it on the road

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.410 
opposed to red bug to get it on the road
so<00:01:41.110> there's<00:01:42.110> something<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.530> think<00:01:42.619> about

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
so there's something to think about

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.179 
so there's something to think about
mmm<00:01:44.479> what<00:01:44.750> do<00:01:44.840> y'all<00:01:44.960> think<00:01:45.009> it's<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:46.159> a

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
mmm what do y'all think it's on a

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.160 
mmm what do y'all think it's on a
late-model<00:01:46.399> frame<00:01:46.939> I<00:01:46.970> think<00:01:47.360> that's<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.570> 73

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
late-model frame I think that's a 73

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.020 
late-model frame I think that's a 73
frame<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.740> kind<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.130> tailed<00:01:49.369> by<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.579> for<00:01:49.820> boat

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
frame and kind of tailed by the for boat

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:01.059 
frame and kind of tailed by the for boat
wheels<00:01:50.829> rotting<00:01:51.829> back<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:59.740> think<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.830> pan

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
wheels rotting back I think the pan

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:08.460 
wheels rotting back I think the pan
itself<00:02:01.429> might<00:02:01.700> be<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.909> pretty<00:02:02.119> decent<00:02:02.330> shape

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.559 

what<00:02:09.470> we'd<00:02:09.649> do<00:02:09.799> if<00:02:10.009> we<00:02:10.190> had<00:02:10.640> bibs<00:02:11.030> if<00:02:11.299> we<00:02:11.420> was

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
what we'd do if we had bibs if we was

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.170 
what we'd do if we had bibs if we was
cutting<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.019> out<00:02:12.519> takes<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.670> piece<00:02:13.910> out<00:02:14.150> of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
cutting that out takes that piece out of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.830 
cutting that out takes that piece out of
that<00:02:14.390> one<00:02:14.590> we're<00:02:15.590> going<00:02:15.739> over<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.840> that's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
that one we're going over here that's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:34.980 
that one we're going over here that's
how<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.080> would<00:02:18.290> work

it's clock top but around windows are
more<00:03:16.520> valuable<00:03:17.420> than<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.990> newer<00:03:18.800> ones<00:03:19.330> with

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
more valuable than the newer ones with

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.490 
more valuable than the newer ones with
the<00:03:20.480> other<00:03:20.630> type<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:20.960> window<00:03:23.440> mm-hmm<00:03:24.700> okay<00:03:26.500> so

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500

not<00:03:33.680> much<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:34.280> but<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.670> don't<00:03:34.850> think<00:03:34.970> they

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
not much to this but I don't think they

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.500 
not much to this but I don't think they
even<00:03:35.240> had<00:03:35.480> gas<00:03:35.720> gauges<00:03:36.050> in<00:03:36.350> these<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.770> was<00:03:36.860> just
