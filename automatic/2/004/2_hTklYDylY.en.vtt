00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
mean this play it's pretty complicated

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.820 
mean this play it's pretty complicated
at<00:01:05.269> times<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.810> may<00:01:05.840> take<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.289> several<00:01:06.530> tries

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
at times it may take you several tries

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.070 
at times it may take you several tries
as<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.640> took<00:01:07.759> me<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.420> all<00:01:08.539> you<00:01:08.630> want<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.840> do<00:01:08.960> is

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
as it took me but all you want to do is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.870 
as it took me but all you want to do is
keep<00:01:09.289> jumping<00:01:09.800> over<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.280> over<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.610> get<00:01:10.759> to

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
keep jumping over and over and get to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.790 
keep jumping over and over and get to
the<00:01:10.970> corner<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.330> just<00:01:11.539> got<00:01:11.690> into<00:01:11.929> and<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.619> just

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
the corner I just got into and I just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.800 
the corner I just got into and I just
did<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.009> perfectly<00:01:13.429> my<00:01:13.640> first<00:01:13.910> try<00:01:14.149> them<00:01:14.360> but

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
did it perfectly my first try them but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.910 
did it perfectly my first try them but
I've<00:01:14.929> been<00:01:15.050> trying<00:01:15.289> this<00:01:15.410> for<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.590> few<00:01:15.740> times

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
I've been trying this for a few times

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.880 
I've been trying this for a few times
now<00:01:16.190> so<00:01:16.399> basically<00:01:17.210> it's<00:01:17.750> rewind<00:01:18.319> us<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.530> bit

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
now so basically it's rewind us a bit

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.180 
now so basically it's rewind us a bit
they<00:01:19.280> just<00:01:19.700> watch<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:20.890> try<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.099> to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
they just watch and then try and get to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.339 
they just watch and then try and get to
the<00:01:22.220> exact<00:01:22.580> corner<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.060> diagon<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.959> you

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:24.349 
the exact corner I diagon to and you

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.040 
the exact corner I diagon to and you
will<00:01:24.500> bypass<00:01:24.740> T<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:26.209> barriers<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.869> you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
will bypass T and the barriers and you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.960 
will bypass T and the barriers and you
will<00:01:27.200> not<00:01:27.289> be<00:01:27.349> killed<00:01:27.709> now<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.310> course<00:01:28.369> just<00:01:28.789> be
