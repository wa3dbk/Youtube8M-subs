00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.450
 how about all 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.990
 in this video I'm going to give a little 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.389
 news that is that I created a second channel 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.240
 who can find it in the part 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.940
 upper right of the golden channel 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.790
 silver this channel is dedicated to 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.460
 minecraft do you like minecraft if I like 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.110
 minecraft but I am not a child in rat 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.150
 calm, I'm just going to 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.220
 use to do tutorials adventures 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.800
 or other things that you those that 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.750
 like minecraft, can you suggest me or 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.470
 you do not like minecraft, do not visit 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 the page and nothing happens those games are going 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.730
 to be a little bit longer maybe 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.840
 about 10 15 up to 20 minutes if I 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.050
 fancy or that depends and the second 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.970
 news is good is not news is 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.360
 a little doubt that a subscriber has 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.640
 of my channel and is that the gear club 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.590
 It will probably look bad when it does 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.120
 the left left turn right 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.490
 if I explain this edge or if the 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.729
 cube when you solve it is like this 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.079
 is because this edge any of these 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.420
 edges are wrong I explain myself because 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.549
 they are bad if they are well placed there 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.350
 the truth is not well placed there 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.970
 is there to the ideal 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 some that is wrong explain me is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.549
 these are edges 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.290
 and these are corners 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:45.110
 then this 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.040
 It is an edge if I explain edges 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.040
 corners 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.030
 and this is an edge but clear as 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.549
 this edge is from a normal cube has 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.789
 two stickers instead this one that's from 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.549
 of gear club only has one therefore 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.479
 we do not know if this was well oriented 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.310
 in the event that you get out and 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.360
 he is only talking to you 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.790
 the subscriber or good for all those who 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.430
 have that doubt if you have this like this is 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.460
 because you have this list wrong then 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.720
 what you should do for example 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.160
 in the case of the normal cube 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.600
 if that happens to you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.560
 is to see that I put it wrong 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.220
 because 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.850
 the edge that can be here 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.630
 this one in this state is wrong and if 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.270
 you try to solve it in this way to see 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.270
 and he tried to solve it that way 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.280
 perfect then clear an edge comes out 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.140
 bad that is this and an edge that is this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.660
 but you can not see it because it has a sticker 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.120
 then what you should do is take it out 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.460
 if not, you can follow me 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.270
 Move out 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.840
 Orient the corner again 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.840
 Y 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.680
 guide it as it is you should see a 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.080
 line because if you see only this like this 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.799
 then it is wrong then in the case 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.840
 of the best newspaper in the case of fisher 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.989
 the cube fisher 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.310
 well here a lid fell in the case 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.920
 of the co-official officers that follow there are many 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.780
 times and then that's why I leave it there and 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:49.739
 then you should leave it in this position 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.069
 and put it in this way put the piece if it passes 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.530
 this then reverses is the movement 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.110
 and you do not put it here but you move it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.110
 here and you do the movement but the other way around 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.940
 you do this like this and what happens 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.280
 to see that I am color blind in this camera 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.800
 is that I'm looking in the camera and not 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.650
 I can see well then, what if I 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.560
 you went from here you can go wrong 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.100
 so if it goes wrong it reverses is the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.600
 algorithm and you put it in another side 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.810
 and you put the edge 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:34.050
 well I think to see it put it well 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.570
 that soon by example I left it wrong yes 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.370
 or yes I left it wrong then that's why 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:44.600
 so here is the edge 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.260
 I put it here I put it on the other hand 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.260
 A) Yes 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.130
 and here can happen these things happen to you 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.130
 only this line must leave a 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.710
 cross or something or a line or just the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.900
 point then clear you must have a 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.900
 wrong edge then you take it out 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.849
 put only the corner 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.770
 Y 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.990
 You take this edge and put it on another 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.150
 side 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.300
 and so it will come out to you or if you do the 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.310
 algorithm with the edge here that is with 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.060
 the edge here and the place and you have left 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.090
 bad this is this part then 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.580
 reverts the algorithm and transfers this 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.860
 edge up here and you make the movement 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.790
 from here and so automatically you 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.830
 the fisher cube will come out as normal if 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.920
 you bought it unarmed as it is likely 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.060
 that some piece has modified it and 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:52.140
 jazz and something that had to wrong in given 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:56.160
 case yes if it still does not happen then 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.190
 you catch take q and disarm take it away 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.400
 and the piece is then replaced 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.430
 basically that then I hope that you 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.470
 the suggestion has been served, that is the 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.020
 explanation since I show it in the 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.540
 videos because practically with this already 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.000
 I already have the second explanation video 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.450
 even a subscriber and then I think 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 something good because I do not know if it's going to 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.110
 see if you understand by text then 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.890
 I explain it to you by the text 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.270
 if suddenly I can not explain you with 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.910
 words with the text simply because 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.190
 I'm going to make a video and you can see it 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.290
 and you can understand it much better 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.030
 so good here I am already solving 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.470
 the end of the cube 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.350
 unless on the lower left 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.750
 go up right I say so do it 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.210
 bad can also happen then good 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.030
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.720
 I invite you to watch the channel the new 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.720
 minecraft channel 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.670
 I probably have a little bit of bad 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.670
 quality because I'm recording it from 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:10.639
 of atuc to be from a program and normal 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.620
 but probably better in that editor 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.449
 video I hope you liked the 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.600
 video and see you next time until 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.600
 then
