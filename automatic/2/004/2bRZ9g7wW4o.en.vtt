 It's a delicious candy but it still mixes with this ice cream 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.930
 I thought it was intense Yamada in a short while, but it's surprisingly cold and I don't feel so sweet 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.460
 It is easy to eat from outside Yes I cut it with a kitchen knife now 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.380
 Therefore it Te This is a good cross-section 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:20.770

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.760
 Yes, I've come up the ice to move the current self-made but 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:27.790
 The point is that it is funny to say that the paper cup is full 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.510
 Always sweets El in even get to eat anywhere 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.940
 This feeling of satisfaction after'd got made of paper cups and disposable chopsticks 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.020

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:42.860

 The Somehow this Ukore such Kuke 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:28.560
 You can take some air from the right and take it from the left 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.350
 I think it's okay to take out little by little because I have Martha, but I'm going to make the air thinner 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:38.590
 Right? 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:43.540

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.370
 I wonder if I can do it, I also play cards when playing cards, and when I 'm blowing, I also use mouse-pen

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:04.160
 I used to say that the trombone was about 3 days trumpet trumpet 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.210
