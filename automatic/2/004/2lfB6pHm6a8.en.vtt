or ugly don't worry about it because

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.370 
or ugly don't worry about it because
some<00:01:08.030> sheet<00:01:08.240> metal<00:01:08.360> cover<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:08.870> up<00:01:09.050> anyway<00:01:09.350> so

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
some sheet metal cover that up anyway so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.230 
some sheet metal cover that up anyway so
let's<00:01:09.890> go<00:01:09.980> ahead<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.220> chop<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:10.730> off<00:01:10.940> and

let's go ahead and chop this off and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.660 
let's go ahead and chop this off and
then<00:01:11.300> what<00:01:11.720> would<00:01:11.810> be<00:01:11.930> right<00:01:12.110> back<00:01:12.640> okay<00:01:13.640> I

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
then what would be right back okay I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.040 
then what would be right back okay I
finished<00:01:13.880> cutting<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.390> off<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:14.600> took<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
finished cutting that off just took a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.320 
finished cutting that off just took a
minute<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.770> then<00:01:16.160> make<00:01:16.550> sure<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.300> a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
minute and then make sure that this is a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.300 
minute and then make sure that this is a
little<00:01:17.630> bit<00:01:17.780> below<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.200> surface<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:18.890> or

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
little bit below the surface to this or

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.340 
little bit below the surface to this or
just<00:01:19.850> flush<00:01:20.090> because<00:01:20.780> once<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.110> put<00:01:21.260> our

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
just flush because once you put our

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.540 
just flush because once you put our
sheet<00:01:21.560> metal<00:01:21.740> over<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.920> top<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:22.280> don't<00:01:22.430> want

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
sheet metal over the top we don't want

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.700 
sheet metal over the top we don't want
that<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.880> stick<00:01:23.090> up<00:01:23.240> there<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:23.780> anyway<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.590> can

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
that to stick up there so anyway you can

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.590 
that to stick up there so anyway you can
always<00:01:24.800> grind<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.280> little<00:01:25.490> bit<00:01:25.580> later<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
always grind that a little bit later and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.000 
always grind that a little bit later and
then<00:01:26.720> what<00:01:27.080> I've<00:01:27.200> done<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.470> I've<00:01:27.620> put<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.830> piece

then what I've done is I've put a piece

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.650 
then what I've done is I've put a piece
of<00:01:28.040> tape<00:01:28.160> here<00:01:28.520> about<00:01:28.880> even<00:01:29.240> with<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.420> where

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
of tape here about even with the where

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.290 
of tape here about even with the where
this<00:01:29.810> little<00:01:30.020> radius<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:30.800> this<00:01:31.670> flange
