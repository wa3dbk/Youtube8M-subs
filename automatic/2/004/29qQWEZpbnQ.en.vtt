00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.199
 the speech is 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.209
 OLO 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.809
 it would become more difficult percent in the merkur-arena then there was one 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:46.429
 winner 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.340
 TuS ErndtebrÃ¼ck "We have the IOC 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.790
 Berlin was the 31 games won and then even older can be there 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.919
 also under the hammer 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.130
 Everything fits 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.510
 played well at yesterday's game because only a limited percentage like little 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.669
 People we have 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.039
 and in total 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.979
 For us, the first time that we bring our performance is that 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.809
 especially fits the Herforder and took Paul Auster w 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.059
 as I said everything perfect 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.919
 there was only one quirk almost as a GWD 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.919
 threatened two too 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.570
 have come and there I have already noticed a bit that you 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.999
 They say that she ran out of energy. Hard preparation comes along 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.860
 the murder preparation guests had to play every 60 minutes 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.620
 Elena Walter too 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.610
 and that would be super trouper but you have to say so 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.720
 I totally esteem a second league if you do not use the SEO pin number 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.129
 she neither 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.199
 McLaren has become close to us works which must be caught quite well 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.509
 and still relatively sovereign 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.610
 So once a player has come back to google-ceo he'll give her 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.030
 Of course, completely different league differently more open spaces and 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.699
 I always have to take the responsibility all by myself 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.949
 mostly in the middle of the netbook, it just makes it super fun, son 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.729
 intelligent 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.090
 as player on meters half left has with him extremely 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.710
 Barack's tenth Torgefahr 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.069
 our doing that 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.189
 not only for me for the rest, percent also both percent 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.400
 undershot 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.360
 Here it is relatively far are it if you are these two days there works very well 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.009
 very much 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.389
 who the position on the 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.960
 he does not expect to finish until I see him alone at the moment 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.009
 Do you also care that something happens to him? 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.009
 yes, I think that Christian will come back soon 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.699
 took a really good troupe really wet but tongue to see 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.150
 despite the injured that was that 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.139
 can play well if the rest is synonymous so I think then learned about it 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.529
 and the roles first 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.529
 how are you going forward? 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.400
 a play in the meantime separate again 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.539
 No he clearly 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.939
 three weeks ago over with four games more macs weekend started to me 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.860
 but again against Gummersbach and 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.069
 what I followed so or further and I think but always optimally 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.020
 Be prepared for the first score game 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.660
 I wish you good luck and keep it up
