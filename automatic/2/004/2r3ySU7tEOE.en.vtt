it has been confirmed that more brothers
you<00:00:45.090> kill<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.289> better<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> chance<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you kill the the better the chance of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
you kill the the better the chance of
you<00:00:47.070> getting<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.370> drop<00:00:47.640> from<00:00:48.180> barrows<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.930> was

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you getting a drop from barrows it was

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
you getting a drop from barrows it was
confirmed<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.680> long<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:50.100> ago<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.340> six

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
confirmed a long time ago that six

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.240 
confirmed a long time ago that six
brothers<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.230> sixteen<00:00:52.620> drop<00:00:52.860> rate<00:00:53.070> for

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
brothers is one in sixteen drop rate for

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
brothers is one in sixteen drop rate for
any<00:00:53.370> bears<00:00:53.610> item<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.989> seems<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.590> drop

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
any bears item and it seems like my drop

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160 
any bears item and it seems like my drop
rates<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> twelve<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.420> seven<00:00:57.840> on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
rates like one in twelve with seven on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
rates like one in twelve with seven on
the<00:00:58.590> forums<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.100> Jayma<00:00:59.399> did<00:00:59.670> confirm<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.120> if

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the forums of Jayma did confirm that if

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
the forums of Jayma did confirm that if
you<00:01:00.870> kill<00:01:01.050> accros<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.739> does<00:01:01.980> increase<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you kill accros I it does increase the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
you kill accros I it does increase the
chance<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> barrows<00:01:03.539> item<00:01:03.809> originally<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
chance of a barrows item originally it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
chance of a barrows item originally it
didn't<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.729> patched<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.270> when

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
didn't and then they patched it when

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.120 
didn't and then they patched it when
they<00:01:06.689> realized<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.409> wasn't<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> game's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
they realized it wasn't in the game's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.480 
they realized it wasn't in the game's
code<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:10.020> fixed<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.770> yes<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.189> now

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
code and they fixed that so yes it's now

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
code and they fixed that so yes it's now
in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> game's<00:01:11.909> code<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:12.780> kill

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
in the game's code so if you do kill

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.240 
in the game's code so if you do kill
seven<00:01:13.320> brothers<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.950> better<00:01:14.159> chance

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
seven brothers you have a better chance

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
seven brothers you have a better chance
of<00:01:14.520> any<00:01:14.790> barrows<00:01:15.630> items<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of any barrows items not just the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
of any barrows items not just the
accuracy<00:01:17.189> pieces<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.180> why<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.479> killing

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
accuracy pieces that's why I'm killing

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.969 
accuracy pieces that's why I'm killing
it<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> better<00:01:19.320> chance<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.710> drops

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it so I have a better chance of drops

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.700 
it so I have a better chance of drops
all<00:01:20.189> around<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.119> might<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.509> faster<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.380> do

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
all around it might be faster to just do

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
all around it might be faster to just do
six<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> won't<00:01:23.759> ever<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.270> accros

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
six because then I won't ever get accros

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
six because then I won't ever get accros
i<00:01:24.750> things<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> thing<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
i things like that but the thing is I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
i things like that but the thing is I

pretty quick and I went on to the rest
of<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.340> chests<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.940> then<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.599> did<00:02:17.989> get<00:02:18.200> a

Derrick's plate body which I was

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.880 
Derrick's plate body which I was
initially<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.170> happy<00:02:21.440> about<00:02:21.530> because<00:02:21.830> I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
initially really happy about because I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.589 
initially really happy about because I
thought<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.099> didn't<00:02:22.400> get<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.090> apparently<00:02:23.480> I

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
thought I didn't get it but apparently I

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.910 
thought I didn't get it but apparently I
already<00:02:23.720> had<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.230> from<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> second<00:02:24.770> episode

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
already had it from the second episode

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.120 
already had it from the second episode
so<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.390> also<00:02:26.599> kind<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> lame<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.770> I'm<00:02:28.010> not

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
so that is also kind of lame but I'm not

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.009 
so that is also kind of lame but I'm not
gonna<00:02:28.280> complain<00:02:28.459> because<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.090> around<00:02:29.270> 400<00:02:29.810> K

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
gonna complain because it's around 400 K

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
and I think that's pretty decent for a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.300 
and I think that's pretty decent for a
barrows<00:02:32.030> item<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.800> yeah<00:02:33.800> if<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.130> get<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.740 
barrows item and yeah if I get a
Derrick's<00:02:34.640> item<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.970> shouldn't<00:02:35.239> be<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.480> mad

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
Derrick's item I shouldn't be that mad

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.030 
Derrick's item I shouldn't be that mad
to<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.290> honest<00:02:36.590> because<00:02:36.650> they're<00:02:36.920> all

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
to be honest because they're all

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
looks like I got 39 mill and that is

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.069 
looks like I got 39 mill and that is
kind<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.829> weird<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.459> think<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.690> would<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:09.049> a

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
kind of weird I think that I would be a

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.840 
kind of weird I think that I would be a
little<00:04:09.380> bit<00:04:09.500> more<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.549> seems<00:04:10.730> that

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
little bit more but it just seems that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.059 
little bit more but it just seems that
things<00:04:11.209> probably<00:04:11.450> have<00:04:11.690> been<00:04:11.810> dropping<00:04:12.230> it

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
things probably have been dropping it

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.440 
things probably have been dropping it
looks<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.459> miners<00:04:13.790> have<00:04:14.030> dropped<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
looks like the miners have dropped the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.860 
looks like the miners have dropped the
one<00:04:14.600> GP<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.049> they<00:04:15.200> used<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.500> have

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
one GP that they used to have

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.349 
one GP that they used to have
boat<00:04:17.410> racks<00:04:17.680> dropped<00:04:18.220> totals<00:04:19.030> pretty<00:04:19.239> much

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
boat racks dropped totals pretty much

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.090 
boat racks dropped totals pretty much
every<00:04:19.660> item<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.290> I'm<00:04:20.410> seeing<00:04:20.620> right<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:20.829> has

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
every item that I'm seeing right now has

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.420

100k per chest now so that is kind of
cool<00:05:05.800> because<00:05:06.069> I'm<00:05:06.370> expecting<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.969> series<00:05:07.270> to

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
cool because I'm expecting the series to

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.260 
cool because I'm expecting the series to
be<00:05:07.509> around<00:05:07.750> 1,500<00:05:08.469> chests<00:05:08.889> so<00:05:09.639> I<00:05:09.669> mean<00:05:10.030> if<00:05:10.150> it

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
be around 1,500 chests so I mean if it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.260 
be around 1,500 chests so I mean if it
is<00:05:10.389> like<00:05:10.539> let's<00:05:10.900> say<00:05:11.020> 100<00:05:11.409> K<00:05:11.560> each<00:05:12.090> chest<00:05:13.090> on

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
is like let's say 100 K each chest on

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.879 
is like let's say 100 K each chest on
average<00:05:13.599> that's<00:05:13.779> 150<00:05:14.409> mil<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:14.680> I'm<00:05:14.800> gonna

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.700 
chests are not hard for me to do I could
do<00:06:18.939> that<00:06:19.089> in<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.419> night<00:06:19.599> or<00:06:19.900> like<00:06:20.199> on<00:06:20.319> a<00:06:20.349> stream

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
do that in a night or like on a stream

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.399 
do that in a night or like on a stream
so<00:06:21.039> it's<00:06:21.879> not<00:06:22.000> really<00:06:22.300> hard<00:06:22.539> for<00:06:22.750> me<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:22.990> do<00:06:23.139> two

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
so it's not really hard for me to do two

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.869 
so it's not really hard for me to do two
or<00:06:23.529> three<00:06:23.560> a<00:06:23.710> week<00:06:23.919> it's<00:06:24.129> just<00:06:24.189> that<00:06:24.430> because<00:06:24.849> I

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
or three a week it's just that because I

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.659 
or three a week it's just that because I
only<00:06:25.120> upload<00:06:25.539> every<00:06:26.529> two<00:06:26.680> days<00:06:26.830> it's<00:06:27.189> kind<00:06:27.490> of

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
only upload every two days it's kind of

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.390 
only upload every two days it's kind of
like<00:06:28.419> sometimes<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:29.050> have<00:06:29.289> too<00:06:29.560> much<00:06:29.740> barrows

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
like sometimes I have too much barrows

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.730 
like sometimes I have too much barrows
like<00:06:30.879> that<00:06:31.569> I've<00:06:31.689> done<00:06:31.900> that<00:06:32.169> I<00:06:32.349> can't<00:06:32.620> really

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
like that I've done that I can't really

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.950 
like that I've done that I can't really
upload<00:06:33.099> it<00:06:33.219> that<00:06:33.339> constant<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.449> I<00:06:34.539> don't<00:06:34.779> want

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
upload it that constant and I don't want

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.929 
upload it that constant and I don't want
to<00:06:35.020> give<00:06:35.139> you<00:06:35.289> double<00:06:36.099> barrows<00:06:36.400> videos<00:06:36.729> so<00:06:36.909> I

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
to give you double barrows videos so I

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.629 
to give you double barrows videos so I
always<00:06:37.180> try<00:06:37.449> to<00:06:37.479> fill<00:06:37.719> in<00:06:37.839> a<00:06:37.930> video<00:06:38.189> in<00:06:39.189> between

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
always try to fill in a video in between

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.279 
always try to fill in a video in between
so<00:06:39.849> the<00:06:39.969> max<00:06:40.150> I<00:06:40.270> can<00:06:40.419> really<00:06:40.659> do<00:06:40.779> is<00:06:40.900> three<00:06:41.139> per

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
so the max I can really do is three per

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.769 
so the max I can really do is three per
