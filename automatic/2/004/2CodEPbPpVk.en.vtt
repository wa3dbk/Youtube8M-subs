00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.300 

all<00:00:01.439> right<00:00:01.589> now<00:00:01.709> we<00:00:01.800> need<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.250> about

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
all right now we need to talk about

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.420 
all right now we need to talk about
dividing<00:00:02.820> decimals<00:00:03.170> now<00:00:04.170> before<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:04.740> get<00:00:05.370> into

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
dividing decimals now before we get into

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.460 
dividing decimals now before we get into
the<00:00:05.700> decimal<00:00:06.150> part<00:00:06.359> let's<00:00:06.660> just<00:00:06.870> review<00:00:07.290> our

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the decimal part let's just review our

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.150 
the decimal part let's just review our
terminology<00:00:07.980> for<00:00:08.429> division<00:00:09.410> remember<00:00:10.410> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
terminology for division remember the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.459 
terminology for division remember the
number<00:00:11.550> inside<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.300> house<00:00:12.480> top<00:00:12.840> there<00:00:13.230> is

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
number inside the house top there is

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.160 
number inside the house top there is
called<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.980> dividend<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:15.540> what's<00:00:15.839> being

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
called the dividend it's what's being

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.750 
called the dividend it's what's being
divided<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:18.240> number<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:18.930> dividing

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
divided the number that we are dividing

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.410 
divided the number that we are dividing
into<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> dividend<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> called<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> divisor

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
into the dividend is called the divisor

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.220 
into the dividend is called the divisor
our<00:00:24.420> answer<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.710> called<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.189> quotient<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.480> if

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
our answer is called the quotient and if

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.230 
our answer is called the quotient and if
it<00:00:28.410> doesn't<00:00:28.769> divide<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.220> evenly<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.060> happen

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it doesn't divide in evenly if we happen

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.179 
it doesn't divide in evenly if we happen
to<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.570> something<00:00:30.900> left<00:00:31.199> over<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.980> call

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to have something left over then we call

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.530 
to have something left over then we call
that<00:00:32.219> our<00:00:32.460> remainder<00:00:33.710> okay<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.000> keep<00:00:36.390> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that our remainder okay so just keep in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.040 
that our remainder okay so just keep in
mind<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.989> terminology<00:00:38.420> when<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> comes<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
mind that terminology when it comes to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.160 
mind that terminology when it comes to
dividing<00:00:40.590> decimals<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:42.120> thing<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
dividing decimals the thing you have to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.520 
dividing decimals the thing you have to
remember<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.910> only<00:00:44.940> divide<00:00:45.870> by<00:00:46.230> whole

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
remember is that we only divide by whole

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.709 
remember is that we only divide by whole
numbers<00:00:47.750> now<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> means<00:00:49.829> our<00:00:50.039> divisor

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
numbers now so that means our divisor

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
numbers now so that means our divisor
must<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> whole<00:00:52.320> number<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.420> divisor<00:00:55.820> must

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
must be a whole number so divisor must

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.139 
must be a whole number so divisor must
be<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> whole<00:00:57.360> number

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
be a whole number

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.100 
be a whole number
just<00:01:00.149> put<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.510> mark<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
just put a little mark there for that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
just put a little mark there for that
once<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.409> know<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:05.129> dividing<00:01:05.909> by<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
once we know that we're dividing by a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.350 
once we know that we're dividing by a
whole<00:01:06.960> number<00:01:07.340> then<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.700> line<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.030> our

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
whole number then we just line up our

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.280 
whole number then we just line up our
decimals<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.229> divide<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.189> normal<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.290> let's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
decimals and divide as normal so let's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
decimals and divide as normal so let's
do<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> practice<00:01:14.189> problem<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.600> we

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
do a practice problem here and see if we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.850 
do a practice problem here and see if we
can<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.170> what's<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.880> here<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.030> have

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
can see what's going on here we have

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.810 
can see what's going on here we have
twenty-seven<00:01:19.860> point<00:01:21.470> 3/7<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.280> our<00:01:23.400> divisor

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
twenty-seven point 3/7 so our divisor

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
twenty-seven point 3/7 so our divisor
here<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> whole<00:01:25.140> number<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:25.799> exactly

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
here is a whole number that's exactly

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.330 
here is a whole number that's exactly
what<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.970> need<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:28.140> long<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> divisor<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
what we need as long as the divisor is a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.789 
what we need as long as the divisor is a
whole<00:01:29.579> number<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.049> line<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.380> our

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
whole number we just line up our

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.999 
whole number we just line up our
decimals<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.810> ignore<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
decimals and then we ignore them and we

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
decimals and then we ignore them and we
just<00:01:35.220> start<00:01:35.400> dividing<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.720> just

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
just start dividing like it was just

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.249 
just start dividing like it was just
plain<00:01:37.020> numbers<00:01:37.850> seven<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.270> 27<00:01:40.020> 3

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
plain numbers seven will go into 27 3

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.660 
plain numbers seven will go into 27 3
times<00:01:40.729> 3<00:01:41.729> times<00:01:41.909> 7<00:01:42.090> would<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.600> 21<00:01:43.430> when<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.549> do

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
times 3 times 7 would be 21 when we do

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.039 
times 3 times 7 would be 21 when we do
the<00:01:44.790> subtraction<00:01:45.470> at<00:01:46.729> 27-21<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.119> 6<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the subtraction at 27-21 would be 6 and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.770 
the subtraction at 27-21 would be 6 and
then<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.590> drop<00:01:49.829> our<00:01:50.040> next<00:01:50.340> digit<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:51.360> beginning

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
then we drop our next digit on beginning

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
then we drop our next digit on beginning
in<00:01:52.280> 7<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.610> into<00:01:53.759> 63<00:01:54.570> 9<00:01:55.020> times<00:01:55.790> 9<00:01:56.790> times<00:01:57.119> 7

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
in 7 will go into 63 9 times 9 times 7

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
in 7 will go into 63 9 times 9 times 7
is<00:01:57.689> 63<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:59.420> it<00:02:00.420> goes<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.350> evenly<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.189> no

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
is 63 and it goes in evenly there is no

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.830 
is 63 and it goes in evenly there is no
remainder<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.180> our<00:02:04.110> answer<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.100> be

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
remainder so our answer here would be

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.139 
remainder so our answer here would be
3.9<00:02:06.890> now<00:02:07.890> remember<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.610> always<00:02:08.910> check

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
3.9 now remember you can always check

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.500 
3.9 now remember you can always check
your<00:02:09.899> answer<00:02:10.349> by<00:02:11.099> going<00:02:11.129> backwards<00:02:11.700> doing

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
your answer by going backwards doing

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.500 
your answer by going backwards doing
education<00:02:13.489> if<00:02:14.489> we<00:02:14.580> wanted<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> check<00:02:15.269> our

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
education if we wanted to check our

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.250 
education if we wanted to check our
answer<00:02:15.840> we'd<00:02:15.989> have<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> multiply<00:02:16.760> 3.9<00:02:17.760> times<00:02:18.659> 7

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
answer we'd have to multiply 3.9 times 7

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.259 
answer we'd have to multiply 3.9 times 7
and<00:02:19.379> if<00:02:19.530> we've<00:02:19.709> done<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.980> correctly<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:21.239> should

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
and if we've done it correctly we should

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.130 
and if we've done it correctly we should
get<00:02:21.900> 27<00:02:22.530> point<00:02:22.950> three<00:02:23.189> is<00:02:23.340> our<00:02:23.489> answer<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.150> here

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
get 27 point three is our answer so here

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.429 
get 27 point three is our answer so here
seven<00:02:25.530> times<00:02:25.769> nine<00:02:26.010> would<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.370> 63<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:28.019> I'm

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
seven times nine would be 63 so I'm

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.610 
seven times nine would be 63 so I'm
going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> carry<00:02:29.069> my<00:02:29.250> six<00:02:30.079> seven<00:02:31.079> times<00:02:31.290> three

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
going to carry my six seven times three

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.800 
going to carry my six seven times three
would<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.980> 21<00:02:32.810> plus<00:02:33.810> six<00:02:34.230> would<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.489> 27<00:02:35.489> and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
would be 21 plus six would be 27 and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.270 
would be 21 plus six would be 27 and
then<00:02:36.810> remember<00:02:37.379> we<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.890> deal<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.069> our

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
then remember we have to deal with our

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.009 
then remember we have to deal with our
decimals<00:02:38.730> last<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:41.069> decimal<00:02:41.609> place

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
decimals last this is one decimal place

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.460 
decimals last this is one decimal place
this<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.290> zero<00:02:43.799> decimal<00:02:44.280> places<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.750> my<00:02:45.930> answer

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
this is zero decimal places so my answer

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.690 
this is zero decimal places so my answer
must<00:02:46.799> have<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.730> decimal<00:02:48.150> place<00:02:48.569> in<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:50.549> my

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
must have one decimal place in it so my

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.789 
must have one decimal place in it so my
answer<00:02:51.000> would<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.180> 27<00:02:51.900> point<00:02:52.139> three<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:52.620> this

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
answer would be 27 point three so this

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.399 
answer would be 27 point three so this
checks<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:54.329> tells<00:02:54.569> us<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:54.959> did<00:02:55.200> our

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
checks this tells us that we did our

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.960 
checks this tells us that we did our
division<00:02:55.980> correctly<00:02:57.829> now<00:02:58.829> what<00:02:59.280> about<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.940> we

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
division correctly now what about if we

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.990 
division correctly now what about if we
had<00:03:00.450> something<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.409> looked<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:01.799> this<00:03:02.250> one

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
had something that looked like this one

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.619 
had something that looked like this one
point<00:03:03.329> six<00:03:03.599> two<00:03:03.900> over<00:03:04.530> six<00:03:05.060> well<00:03:06.060> remember<00:03:06.599> a

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
point six two over six well remember a

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.530 
point six two over six well remember a
fraction<00:03:07.049> is<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:08.280> nothing<00:03:08.639> more<00:03:08.909> than<00:03:09.420> a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
fraction is really nothing more than a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.770 
fraction is really nothing more than a
compact<00:03:10.290> division<00:03:10.950> problem<00:03:11.569> we<00:03:12.569> could

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
compact division problem we could

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.550 
compact division problem we could
rewrite<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.650> using<00:03:14.010> division<00:03:15.139> to<00:03:16.139> rewrite

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
rewrite this using division to rewrite

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.740 
rewrite this using division to rewrite
it<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:16.919> one<00:03:17.220> point<00:03:17.519> 6<00:03:17.910> 2<00:03:18.440> divided<00:03:19.440> by<00:03:19.470> 6<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:21.180> now

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
it as one point 6 2 divided by 6 and now

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.140 
it as one point 6 2 divided by 6 and now
we<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:22.049> actually<00:03:22.230> see<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> division

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
we can actually see that as a division

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.289 
we can actually see that as a division
problem<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.930> begin<00:03:25.739> working<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.459> our

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
problem and begin working with it our

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.559 
problem and begin working with it our
divisor<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.739> whole<00:03:29.160> number<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.790> that's

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
divisor is a whole number and that's

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.839 
divisor is a whole number and that's
what<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.370> we're<00:03:32.549> just<00:03:32.579> going

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
what we have to have so we're just going

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.220 
what we have to have so we're just going
to<00:03:32.910> line<00:03:33.209> up<00:03:33.239> our<00:03:33.569> decimals<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:35.060> begin

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
to line up our decimals and begin

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.740 
to line up our decimals and begin
dividing<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:37.620> normal<00:03:38.099> 6<00:03:38.970> won't<00:03:39.180> go<00:03:39.299> into<00:03:39.449> one

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
dividing as normal 6 won't go into one

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.280 
dividing as normal 6 won't go into one
but<00:03:40.349> 6<00:03:40.620> will<00:03:40.769> go<00:03:40.859> into<00:03:41.010> 16<00:03:41.989> it'll<00:03:42.989> go<00:03:43.079> into

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
but 6 will go into 16 it'll go into

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.189 
but 6 will go into 16 it'll go into
there<00:03:43.440> twice<00:03:44.660> 2<00:03:45.660> times<00:03:45.989> 6<00:03:46.290> would<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.769> 12

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
there twice 2 times 6 would be 12

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.159 
there twice 2 times 6 would be 12
subtract<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.280> let's<00:03:50.519> see<00:03:50.609> 16<00:03:50.940> minus<00:03:51.449> 12<00:03:51.810> would

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
subtract so let's see 16 minus 12 would

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.619 
subtract so let's see 16 minus 12 would
be<00:03:52.230> 4<00:03:53.329> drop<00:03:54.329> our<00:03:54.569> next<00:03:54.930> digit<00:03:55.199> which<00:03:55.409> is<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.769> 2<00:03:56.629> 6

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
be 4 drop our next digit which is a 2 6

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.420 
be 4 drop our next digit which is a 2 6
will<00:03:57.870> go<00:03:58.019> into<00:03:58.169> 42<00:03:58.919> 7<00:03:59.909> times<00:04:00.560> 7<00:04:01.560> times<00:04:01.739> 6<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.370> 42

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
will go into 42 7 times 7 times 6 is 42

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.970 
will go into 42 7 times 7 times 6 is 42
so<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.419> goes<00:04:03.629> in<00:04:03.870> evenly<00:04:04.139> there<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.769> no

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
so it goes in evenly there is no

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.879 
so it goes in evenly there is no
remainder<00:04:05.659> that<00:04:06.659> tells<00:04:06.959> us<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.169> our<00:04:07.349> answer

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
remainder that tells us that our answer

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.800 
remainder that tells us that our answer
here<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.970> point<00:04:09.690> two<00:04:10.349> seven<00:04:11.329> now<00:04:12.329> again

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
here is point two seven now again

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.809 
here is point two seven now again
remember<00:04:13.079> we<00:04:13.470> could<00:04:13.620> always<00:04:13.769> check<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.609> if

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
remember we could always check that if

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.460 
remember we could always check that if
we<00:04:14.970> wanted<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.540> just<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.840> make<00:04:15.989> sure<00:04:16.019> we<00:04:16.320> were

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
we wanted to just to make sure we were

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.159 
we wanted to just to make sure we were
correct<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:17.699> could<00:04:17.909> multiply<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.570> point<00:04:18.989> two

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
correct we could multiply the point two

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.219 
correct we could multiply the point two
seven<00:04:19.500> times<00:04:19.979> 6<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.760> see<00:04:21.419> if<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:21.959> one

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
seven times 6 and see if we get one

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.400 
seven times 6 and see if we get one
point<00:04:22.560> six<00:04:22.919> two

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
point six two

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.870 
point six two
so<00:04:24.280> 0.2<00:04:24.880> 7<00:04:25.540> times<00:04:25.900> 6<00:04:26.790> 6<00:04:27.790> times<00:04:28.090> 7<00:04:28.630> would<00:04:28.750> be<00:04:28.900> 42<00:04:29.880> 6

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
so 0.2 7 times 6 6 times 7 would be 42 6

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.040 
so 0.2 7 times 6 6 times 7 would be 42 6
times<00:04:31.150> 2<00:04:31.360> would<00:04:31.480> be<00:04:31.510> 12<00:04:31.960> 13<00:04:32.500> 14<00:04:32.620> 15<00:04:32.920> 16<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:34.050> here

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
times 2 would be 12 13 14 15 16 and here

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.190 
times 2 would be 12 13 14 15 16 and here
we<00:04:35.170> have<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.500> move<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.800> decimal<00:04:35.950> 2<00:04:36.460> places<00:04:37.200> no

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
we have to move the decimal 2 places no

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.460 
we have to move the decimal 2 places no
places<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.250> that's<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.580> total<00:04:39.910> of<00:04:40.030> 2<00:04:40.300> we<00:04:41.110> move<00:04:41.320> it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
places so that's a total of 2 we move it

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.540 
places so that's a total of 2 we move it
back<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:42.040> 2<00:04:42.400> places<00:04:42.700> we<00:04:43.180> get<00:04:43.330> an<00:04:43.480> answer<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:44.550> 1.6

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
back in 2 places we get an answer of 1.6

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.930 
back in 2 places we get an answer of 1.6
-<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.390> that<00:04:46.420> checks
