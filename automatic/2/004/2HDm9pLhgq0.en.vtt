00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.690
 greetings from our videos 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.760
 whatsapp weekly today we open with 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.620
 nintendo why this week was 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 characterized by some indiscretions 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 that they see as their own protagonist 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 the kyoto company 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 in fact it seems that nintendo is on 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 point to announce two new consoles 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.830
 one named with the code name not 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.170
 definitive fusion of if this is one 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.900
 portable console and the other call 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.240
 fusion terminate this attention is one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.399
 the home console is a little strange 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 because we know nintendo is still in 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.989
 dance in play with his nintendo wii u 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.820
 but just last week ne 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.950
 we talked about things for nintendo wii 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 u are not going so well 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 console sells little does not sell enough 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.760
 the developers are not happy and the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.410
 same nintendo has been dissatisfied 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.180
 so we will see a little how the will go 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 things seems strange that nintendo 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.070
 leave her to devote herself to something else 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 but on the other side of course nintendo 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.350
 wants to put a stone on top of him 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.019
 current failures and look for something 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 new then we will see if this rumor 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.330
 we remember unconfirmed will come 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.760
 actually confirmed and for the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.530
 moment we wait 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.780
 always staying on the subject of rumor and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.619
 nintendo wii u comes from Italy 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.750
 news of watchdog cancellation 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.369
 for nintendo wii u at the moment 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.890
 this news is absolutely not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.619
 confirmed and based on the fact that the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.509
 game has been removed from the catalog of one 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.850
 known distribution chain of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 video games in Italy for the moment in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 rest of europe the game remains in 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.750
 however, the catalog is not even on the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.090
 nintendo site then the mystery a bit 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.229
 it thickens even in this case not 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.040
 we just have to wait for a possible 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.720
 confirm or hopefully denied by 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.850
 ubisoft therefore we remain all to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 next week 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.610
 let's move on to the estimate sheen is now 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280
 three consecutive weeks there 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.770
 we occupy and speak in particular 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.320
 of estimates 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.810
 sheen a mark malware because the note 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.509
 American company stated that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.789
 will release a new sheen estimate per year 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.250
 and that the stigma sheen will not be 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.440
 easily upgradable so not 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.049
 we can disassemble our steam machine 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.670
 branded eyewear and fit into it 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.660
 the hardware we want will be a lot 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.970
 difficult to assemble 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.489
 consequently this means that a 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.950
 really passionate player will have to 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.920
 buy a new china estimate every year 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.330
 and therefore really investing in figures 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.390
 considerable even if you have hauer ha 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.120
 stated that the costs of these steam 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.489
 machines will be comparable to those 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.349
 of the new generation consoles 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.120
 in short, the expense is really considerable 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.160
 imagine yourself around 1,200 euros each 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.049
 three years so so many 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.970
 money the thing obviously did not like 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.290
 the players didn't even like the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.670
 journalists who wrote in 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.510
 last days of the articles really 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.900
 fiery 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.970
 we hope that we change our mind about newer 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.799
 ad assassin's creed because ubisoft has 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.380
 hinted where it could go 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.510
 to finish the series in the next episode 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.389
 better in the next episode yes auction 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.040
 he writes 5 in fact it could be 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.540
 set in feudal Japan 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.400
 ubisoft has indeed stated that this 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.019
 is one of the options being examined by 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.660
 developers and that probably 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.139
 we could see it in the future of this 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.569
 series 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.709
 we believe the fifth episode is already 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.319
 in development so it will already have been 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.970
 definitely decided where the game will be 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.349
 set and probably this one 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.269
 news could be denied but 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.400
 It comes from an official source then 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.290
 we are waiting 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.269
 ubisoft also had a chance to talk 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.099
 of assassin's creed 4 stating that the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.690
 secret of the success of this fourth 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.180
 episode that was applauded by 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.069
 criticism is due both to a lesser development 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.340
 troubled compared to the third episode 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.380
 than to the fact that the company is inspired 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.720
 to some aspects of getting cry 3 for 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.970
 complete this title 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.130
 and the results are seen to have arrived 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.069
 some information about the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.200
 the witcher's map size 3 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.810
 yes yes project red has confirmed 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.810
 that the game map will be bigger 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.250
 20 percent off the map 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.770
 of 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.450
 skyrim what this means that if 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.720
 the skyrim map had a size 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.760
 of about 40 square kilometers that 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.310
 of the witcher 3 should have standing 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.620
 to the accounts a size of about 48 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.350
 square kilometers so still a 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.330
 game really very very important since 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.000
 point of view of this size 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.340
 look beyond the technical aspects of the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.900
 game have actually made it impossible 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.960
 the arrival of the witcher 3 on the consoles 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.040
 old generation 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.020
 finally we close this part of the 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.450
 whatsapp dedicated to news with a 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.190
 I recommend a literary council that 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.430
 in fact we deliver to download e 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.200
 read the free enemy fire book 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.570
 set in the metal gear universe 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 solid and starring meryl silver 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.090
 boy 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.919
 the book was written by us 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.930
 stefania sperandio editor of 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.430
 space games and is also the person who 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.440
 takes care of the texts of this 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.930
 you can find whatsapp for free 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.770
 I repeat on the website www.stefanome.it 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.419
 let's move on to the recessions you find 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.360
 this week on spaceshames e 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.150
 open with dragon ball z battle of zill 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.130
 title that somehow disappointed us 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.870
 due to a technical sector not 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.400
 just up to some and some 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.290
 mechanics that made us turn away 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.580
 the nose and in particular they did 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.560
 gods lovers turn up their noses 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.350
 fighting game because the game was 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.120
 unbalanced by the presence of the parade 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.560
 absolute and from a system of combos that 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.680
 they can practically never be 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.080
 break up much more interesting might 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.150
 and magic hicks legacy it is a 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.100
 great return of a saga that by now is not 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.080
 we had been seeing for over ten years 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.810
 might and magic hicks legacy is a title 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.200
 which, however, is inspired by the titles that have come out 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.760
 before the sixth episode of the saga e 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.260
 so it presents a gameplay that is 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.570
 almost twenty years old 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.610
 the thing is certainly not negative indeed 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.760
 the title is very funny thanks to the 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.440
 its old style gameplay but at the same time the 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.040
 the technical sector in general 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.800
 it is a little below expectations 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.510
 very good also doctor luigi title 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.580
 downloadable for nintendo wii u 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.530
 indeed the game does not present 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.840
 nothing really new 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.730
 but the mechanics are very solid and in the 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.170
 a lot of fun 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.090
 missing multiplayer for four 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.550
 players while excellent the chance 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.290
 to be able to also play on the gamepad that 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.080
 turned out to be perfect for these 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.810
 finally, disappointing game types 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.910
 eagle operation demolished the new dlc 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.030
 for dead rising 3 exclusive title 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.640
 for xbox one at the price of 10 euros in 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.810
 this package is in fact two hours 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.030
 of play 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.760
 five new weapons and a new vehicle 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.860
 in short, it doesn't seem like a big deal to us 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.990
 we believe the developers would have 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.480
 could have done much better especially 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.160
 for the price requested to the players 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.150
 in any case if dead rising trevi is 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.800
 liked to go crazy 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.600
 eagle batting operation could 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.310
 certainly enrich your own 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.720
 experience 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.340
 finally we pass to the videos you find both 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.910
 on spaceships that on our channel 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.010
 youtube 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.090
 in particular we mark the video 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.090
 stryder preview 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:13.470
 the new dance play dedicated to stars 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.470
 bound the videorecensione of black cars 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.960
 also the replay of our live play 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.240
 dedicated to the playstation camera 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.979
 even for today it's all a date with 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.100
 a new whatsapp as always for Saturday 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.100
 next one
