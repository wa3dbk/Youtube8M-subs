00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.600
 good as I had told him we are going to 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.150
 do 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.940
 a tutorial to place mods in the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.219
 minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.620
 all we have to do is 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.859
 download two applications one that would be 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.649
 the blog launcher and another that would be him the 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.989
 application we will find the mods 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.070
 itself in the description of this video 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.070
 We will find 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.240
 the links to download the two 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.560
 applications are totally from 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.440
 free of charge we enter the first to 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.320
 the one from the mods store and here we go to 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.470
 enter mods we put the version of 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 our minecraft pocket edition 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.370
 and here we are going to tell you two options is what 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.650
 same only the second are different mods 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:22.740
 and how can you find a lot of 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.460
 mods that we will be able to find the one that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 the way we like it and we play it and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.490
 directly downloaded in this case 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.160
 I'm going to play this we have that has already 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.290
 downloaded we go back and you 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.120
 we give the block blanchett that the other 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.650
 application that you must download here 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.619
 they have a button which they should 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.060
 touch you give the patch manager and here 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.820
 all the mods that have 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.850
 downloaded could disable the modes 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 that I already had that I'm going to activate 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.200
 this 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.009
 and let's go back 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.920
 and we 're going to play let's go into a 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.920
 survival and we're going to see that this one 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.490
 what it does 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.290
 is 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.069
 we are going to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.829
 there are some modes that do not work like 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.500
 for example this but there are others that yes and 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.980
 let's put the climbing for example is 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.520
 a way that I highly recommend and what 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.400
 that we can be with this 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.620
 jump with feather fall as they can 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.410
 watch 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.720
 and climb walls 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.280
 we see that we jump with lead drop 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.890
 we have jumped from 4 blocks and we did not 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.310
 we have done nothing harm we are going to climb 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060
 what they can see and we jump with nothing 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.250
 Of damage 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 this model that will not invite us is the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.270
 arrival to objects that we have at a 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.000
 certain height with going back out of 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.670
 climb a tree and I can throw myself 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 a very simple way I will leave 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.670
 this server the only thing that has bad 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.080
 this blog launcher application is that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.250
 will have some ads 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.250
 which does not 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.689
 but good 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.660
 I have entered here on a server which 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:33.220
 it costs one so 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.040
 It is full of really high mountains and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.040
 let's climb the all I'm going to climb 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.020
 this mountain from here as you can see is 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.620
 really high and does not have any kind of 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.720
 staircase and I can easily reach up 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.430
 above it 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.950
 we see that I just have to climb 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.459
 and in 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.720
 a few seconds I'm already at the top and 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.670
 how can you see if I want to go down then 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.480
 of the simple pigeons since I tell 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:09.099
 with the fall of pens let's try to 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.099
 place another mode 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.190
 we must find the place where we have 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.769
 there the button 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.310
 we are going to activate this mode and we are going to 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.180
 Activate 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.990
 we deactivate them and here we go this 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.990
 ready 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.000
 how can you see this mode what it does is 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.889
 that we jump much higher than 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.919
 combined with the other one that has falling 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.979
 pen will work better to be that we do not 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.539
 will do as much damage as it has fallen the 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.930
 cross manatee like charles the accountant 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.320
 but it's a pretty good way 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.140
 recommendable 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.110
 If you liked the video do not forget to give me 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.850

 comment if you have any questions about 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.800
 this video about any other my channel 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.110
 I upload videos every day and I ask 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.280
 sorry since these days I could not 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.280
 upload videos 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.759
 why I'm finishing the classes and 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:17.190
 I have some exams which I do not 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:21.420
 leave time for videos 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.400
 and if you follow me on google + the social network 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.210
 of Google 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.610
 and there they will be able to know 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.700
 all about my videos when I will know and 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.180
 all that 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.400
 and good luck today is the last day 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.590
 of exams that I have what I 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.210
 will make it easier to be more videos all 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.440
 days in fact I'm preparing videos 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.650
 for next 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.470
 weeks so well I hope you have 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.090
 liked and that you can easily install 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.980
 the mods to your minecraft pocket edition 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.590
 as I have already told you to remind me 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.600
 like to share it and comment without that one 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.160
 doubt and subscribe if you are new your life 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.760
