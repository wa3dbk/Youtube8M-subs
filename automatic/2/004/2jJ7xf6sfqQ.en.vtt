so<00:00:02.220> we<00:00:02.340> have<00:00:02.490> navigation<00:00:03.210> but<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.629> about

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
so we have navigation but how about

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.259 
so we have navigation but how about
logic<00:00:04.290> linking<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.220> parts<00:00:05.550> of<00:00:05.670> our<00:00:05.790> interface

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:06.269 
logic linking the parts of our interface

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.390 
logic linking the parts of our interface
and<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.689> code<00:00:06.899> behind<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.439> scenes<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.280> that

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
and the code behind the scenes so that

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.490 
and the code behind the scenes so that
our<00:00:08.490> app<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.849> actually<00:00:09.269> do<00:00:09.480> something<00:00:09.750> useful

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
our app can actually do something useful

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.709 
our app can actually do something useful
this<00:00:11.129> might<00:00:11.339> sound<00:00:11.610> simple<00:00:11.879> you've<00:00:12.419> done<00:00:12.629> it

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
this might sound simple you've done it

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.329 
this might sound simple you've done it
before<00:00:12.809> using<00:00:13.379> intelligent<00:00:13.889> editor<00:00:14.190> and

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
before using intelligent editor and

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.090 
before using intelligent editor and
control<00:00:14.940> drag<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> same<00:00:16.500> watchkit

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
control drag and it's the same watchkit

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
control drag and it's the same watchkit
except<00:00:17.790> while<00:00:18.360> your<00:00:18.540> interface<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.110> running

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
except while your interface is running

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.590 
except while your interface is running
on<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> watch<00:00:19.770> your<00:00:20.310> logic<00:00:20.700> is<00:00:20.790> running<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
on the watch your logic is running on a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.050 
on the watch your logic is running on a

completely other device the users iPhone
this<00:00:24.870> does<00:00:25.140> add<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.740> slight<00:00:26.190> level<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.880> extra

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
this does add a slight level of extra

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.780 
this does add a slight level of extra
complication<00:00:28.020> but<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.100> way<00:00:29.250> which<00:00:29.490> kid<00:00:29.760> is

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
complication but the way which kid is

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.030 
complication but the way which kid is
done<00:00:30.030> and<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.360> done<00:00:30.420> very<00:00:30.750> well<00:00:30.780> that's<00:00:31.710> it's

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
done and it's done very well that's it's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.099 
done and it's done very well that's it's
not<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.489> worth<00:00:32.640> worrying<00:00:32.940> about<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.929> let's

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
not really worth worrying about so let's

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.410 
not really worth worrying about so let's
select<00:00:34.289> the<00:00:34.679> original<00:00:34.980> interface<00:00:35.789> controller

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
select the original interface controller

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.410 
select the original interface controller
that<00:00:36.660> Xcode<00:00:37.140> gave<00:00:37.379> us<00:00:37.589> and<00:00:38.149> open<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that Xcode gave us and open the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.520 
that Xcode gave us and open the
intelligent<00:00:39.989> editor<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.600> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
intelligent editor as I have here as you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.959 
intelligent editor as I have here as you
can<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.679> that<00:00:44.039> the<00:00:44.159> interface<00:00:44.550> controller

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
can see that the interface controller

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.970 
can see that the interface controller

runs<00:01:16.710> after<00:01:17.039> your<00:01:17.729> interface<00:01:18.090> disappears<00:01:18.719> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
runs after your interface disappears and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.279 
runs after your interface disappears and
is<00:01:19.560> used<00:01:19.829> to<00:01:20.219> clean<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.850> after<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> user<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
is used to clean up after the user and

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.770 
is used to clean up after the user and
save<00:01:22.560> any<00:01:22.770> information<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.549> both<00:01:24.149> is<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.360> useful

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
save any information so both is a useful

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
save any information so both is a useful
but<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.219> really<00:01:26.399> want<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> do

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
but right now all we really want to do

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.039 
but right now all we really want to do
is<00:01:27.619> connect<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.860> button<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.610> our<00:01:29.640> code<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
is connect a button to our code as you

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.660 
is connect a button to our code as you
can<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.350> I've<00:01:31.500> set<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.799> an<00:01:31.979> interface<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
can see I've set up an interface with a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.719 
can see I've set up an interface with a
button<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.719> label<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.520> select

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
button and a label so first we select

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
button and a label so first we select
this<00:01:36.030> button<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.799> we<00:01:37.799> control<00:01:38.159> drag<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
this button and we control drag from the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.090 
this button and we control drag from the
interface<00:01:40.680> into<00:01:41.310> our<00:01:41.430> code<00:01:42.350> like<00:01:43.350> always<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
interface into our code like always we

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
interface into our code like always we
have<00:01:44.250> outlets<00:01:44.789> and<00:01:44.969> actions<00:01:45.359> we're<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.469> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have outlets and actions we're going to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
have outlets and actions we're going to
select<00:01:46.649> an<00:01:46.890> action<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.549> want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.969> have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
select an action because we want to have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.660 
select an action because we want to have
the<00:01:48.240> action<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.750> button<00:01:49.109> being<00:01:49.259> pressed

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
the action of this button being pressed

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.800 
the action of this button being pressed
now<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.729> type<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.359> button<00:01:52.320> pressed<00:01:53.810> because

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
now we type in button pressed because

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.639 
now we type in button pressed because
that's<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> call<00:01:55.560> my

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that's what I'm going to call my

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.730 
that's what I'm going to call my
function<00:01:55.859> so<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.749> a<00:01:57.810> function<00:01:58.079> we're

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
function so we have a function we're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.749 
function so we have a function we're
going<00:01:58.859> to<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.009> something<00:01:59.249> really<00:01:59.369> simple

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
going to do something really simple

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.800 
going to do something really simple
we're<00:01:59.880> just<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.179> run<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> print<00:02:00.659> line<00:02:02.810> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
we're just going to run a print line and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
we're just going to run a print line and
we're<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.109> print<00:02:04.409> line<00:02:06.140> something<00:02:07.670> up

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
we're gonna print line something up

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.780 
we're gonna print line something up
that's<00:02:08.880> about<00:02:09.149> wrong<00:02:09.360> who<00:02:09.569> cares<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:11.730> we

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that's about wrong who cares so now we

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.970 
that's about wrong who cares so now we
have<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.239> we've<00:02:12.750> linked<00:02:13.200> our<00:02:13.409> interface<00:02:13.800> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
have this we've linked our interface to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.230 
have this we've linked our interface to
our<00:02:14.099> code<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.430> we're<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> build<00:02:14.909> out

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
our code but we're going to build out

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.390 
our code but we're going to build out
and<00:02:15.420> run<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.900> see<00:02:16.020> what<00:02:16.260> happens<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.860> here

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
and run it and see what happens so here

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940 
and run it and see what happens so here
we<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.700> our<00:02:18.170> apple<00:02:19.170> watch<00:02:19.320> simulator<00:02:19.800> we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
we have our apple watch simulator we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
we have our apple watch simulator we
press<00:02:20.190> our<00:02:20.340> button<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.880> couple<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.270> times<00:02:21.510> as

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
press our button a couple of times as

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.260 
press our button a couple of times as
you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.610> each<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.850> those<00:02:23.970> times

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
you can see for each of those times

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.200 
you can see for each of those times
something<00:02:25.050> or<00:02:25.770> my<00:02:26.340> horrible<00:02:26.790> spelling

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
something or my horrible spelling

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.200 
something or my horrible spelling
something<00:02:27.450> my<00:02:27.840> gibberish<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:29.400> printed<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
something my gibberish is printed to the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.860 
something my gibberish is printed to the
console<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.910> actions

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
console so we have actions

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.860 
console so we have actions
how<00:02:34.110> about<00:02:34.290> outlets<00:02:35.330> how<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:36.630> put<00:02:36.780> an

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
how about outlets how that we put an

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.490 
how about outlets how that we put an
outlet<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> label<00:02:38.210> for<00:02:39.440> changing<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
outlet on the label for changing the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.200 
outlet on the label for changing the
text<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.430> we're<00:02:41.550> going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.700> change<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.060> text

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
text and we're going to change the text

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.990 
text and we're going to change the text
from<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.450> buttons<00:02:42.690> press<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.080> we'll<00:02:43.320> drag

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
from the buttons press so we'll drag

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.190 
from the buttons press so we'll drag
this<00:02:46.460> our<00:02:47.460> kid<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:48.300> course<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.960> have<00:02:49.080> no

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
this our kid of course we have no

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.690 
this our kid of course we have no
actions<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.280> an<00:02:50.430> outlet

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
actions on this so it's just an outlet

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.130 
actions on this so it's just an outlet
and<00:02:50.910> let's<00:02:51.480> go<00:02:51.630> label<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.100> our<00:02:53.190> label

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
and let's go label so we have our label

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.930 
and let's go label so we have our label
now<00:02:55.140> how<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:55.740> we<00:02:55.890> change<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> text<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.700> down

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
now how do we change the text so down

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.130 
now how do we change the text so down
here<00:02:57.120> we're<00:02:57.270> gonna<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.600> rid<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.780> our<00:02:57.870> print

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
here we're gonna get rid of our print

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.840 
here we're gonna get rid of our print
line<00:02:58.290> we're<00:02:58.470> gonna<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.770> label<00:02:59.990> dots<00:03:03.710> so

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
line we're gonna go label dots so

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.730 
line we're gonna go label dots so
normally<00:03:05.850> change<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.870> text<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.440> label

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
normally change the text of a label

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.910 
normally change the text of a label
weeks<00:03:07.950> code<00:03:08.220> label<00:03:08.640> dot<00:03:08.850> text<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:10.350> that's<00:03:10.680> not

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
weeks code label dot text but that's not

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.390 
weeks code label dot text but that's not
there<00:03:11.160> because<00:03:12.120> we<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.200> run<00:03:13.440> functions

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
there because we have to run functions

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.050 
there because we have to run functions
to<00:03:14.910> change<00:03:15.300> things<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.610> device<00:03:17.610> because

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
to change things on the device because

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.050 
to change things on the device because
of<00:03:18.180> course<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.900> two<00:03:19.200> device<00:03:19.940> sort<00:03:20.940> of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
of course it's that two device sort of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.390 
of course it's that two device sort of
thing<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.770> function<00:03:23.100> we're<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.340> use

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
thing so the function we're going to use

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.420 
thing so the function we're going to use
is<00:03:23.670> set<00:03:24.090> text<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.350> course<00:03:25.380> sets<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
is set text which of course sets the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.880 
is set text which of course sets the
text<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.360> label<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.590> gonna<00:03:28.680> make

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
text of the label I'm just gonna make

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.160 
text of the label I'm just gonna make
this<00:03:29.570> that's<00:03:30.570> there

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
this that's there

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.350 
this that's there
see<00:03:31.410> I'm<00:03:31.620> original<00:03:32.010> we're<00:03:32.940> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> run<00:03:33.240> out

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
see I'm original we're going to run out

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.510 
see I'm original we're going to run out
up<00:03:33.480> again<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.080> have<00:03:34.290> our<00:03:34.530> button<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.310> when

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
up again so we have our button and when

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.840 
up again so we have our button and when
we<00:03:35.610> press<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.780> changes<00:03:37.290> our<00:03:37.530> label<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.700> that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
we press it it changes our label to that

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.120 
we press it it changes our label to that
gibberish<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.200> final<00:03:40.530> thing<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.800> want<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
gibberish so the final thing I want to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.150 
gibberish so the final thing I want to
do<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.550> create<00:03:41.880> another<00:03:42.000> interface<00:03:42.800> we<00:03:43.800> drag

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
do is create another interface we drag

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.150 
do is create another interface we drag
another<00:03:45.260> interface<00:03:46.260> controller<00:03:46.800> onto<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
another interface controller onto the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.700 
another interface controller onto the
screen<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:47.810> I'm<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:48.960> gonna<00:03:49.080> make<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.440> page

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
screen and I'm just gonna make it a page

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.740 
screen and I'm just gonna make it a page
between<00:03:50.100> these<00:03:50.490> two<00:03:50.700> threads<00:03:50.910> slide<00:03:51.360> between

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
between these two threads slide between

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.930 
between these two threads slide between
them<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.500> normally<00:03:53.130> what<00:03:53.310> would<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.580> do<00:03:53.700> now

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
them so normally what would you do now

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.200 
them so normally what would you do now
you'd<00:03:54.300> make<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.810> class<00:03:55.340> we<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.640> put<00:03:56.910> our

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
you'd make a class we have to put our

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.420 
you'd make a class we have to put our
class<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.780> here<00:03:57.990> in<00:03:58.140> our<00:03:58.260> app<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.860> our<00:03:59.130> watch

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
class up here in our app and our watch

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.490 
class up here in our app and our watch
it's<00:03:59.940> extension<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:02.430> make<00:04:02.610> sure<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
it's extension so to make sure that the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.110 
it's extension so to make sure that the
file<00:04:04.830> goes<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.490> folder<00:04:05.700> we're<00:04:06.000> gonna

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
file goes in this folder we're gonna

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.060

so in this drop-down we want to select
wk<00:04:17.600> interface<00:04:19.400> controller<00:04:20.600> we're<00:04:21.600> gonna<00:04:21.750> call

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
wk interface controller we're gonna call

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.480 
wk interface controller we're gonna call
it<00:04:22.109> second<00:04:24.590> we're<00:04:25.590> gonna<00:04:25.650> create<00:04:25.980> that<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
it second we're gonna create that and

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.030 
it second we're gonna create that and
make<00:04:27.360> sure<00:04:27.390> watch<00:04:28.110> get

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
make sure watch get

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.430 
make sure watch get
attention<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.670> selected<00:04:30.270> because<00:04:31.200> that's

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
attention is selected because that's

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.330 
attention is selected because that's
what<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:31.650> going<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:31.890> part<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.100> it's<00:04:32.250> gonna

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
what it's going to be part of it's gonna

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.980 
what it's going to be part of it's gonna
be<00:04:32.430> part<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.640> our<00:04:32.760> extension<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.840> can

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
be part of our extension so as you can

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.720 
be part of our extension so as you can
see<00:04:34.140> we<00:04:34.410> have<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:35.040> this<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.520> all<00:04:35.640> this

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
see we have this this is all this

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.600 
see we have this this is all this
created<00:04:36.210> because<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:37.050> SDK<00:04:37.650> isn't<00:04:38.220> complete

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
created because the SDK isn't complete

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.030 
created because the SDK isn't complete
yet<00:04:38.640> in<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.450> future<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.960> probably<00:04:40.770> will

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
yet in the future this probably will

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.870 
yet in the future this probably will
change<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.550> definitely<00:04:41.910> will<00:04:42.030> change<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:43.260> if

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
change it definitely will change so if

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.310 
change it definitely will change so if
it<00:04:44.880> looks<00:04:44.910> different<00:04:45.450> from<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:45.780> don't<00:04:46.200> be

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
it looks different from this don't be

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.980 
it looks different from this don't be
shocked<00:04:47.030> but<00:04:48.030> for<00:04:48.420> now<00:04:48.510> we're<00:04:48.660> gonna<00:04:48.720> have<00:04:48.930> to

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
shocked but for now we're gonna have to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.230 
shocked but for now we're gonna have to
control<00:04:49.320> copy<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:50.010> some<00:04:50.220> things<00:04:50.550> over<00:04:50.970> from

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
control copy it some things over from

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.840 
control copy it some things over from
our<00:04:51.480> default<00:04:52.350> interface<00:04:52.710> class<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:53.580> first<00:04:53.760> we

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
our default interface class so first we

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.000 
our default interface class so first we
don't<00:04:54.090> copy<00:04:54.450> over<00:04:54.750> these<00:04:54.870> two<00:04:55.110> imports<00:04:55.800> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
don't copy over these two imports the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.620 
don't copy over these two imports the
two<00:04:56.190> frameworks<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.820> when<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.000> import<00:04:57.360> and

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
two frameworks and when you import and

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.120 
two frameworks and when you import and
replace<00:04:58.530> uikit<00:04:59.370> with<00:05:00.150> those<00:05:00.540> two<00:05:00.780> frameworks

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
replace uikit with those two frameworks

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.680 
replace uikit with those two frameworks
the<00:05:02.130> other<00:05:02.250> thing<00:05:02.460> we<00:05:02.550> need<00:05:02.670> to<00:05:02.700> copy<00:05:02.910> over<00:05:03.860> is

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
the other thing we need to copy over is

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.540 
the other thing we need to copy over is
these<00:05:06.690> three<00:05:07.350> functions<00:05:07.860> that<00:05:10.010> are<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.190> inter

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
these three functions that are the inter

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.270 
these three functions that are the inter
setup<00:05:12.290> will<00:05:13.290> activate<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.340> deactivate<00:05:15.050> and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
setup will activate and deactivate and

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.710 
setup will activate and deactivate and
now<00:05:17.280> just<00:05:17.640> to<00:05:17.760> confirm<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:19.520> this<00:05:20.720> view

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
now just to confirm that this view

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.940 
now just to confirm that this view
controller<00:05:22.050> is<00:05:22.140> activating<00:05:22.650> I'm<00:05:22.710> just<00:05:22.830> going

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
controller is activating I'm just going

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.830 
controller is activating I'm just going
to<00:05:22.980> be<00:05:23.070> a<00:05:23.130> print<00:05:23.370> line<00:05:25.310> did

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
to be a print line did

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.480 
to be a print line did
that's<00:05:28.800> about<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.040> start<00:05:29.250> wrong<00:05:29.400> who<00:05:29.550> cares

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
that's about to start wrong who cares

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.060 
that's about to start wrong who cares
final<00:05:32.490> thing<00:05:32.610> we<00:05:32.700> need<00:05:32.730> to<00:05:32.880> do<00:05:33.030> is<00:05:33.290> link<00:05:34.290> our

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
final thing we need to do is link our

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.750 
final thing we need to do is link our
viewcontroller<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:36.870> our<00:05:37.370> our<00:05:38.370> interface

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
viewcontroller to our our interface

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
viewcontroller to our our interface
controller<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.330> our<00:05:39.450> class<00:05:39.660> so<00:05:40.110> second<00:05:41.780> let's

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
controller to our class so second let's

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.320 
controller to our class so second let's
run<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.080> app<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.230> see<00:05:43.980> how<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.340> works<00:05:44.700> so

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
run the app and see how that works so

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.020 
run the app and see how that works so
here<00:05:45.570> we<00:05:45.660> have<00:05:45.980> so<00:05:46.980> just<00:05:47.190> move<00:05:47.340> this<00:05:47.550> over<00:05:47.730> so

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
here we have so just move this over so

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.920 
here we have so just move this over so
you<00:05:48.090> can<00:05:48.240> see<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:49.350> console<00:05:50.340> when<00:05:51.150> we<00:05:51.270> slide<00:05:51.720> on

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
you can see the console when we slide on

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.190 
you can see the console when we slide on
over<00:05:52.610> did<00:05:53.610> activate<00:05:54.300> which<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:55.050> course

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
over did activate which is of course

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.080 
over did activate which is of course
from<00:05:55.410> our<00:05:55.530> second<00:05:55.950> view<00:05:56.310> interface

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
from our second view interface

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.750 
from our second view interface
controller<00:05:57.840> side<00:05:58.410> back<00:05:58.590> over<00:05:58.889> so<00:05:59.490> there's<00:05:59.700> a

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
controller side back over so there's a

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.480 
controller side back over so there's a
lot<00:06:00.000> more<00:06:00.150> things<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.570> can<00:06:00.720> do<00:06:00.930> with<00:06:01.560> logic<00:06:01.830> in

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
lot more things you can do with logic in

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.700 
lot more things you can do with logic in
watchkit<00:06:03.390> apps<00:06:03.690> and<00:06:04.140> I'm<00:06:04.320> gonna<00:06:04.440> be<00:06:04.560> talking

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.770 
watchkit apps and I'm gonna be talking
them<00:06:04.980> about<00:06:05.340> them<00:06:05.610> later<00:06:06.180> in<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.390> series<00:06:06.570> and
