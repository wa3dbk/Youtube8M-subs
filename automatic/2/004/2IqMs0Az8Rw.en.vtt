in<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.000> game<00:00:21.060> he's<00:00:21.869> probably<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.320> least

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
in this game he's probably my least

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.179 
in this game he's probably my least
effective<00:00:23.519> character<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.269> play<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.650> he<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.710> I

effective character to play as he is I
don't<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.810> point<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.949> using<00:00:29.400> them

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
don't really see the point of using them

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.999 
don't really see the point of using them
right<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:29.990> what<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.140> offer<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.830> his

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
right now with what they offer for his

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160 
right now with what they offer for his
abilities<00:00:32.520> he's<00:00:32.880> good<00:00:33.270> from<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> distance<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
abilities he's good from a distance I

I got an orbital beacon in my pocket so
I'm<00:02:00.090> waiting<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
machine guns and they're pretty good as

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.530 
machine guns and they're pretty good as
a<00:02:04.770> hunter

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.030 

you<00:02:08.540> can<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> lot<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.020> damage<00:02:09.410> on<00:02:09.590> them<00:02:09.740> you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
you can get a lot of damage on them you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.290 
you can get a lot of damage on them you
can<00:02:10.160> see<00:02:10.400> I<00:02:10.430> picked<00:02:10.640> up<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.850> kill<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.120> there

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
can see I picked up the kill on there

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.320 
can see I picked up the kill on there
but<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.600> believe<00:02:11.980> Joey<00:02:12.980> had<00:02:13.250> most<00:02:13.760> damage<00:02:14.180> on

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
but I believe Joey had most damage on

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.260 
but I believe Joey had most damage on
that<00:02:14.480> guy<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.960> he<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> at<00:02:15.560> sis<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:17.090> can

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
that guy so he got it at sis and you can

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210 
that guy so he got it at sis and you can
really<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> nuisance<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.770> other<00:02:18.920> teams

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
really be a nuisance in the other teams

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.880 
really be a nuisance in the other teams
side<00:02:19.940> by<00:02:20.210> going<00:02:20.240> over<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.080> picking<00:02:21.590> up<00:02:21.650> some

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
side by going over and picking up some

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
side by going over and picking up some
kills<00:02:22.160> he's<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.700> garbage<00:02:23.390> man<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> hunter

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
kills he's a good garbage man the hunter

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.930 
kills he's a good garbage man the hunter
because<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.440> can<00:02:24.590> get<00:02:24.710> there<00:02:24.860> quick<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.460> you

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
because you can get there quick and you

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.640 
because you can get there quick and you
can<00:02:26.090> finish<00:02:26.240> off<00:02:26.480> some<00:02:26.660> kills<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.110> plane<00:02:27.440> mode

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
can finish off some kills in plane mode

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.210 
can finish off some kills in plane mode
so<00:02:28.220> here<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.490> seeing<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.820> five<00:02:29.090> kill<00:02:29.360> streak

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so here you seeing in a five kill streak

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.650 
so here you seeing in a five kill streak
and<00:02:31.220> I'm<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.520> kind<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.700> cruising<00:02:32.120> along<00:02:34.660> but

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
and I'm just kind of cruising along but

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.480 
and I'm just kind of cruising along but
I<00:02:35.810> recommend<00:02:36.410> using<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.920> hunter<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> couple

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
I recommend using the hunter a couple

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.010 
I recommend using the hunter a couple
times<00:02:37.670> at<00:02:37.820> each<00:02:37.850> map<00:02:38.240> just<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.660> kind<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.870> learn

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
times at each map just to kind of learn

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.080 
times at each map just to kind of learn
the<00:02:39.200> map<00:02:39.440> from<00:02:39.740> above<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.670> kind<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> gives

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
the map from above and it kind of gives

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.350 
the map from above and it kind of gives
you<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.210> better<00:02:41.420> feel<00:02:42.290> for<00:02:42.460> where<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:44.000> battles

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
you a better feel for where the battles

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.210 
you a better feel for where the battles
take<00:02:44.630> place<00:02:44.660> or<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> majority<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.890> battle

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
take place or the majority of the battle

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.100 
take place or the majority of the battle
so<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.460> kind<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.760> know<00:02:46.910> when<00:02:47.120> you're<00:02:47.360> being<00:02:47.960> a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so you kind of know when you're being a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.390 
so you kind of know when you're being a
different<00:02:48.380> character<00:02:48.710> as<00:02:48.830> well<00:02:49.070> and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
different character as well and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640 
different character as well and
Starscream<00:02:50.360> he's<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.840> pretty<00:02:51.200> cool<00:02:51.290> looking

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
Starscream he's a pretty cool looking

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.650 
Starscream he's a pretty cool looking
just<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.250> think<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.790> might<00:02:52.940> have<00:02:53.030> customized<00:02:53.450> his

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
just I think I might have customized his

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.090 
just I think I might have customized his
colors<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:54.110> little<00:02:54.350> bit<00:02:54.470> here<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.710> think<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:54.950> got<00:02:55.070> a

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
colors a little bit here I think I got a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.120 
colors a little bit here I think I got a
really<00:02:55.460> dark<00:02:55.730> grey<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.600> dark<00:02:56.870> black<00:02:57.740> I

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
really dark grey and a dark black I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.830 
really dark grey and a dark black I
guess<00:02:58.520> black<00:02:58.820> doesn't<00:02:59.240> get<00:02:59.390> any<00:02:59.540> darker<00:02:59.660> than

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
guess black doesn't get any darker than

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.820 
guess black doesn't get any darker than
black<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> got<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> black<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.400> gray<00:03:01.580> on<00:03:01.760> and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
black so I got a black and a gray on and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.980 
black so I got a black and a gray on and
what<00:03:03.830> I'm<00:03:03.950> using<00:03:03.980> for<00:03:04.280> him<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.540> spawn

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
what I'm using for him is the spawn

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.680 
what I'm using for him is the spawn
century<00:03:06.530> for<00:03:06.800> his<00:03:07.040> abilities<00:03:07.880> his<00:03:08.450> primary

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
century for his abilities his primary

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.750 
century for his abilities his primary
abilities<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.350> rocket<00:03:09.650> hover<00:03:09.830> hover<00:03:10.400> where

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
abilities of rocket hover hover where

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.140 
abilities of rocket hover hover where
you<00:03:10.820> shoot<00:03:10.970> rockets<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.280> his<00:03:13.280> primary<00:03:13.730> gun<00:03:14.000> is

you shoot rockets and his primary gun is
a<00:03:14.180> rocket<00:03:14.570> launcher<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.530> he's<00:03:15.709> focused<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
a rocket launcher so he's focused on a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.460 
a rocket launcher so he's focused on a
lot<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.610> rockets<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.989> won't<00:03:18.170> see<00:03:18.350> me

using rockets too much in this game as
you<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.360> I've<00:03:20.450> been<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.690> plain<00:03:21.160> form<00:03:22.160> for

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
you see I've been in plain form for

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.060 
you see I've been in plain form for
quite<00:03:22.940> some<00:03:23.150> time<00:03:23.180> here<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.800> I'm<00:03:24.890> really

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
quite some time here and I'm really

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.530 
quite some time here and I'm really
trying<00:03:25.250> out<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.580> still<00:03:25.760> force<00:03:26.060> somewhat<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.330> lot

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
trying out to still force somewhat a lot

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.240 
trying out to still force somewhat a lot
with<00:03:26.690> some<00:03:26.780> Jets<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.200> feel<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:28.040> still

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
with some Jets I feel like it still

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.190 
with some Jets I feel like it still
forced<00:03:28.610> benefits<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.540> them<00:03:29.660> more<00:03:29.959> than<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
forced benefits of them more than it

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.920 
forced benefits of them more than it
benefits<00:03:30.590> everybody<00:03:31.070> else<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.300> I'm<00:03:32.780> also

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
benefits everybody else and I'm also

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.949 
benefits everybody else and I'm also
using<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.680> scope<00:03:34.459> burst<00:03:34.760> rifle<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.900> a

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
using a scope burst rifle for a

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.570 
using a scope burst rifle for a
secondary<00:03:36.500> gun<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:37.100> want<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.550> a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
secondary gun I want to have a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.780 
secondary gun I want to have a
long-range<00:03:38.060> weapon<00:03:38.480> with<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.110> hunter<00:03:39.380> and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
long-range weapon with the hunter and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.550 
long-range weapon with the hunter and
I'm<00:03:40.790> using<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.450> believe<00:03:41.480> black<00:03:41.959> armor<00:03:42.380> because

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
I'm using I believe black armor because

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.650 
I'm using I believe black armor because
I<00:03:42.800> don't<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.430> trust<00:03:43.670> how<00:03:44.120> much<00:03:44.300> damage

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
I don't really trust how much damage

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.330 
I don't really trust how much damage
they<00:03:44.810> can<00:03:44.959> take<00:03:45.140> they're<00:03:45.440> not<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.070> strongest

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
they can take they're not the strongest

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.660 
they can take they're not the strongest
so<00:03:47.180> use<00:03:47.330> black<00:03:47.600> armor<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.250> almost<00:03:49.250> died<00:03:49.430> here

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
so use black armor and almost died here

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.860 
so use black armor and almost died here
and<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:49.940> got<00:03:50.120> out<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.270> there<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.480> don't<00:03:50.660> even<00:03:50.810> know

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
and I got out of there I don't even know

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.570 
and I got out of there I don't even know
I<00:03:50.930> think<00:03:51.020> my<00:03:51.260> sentry<00:03:51.650> pick<00:03:51.830> up<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.100> kill<00:03:52.310> and

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
I think my sentry pick up the kill and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.030 
I think my sentry pick up the kill and
then<00:03:53.510> puts<00:03:53.780> me<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.020> seven<00:03:54.350> kill<00:03:54.530> streak<00:03:54.800> so

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
then puts me on a seven kill streak so

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.490 
then puts me on a seven kill streak so
uh<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.450> believe<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.720> guy<00:03:57.020> just<00:03:57.080> left<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
uh and I believe that guy just left the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.930 
uh and I believe that guy just left the
game<00:03:57.650> because<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.100> but<00:03:58.400> oh<00:03:58.430> well

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
game because of that but oh well

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.360 
game because of that but oh well
I<00:03:58.970> think<00:03:59.690> we<00:03:59.780> got<00:03:59.930> some<00:04:00.080> more<00:04:00.230> coming<00:04:00.470> in<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.920> I

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
I think we got some more coming in and I

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.910 
I think we got some more coming in and I
might<00:04:02.000> be<00:04:02.030> using<00:04:02.270> martyrdom<00:04:02.959> or<00:04:03.230> sharpshooter

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
might be using martyrdom or sharpshooter

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.350 
might be using martyrdom or sharpshooter
on<00:04:04.010> him<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.220> was<00:04:04.459> thinking<00:04:04.489> maybe<00:04:04.970> was<00:04:05.180> just

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
trying out martyred on what structure is

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.800 
trying out martyred on what structure is
a<00:04:07.010> good<00:04:07.190> thing<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.459> have<00:04:07.580> on
