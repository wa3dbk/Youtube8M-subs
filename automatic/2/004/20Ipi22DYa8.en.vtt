the chest badge if I can I'm gonna start

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.820 
the chest badge if I can I'm gonna start
off<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.279> our<00:00:17.369> Omnitrix<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> first

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
off with our Omnitrix this is the first

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.950 
off with our Omnitrix this is the first
Omnitrix<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.880> ever<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> Ben<00:00:21.539> 10<00:00:21.750> toy

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
Omnitrix that was ever in the Ben 10 toy

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
Omnitrix that was ever in the Ben 10 toy
series<00:00:22.760> it's<00:00:23.760> still<00:00:24.000> twisted<00:00:25.400> like<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:27.269> we're

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
series it's still twisted like if we're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.880 
series it's still twisted like if we're
calibrated<00:00:28.199> into<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:31.590> button

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
calibrated into this and this button

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:40.119 
calibrated into this and this button
right<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:36.440> keep<00:00:37.440> pushing<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.960> then

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
right here keep pushing that and then

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.660 
right here keep pushing that and then
don't<00:00:41.129> answer<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.790> light<00:00:41.969> effects<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
don't answer the light effects so you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.889 
don't answer the light effects so you
basically<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.000> take<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.329> apart<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
basically you can take this apart and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.750 
basically you can take this apart and
make<00:00:49.170> them<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.440> different<00:00:49.829> combinations<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
make them into different combinations I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
make them into different combinations I
done<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.719> three<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> example<00:00:52.710> Pinterest

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
done all three in the example Pinterest

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.510 
done all three in the example Pinterest
it's<00:00:53.489> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> tough<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> figure<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:55.520> but

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it's kind of tough to figure it out but

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:10.030 
it's kind of tough to figure it out but
all<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.059> omnitrix's<00:01:05.720> they<00:01:06.720> pop<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
all the omnitrix's they pop up like that

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.000 
all the omnitrix's they pop up like that
still<00:01:11.040> turn<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:12.020> activate<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> light<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
still turn it activate the light and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.270 
still turn it activate the light and
then<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> could<00:01:15.180> lets<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:19.280> here

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
then you could lets back down now here

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.899 
then you could lets back down now here
is<00:01:20.759> earn<00:01:21.000> nearly<00:01:21.930> latest<00:01:22.790> Omnitrix

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
is earn nearly latest Omnitrix

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.060 
is earn nearly latest Omnitrix
the<00:01:24.180> Ultimatrix<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.430> dial<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.030> more<00:01:30.390> accurate

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the Ultimatrix the dial is more accurate

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:42.860 
the Ultimatrix the dial is more accurate
than<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> alien<00:01:32.729> force<00:01:33.150> version

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.920 

the<00:01:43.870> reason<00:01:44.230> why<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.710> because<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:46.000> these<00:01:46.690> do

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
the reason why is because that these do

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.260 
the reason why is because that these do
not<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.290> these<00:01:48.100> from<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.490> old<00:01:48.700> ultimate

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
not have these from the old ultimate

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.870 
not have these from the old ultimate
Omnitrix<00:01:49.810> but<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:51.040> one<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.370> very<00:01:51.400> accurate

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
Omnitrix but this one is very accurate

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.960 
Omnitrix but this one is very accurate
to<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.300> show<00:01:56.610> even<00:01:57.610> though<00:01:57.730> with<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
to the show even though with the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.060 
to the show even though with the
inaccuracy<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.900> still<00:01:59.260> think<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.710> kind<00:01:59.980> of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
inaccuracy I still think this is kind of

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.780 
inaccuracy I still think this is kind of
cool<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:04.240> wish<00:02:04.660> that<00:02:04.690> Bandai<00:02:05.229> America<00:02:05.790> have

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
cool and I wish that Bandai America have

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.450 
cool and I wish that Bandai America have
made<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.180> omniverse<00:02:07.810> Omnitrix<00:02:08.500> parts<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.310> add
