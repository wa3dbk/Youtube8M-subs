00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello my name is Laura and I will explain 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.730
 how mushroom cheese works in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.309
 first of all tell you that you have to put it 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.370
 in an area in the coolest area of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.150
 our house as a kitchen in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.320
 covered laundry rooms or basements with light and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 windows where we have ventilation not 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 never expose it to the sun directly on 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.990
 Second, do not do anything to the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.890
 mushrooms cheese when we buy it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.070
 neither remove the flap lid nor remove 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 plastic or make holes in it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.340
 container is ready so that by the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.850
 top hole start to come out 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 mushrooms in third place is very important 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.250
 self ventilation ventilation 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.470
 a house is enough you can not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.020
 expose 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.650
 to a current of air since the 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.980
 fungus would suffer and would not go well in 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.530
 fourth place the ideal temperature for 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.520
 that the mushroom leaves oscillates between 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.450
 14 and 19 degrees Celsius 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 to 2022 they could also come out but better 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.510
 between 14 to 19 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.570
 fifth will be applied with a 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.120
 water sprayer when we see that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 begin to come out the first primordia 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.760
 meanwhile nothing is not watered the cheese 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.660
 of the mushroom neither in the tap nor with 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.580
 sprayer only when they start 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.950
 get out the first primordia that are 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.670
 some little white bumps through the little hole 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.800
 from above and moving the lid 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.180
 we started to spray at 30 centimeters 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.130
 with tap water nothing else one two three 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.820
 four times a day 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.200
 if your place when the zeta have the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.560
 almost flat edge 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 and a little reset reseca is good not 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.299
 we get to have the dry but when 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.269
 the edge we see it flat are ready 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.390
 to collect how the 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.660
 mushroom cheese very easy messes 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.140
 hands underneath are not cut off 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.019
 they start as if giving a half turn and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.349
 pulling up once we have 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:29.810
 collected the mushroom we cleaned well the 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:32.690
 little hole in the remaining trunk 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.770
 to make way for the next harvest 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.620
 when the recommended days pass 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:45.000
 in seventh place once he has given us 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.340
 the first harvest to consume 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.520
 all you have to do is clean the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.240
 hole, you do not have to throw water, there's no 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.430
 to remove a lid nothing simply what 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.340
 we leave in the same place where 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.400
 We had and we waited between 20 and 30 days 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.980
 that the second thing will come out of two to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.860
 three crops as for the consumption of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.480
 a family and a tasting of 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.470
 delicatessen because it is a product 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.330
 fresh natural and freshly cut the only thing 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.239
 ask them to have a little bit of 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.350
 patience and I hope you like our 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.350
 invention and nothing else thank you 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.790
 when
