 directed by milano da milano moda 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:11.740
 woman and today we probably have it 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.170
 one of the most famous Italian fashion designer 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.299
 most authoritative voices of our system 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.519

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.279

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.130
 immediately the word because time is a lot 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.579
 soon there will be another 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.100
 fashion show to our user 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.410
 salesman wants to ask a question later 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.530
 having seen in streaming and having sent 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.010
 via google plus the show to you the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.630
 word hi giorgio hi simone his 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.360
 fashion shows mark a fundamental date 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.490
 for Milan fashion week e 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.980
 the collection we have seen is 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.050
 characterized by calm tones and themes 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 representing a kind of detail 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.040
 romance 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.590
 here I would like to know what I got from 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.970
 where he had drawn inspiration for the 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.970
 new spring summer collection 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.330
 we don't know that every designer at his 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.930
 moment of darkness in the sense that when 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.150
 start thinking about the collection must 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.450
 hold on to something and it's a moment 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.120
 of darkness that is where I hold this 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.190
 once we say it was a choice 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.370
 let's say more tied to a fact of color 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.360
 rather than made an extravagance 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.000
 choice of colors that recalled a little 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.630
 the age of the Marrakesh Garden 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.180
 anemones the spices the stronger ones for 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 more decided what than normally in 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.360
 my collections is not so obvious 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.869
 therefore wings from there was born the whole 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.880
 collection that was mainly used for 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.860
 variations on the theme whether it is 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.350
 connection with the si of the collection 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.630
 linked to the day rather than linked 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.570
 in the evening 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.820
 here is the next question we want to do 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 anticipating a great event that will take place 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.860
 on October 24th in New York brought the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.060
 fashion 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.410
 Italian in Rome this summer by doing a 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.420
 beautiful party at the eur and conquering 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.490
 the country again in a very moment 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.990
 difficult for this country 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.780
 now new york how to become the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.240
 fashion interpreters bring it 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.180
 abroad to bring it to Italy and feel 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.410
 to be a bit like saying the engines of the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.470
 things that work but the important thing is not 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.000
 he believes he has this weight in the world 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.880
 in this trade a good deal of 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.940
 modesty it takes well first read one 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.370
 sentence beginning of our talk more 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.160
 known in Italy I could have 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.260
 jump on the table saying that it is not there 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.660
 only Italy where I am known 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.160
 I go to China the little Chinese girl mi 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.170
 stops in the street 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.380
 okay in spain on the beach of the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.890
 d'ibiza holbrooke the group of people 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.250
 who stop me I am known a little bit 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.140
 international way his question was 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.269
 how do you feel having this weight in 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.209
 reality not taken weight as far as 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.580
 regards bringing the Italian flag into 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.209
 around the world 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.200
 referring to fashion, he is very busy 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:37.430
 because you can make do with a choice 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.500
 collection of a specialized press e 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.290
 therefore displease an audience 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.769
 of fashion is something double edged 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.350
 often waxes if they contain a sector 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.739
 up and there's a nose it's hard to find 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.200
 the formula that works for everyone 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.330
 the big secret is to get closer to this 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.190
 formula 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.480
