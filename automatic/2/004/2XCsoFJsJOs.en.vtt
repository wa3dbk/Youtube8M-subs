the line of scrimmage why is this

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
the line of scrimmage why is this
important<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> watch<00:00:44.850> you're<00:00:45.420> seeing<00:00:45.629> the

important to watch you're seeing the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
important to watch you're seeing the
option<00:00:46.230> game<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.770> basically<00:00:47.010> eight<00:00:47.760> thomas

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
option game they basically eight thomas

option game they basically eight thomas
to<00:00:48.600> go<00:00:48.719> outside<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.379> keep<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> himself<00:00:49.829> he's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to go outside to keep it himself he's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
to go outside to keep it himself he's
not<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.640> fast<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.090> Jeremiah<00:00:51.449> Masoli<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.199> Cal

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
not as fast as Jeremiah Masoli and Cal

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
not as fast as Jeremiah Masoli and Cal
knows<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> keep<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> safety<00:00:54.360> off

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
knows this so you keep the safety off

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
knows this so you keep the safety off
the<00:00:54.690> line<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> scrimmage<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.500> let<00:00:55.890> him<00:00:56.039> attack

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the line of scrimmage and let him attack

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430 
the line of scrimmage and let him attack
so<00:00:56.910> he<00:00:57.030> doesn't<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.329> caught<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
so he doesn't get caught up in all the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.920 
so he doesn't get caught up in all the
traffic<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:59.129> laterally<00:00:59.910> left<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> right<00:01:00.510> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
traffic going laterally left to right it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.439 
traffic going laterally left to right it
was<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> great<00:01:01.410> plan<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.010> conti<00:01:02.579> Chris<00:01:03.239> Compton

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
was a great plan and conti Chris Compton

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
was a great plan and conti Chris Compton

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
of safety really executed it well the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.429 
of safety really executed it well the
other<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.360> linebackers<00:01:07.049> inside

weaknesses<00:01:50.120> I<00:01:50.330> think<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:51.440> talked<00:01:51.680> about

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
weaknesses I think that we talked about

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.070 
weaknesses I think that we talked about
it<00:01:51.980> with<00:01:52.040> Thomas<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.760> quarterback<00:01:53.270> not<00:01:53.690> as<00:01:53.840> fast

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
it with Thomas a quarterback not as fast

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.830 
it with Thomas a quarterback not as fast
as<00:01:54.350> Jeremiah<00:01:55.250> Masoli<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.730> year<00:01:55.940> ago<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.480> can

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
as Jeremiah Masoli a year ago so you can

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.960 
as Jeremiah Masoli a year ago so you can
slow<00:01:57.170> him<00:01:57.200> down<00:01:57.350> on<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.740> outside<00:01:57.830> run<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
slow him down on the outside run and the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.640 
slow him down on the outside run and the
wide<00:01:59.150> receivers<00:01:59.630> aren't<00:01:59.810> great<00:02:00.080> for<00:02:00.110> or<00:02:00.380> get

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
wide receivers aren't great for or get

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.530 
wide receivers aren't great for or get
in<00:02:00.740> terms<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.070> separating<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:01.880> you've<00:02:02.270> got<00:02:02.450> to
