00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.410 
the blade is still shot what we'll also
do<00:03:03.750> after<00:03:04.110> every<00:03:04.379> test<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:05.670> will<00:03:05.760> go<00:03:05.909> back<00:03:06.120> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
do after every test we will go back to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.320 
do after every test we will go back to
the<00:03:06.930> paper<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.140> demonstrate<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the paper and just demonstrate the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.050 
the paper and just demonstrate the
cutting<00:03:12.629> ability<00:03:12.959> at<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.110> edge<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.060> okay

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
cutting ability at the edge like so okay

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.970 
cutting ability at the edge like so okay
the<00:03:15.180> next<00:03:15.390> test<00:03:15.690> calls<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.349> us<00:03:16.409> to<00:03:16.560> batten

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the next test calls for us to batten

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.089 
the next test calls for us to batten
some<00:03:17.250> knotted<00:03:17.640> hardwood<00:03:18.680> what<00:03:19.680> I've<00:03:19.769> got<00:03:19.920> here

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
some knotted hardwood what I've got here

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.420 
some knotted hardwood what I've got here
I've<00:03:20.250> got<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.640> few<00:03:20.879> pieces<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.860> well<00:03:22.860> seasoned

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
I've got a few pieces of well seasoned

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.319 
I've got a few pieces of well seasoned
oak<00:03:24.230> cut<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.319> me<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:25.709> hard<00:03:26.239> some<00:03:27.239> of

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
oak cut with me it's pretty hard some of

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.500 
oak cut with me it's pretty hard some of
it<00:03:27.420> has<00:03:27.569> not<00:03:27.840> some<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.379> hasn't<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.239> also

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
it has not some of it hasn't but I also

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.490 
it has not some of it hasn't but I also
have<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> piece<00:03:30.900> there

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
have a piece there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.610 
have a piece there
that's<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.579> crook<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.849> a<00:03:32.909> V<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:34.319> another

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that's a crook of a V in it and another

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.270 
that's a crook of a V in it and another
piece<00:03:34.829> there<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:40.280> that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
piece there and just so you can see that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.550 
piece there and just so you can see that
it<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.430> right<00:03:41.730> there's<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.540> end<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> log<00:03:43.349> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
it is right there's the end of the log a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.640 
it is right there's the end of the log a
little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:43.859> rock<00:03:44.069> there<00:03:45.079> but<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.200> rest<00:03:46.379> of<00:03:46.500> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
little bit rock there but the rest of it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.449 
little bit rock there but the rest of it
is<00:03:47.310> very<00:03:47.459> very<00:03:47.940> hard<00:03:48.209> as<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.450> steel<00:03:49.190> it's<00:03:50.190> going

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
is very very hard as I steel it's going

00:03:50.459 --> 00:04:12.420 
is very very hard as I steel it's going
to<00:03:50.519> try<00:03:51.000> it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.469 

I<00:04:15.389> went<00:04:16.389> through<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.660> bit<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:19.299> bring<00:04:19.449> that

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
I went through that bit just bring that

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.020 
I went through that bit just bring that
bit<00:04:19.720> up<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.930> camera<00:04:20.459> see<00:04:21.459> what<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.669> inside<00:04:22.000> is

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
bit up to camera see what the inside is

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.450 
bit up to camera see what the inside is
like<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:26.110> pretty<00:04:26.440> hard<00:04:26.650> cut<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
like so that is pretty hard cut the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.010 
like so that is pretty hard cut the
knots<00:04:27.669> in<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.910> but<00:04:28.360> you've<00:04:28.479> also<00:04:28.600> got<00:04:28.900> this

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
knots in it but you've also got this

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:52.120 
knots in it but you've also got this
twist<00:04:29.259> in<00:04:29.440> grain<00:04:31.020> let's<00:04:32.020> keep<00:04:32.139> going

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.400 

let's<00:04:52.790> get<00:04:52.880> this<00:04:53.000> vp<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.540> try<00:04:54.520> see<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.580> there

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
let's get this vp to try see it there

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.630 
let's get this vp to try see it there
the<00:04:57.410> best<00:04:57.680> way<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.860> back<00:04:58.070> of<00:04:58.190> this<00:04:58.310> one<00:04:58.370> let's

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
the best way the back of this one let's

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:22.660 
the best way the back of this one let's
try<00:04:58.760> right<00:04:59.030> there

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.310 

that's<00:05:23.670> at<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:24.000> moment<00:05:24.030> might<00:05:24.930> have<00:05:25.050> defeated

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
that's at the moment might have defeated

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:46.829 
that's at the moment might have defeated
it

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:46.839 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.260 

it<00:05:47.839> doesn't<00:05:48.229> like<00:05:48.349> that<00:05:48.819> b-minor<00:05:49.819> that's<00:05:50.059> so

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
it doesn't like that b-minor that's so

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.760 
it doesn't like that b-minor that's so
horribly<00:05:50.689> twisted<00:05:51.139> in<00:05:51.229> there<00:05:51.409> it's<00:05:51.529> hardly

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
horribly twisted in there it's hardly

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.799 
horribly twisted in there it's hardly
surprising<00:05:52.159> put<00:05:53.119> that<00:05:53.240> one<00:05:53.389> down<00:05:53.419> for<00:05:53.779> a

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:53.809 
surprising put that one down for a

00:05:53.809 --> 00:06:24.060 
surprising put that one down for a
moment<00:05:54.939> go<00:05:55.939> back<00:05:56.059> to<00:05:56.149> a<00:05:56.179> regular<00:05:56.469> piece<00:05:57.469> of<00:05:57.589> oak

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.640 

but<00:06:24.610> that<00:06:24.760> has<00:06:24.940> a<00:06:24.970> real<00:06:25.390> nasty<00:06:25.780> knot<00:06:26.230> in<00:06:26.380> it<00:06:26.470> but

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
but that has a real nasty knot in it but

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.280 
but that has a real nasty knot in it but
it<00:06:26.770> seems<00:06:26.980> to<00:06:27.130> cope<00:06:27.520> with<00:06:27.670> it<00:06:27.790> quite<00:06:27.940> well<00:06:31.290> try

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
it seems to cope with it quite well try

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:44.159 
it seems to cope with it quite well try
that<00:06:32.440> one<00:06:32.560> again

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:55.170 

yes<00:06:45.009> done<00:06:45.219> that<00:06:45.340> one<00:06:45.490> quite<00:06:45.699> nicely

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.920 

I'll<00:06:55.870> bring<00:06:56.050> this<00:06:56.170> up<00:06:56.350> for<00:06:56.710> piece<00:06:57.190> of<00:06:57.310> paper

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
I'll bring this up for piece of paper

I'll bring this up for piece of paper
I'm<00:06:58.930> not<00:06:59.080> gonna<00:06:59.230> edit<00:06:59.320> this

there's the plate of fattening for I can

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.869 
there's the plate of fattening for I can
