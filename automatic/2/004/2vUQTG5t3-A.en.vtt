00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
little novo s10 - - now the s10 was part

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.690 
little novo s10 - - now the s10 was part
one<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> most<00:00:13.559> popular<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.280> epics<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:14.610> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
one of the most popular in epics when it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.220 
one of the most popular in epics when it
first<00:00:14.820> came<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.089> right<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.719> middle<00:00:15.809> when

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
first came out right in the middle when

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.480 
first came out right in the middle when
everything<00:00:16.680> first<00:00:16.830> started<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.220> netbooks

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
everything first started with netbooks

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.090 
everything first started with netbooks
but<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.690> redesign<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.619> still

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
but this is the redesign now it's still

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
but this is the redesign now it's still
the<00:00:20.400> same<00:00:20.670> setup<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.300> didn't<00:00:21.510> want<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the same setup they didn't want to you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.660 
the same setup they didn't want to you
know<00:00:22.350> evolution<00:00:23.039> eyes<00:00:23.130> they<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.460> wanted<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
know evolution eyes they just wanted to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.040 
know evolution eyes they just wanted to
make<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> new<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.359> they<00:00:24.810> don't<00:00:24.960> have

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
make a new one because they don't have

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.179 
make a new one because they don't have
the<00:00:25.170> same<00:00:25.289> model<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.650> too<00:00:25.769> long<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.099> they

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the same model for too long so they

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.769 
the same model for too long so they
changed<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.880> things<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.660> there

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
changed little things here and there

changed little things here and there
very<00:00:27.810> very<00:00:28.230> small<00:00:28.500> things<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
just change the layout they kind of

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.420 
just change the layout they kind of
learn<00:00:30.929> from<00:00:31.199> their<00:00:31.380> mistakes<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.890> basically

it<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> same<00:00:33.660> netbook<00:00:34.440> same<00:00:34.980> price<00:00:35.250> Prices

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it is the same netbook same price Prices

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
it is the same netbook same price Prices
did<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.270> very<00:00:36.690> affordable<00:00:37.140> very

power they also upgraded the processor a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
power they also upgraded the processor a
little<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> atom<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.610> 270<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bit more performance especially when

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
bit more performance especially when
