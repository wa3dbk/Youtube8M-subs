00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello to all and master 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.280
 windows we find ourselves for a new 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 video how to boost his pc very 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.580
 easily very easy techniques 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.349
 that I am going to teach you today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 finally a technique that works 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 excellently well we will go on a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 website it's zero net point 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.289
 I put you the link in the description 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 of course to download game 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.210
 boost then you hear it game 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 boost her for games but it works 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 obviously also for the performances 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.750
 basic pc we will watch a small 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.180
 little does it give when we run 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 game booster we fall on it we do 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 booster on click 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.440
 there is no clearer we are waiting for his 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.570
 abrupt and sees the performance before 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 bousseta on to the gray bar that judges 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.899
 that performance after boost improve 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 2 40% 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.760
 one at the bar until it actually there 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.610
 software removes all processes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.239
 unnecessary to your work on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.829
 computer 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.949
 that is, everything that does not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.750
 is absolutely useless but who are 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.430
 launched by the base computer when 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.049
 Canton light it well it will 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.390
 delete all those files that does not serve 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.950
 absolutely nothing I guarantee you and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 even when you restart your pc or 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.189
 when you have that restore restored 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 the files in case you are scared 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.350
 but that's absolutely nothing 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.869
 fairly well known software so we can see 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.850
 the useless services that stopped him by 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.470
 example here we have 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.530
 we have lots of things that do not serve 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.090
 absolutely nothing else we have here too 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.330
 so he fragments a little bit the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.240
 ram memory it star presses the paper 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.799
 power device and it turns off 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 automatic updates because 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.950
 that also takes a little bit always 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.920
 here we can diagnose or whatever 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.320
 it is really a very very very 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.180
 very good software 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.429
 this is version 3.4 so here 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.069
 excellent software that allows you to 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.600
 to really do a lot of stuff like 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.100
 boost your pc obviously and the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.550
 boost during the games since you 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.580
 also have you also have the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.470
 possibility to defragment and also 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.510
 switch in the game box so you 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.720
 have all your games that are registered here 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.000
 and you can click on a game it was 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.400
 booster and get started click and it's okay 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 booster specifically for this game and the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.500
 launch at the same time so that allows you 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.630
 to have extraordinary performances 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.610
 for your game we also below 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.780
 the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.660
 information from different 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.400
 components the CPU so the processor on 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.970
 sees that it is about 44 degrees 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.060
 the 35 Â° motherboard the graphics card to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.680
 32 the hard drive at 30k speed phone 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.500
 so has the ram to 1700 see here 2000 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.030
 rides up there it's really nice 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.300
 can see a lot of things we can 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.340
 configure obviously each pro 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.530
 process all we really want 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.960
 it's absolutely incredible 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.020
 Aurier useless to play the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.650
 Percentage Strike means to play 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.459
 good it depends if we make videos 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.269
 really see it's really excellent 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.340
 Thank you for following me
