00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the book you can tell that that doesn't

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.020 
the book you can tell that that doesn't
quite<00:01:15.540> work<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.770> television<00:01:17.340> shows<00:01:17.580> favor

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
quite work in the television shows favor

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.539 
quite work in the television shows favor
because<00:01:18.720> he<00:01:19.110> doesn't<00:01:19.920> act<00:01:20.070> Christian<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.490> all

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
because he doesn't act Christian at all

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.490 
because he doesn't act Christian at all
that's<00:01:20.820> why<00:01:20.970> he's<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.390> punk<00:01:21.990> rock<00:01:22.259> and

that's why he's more punk rock and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700 
that's why he's more punk rock and
that's<00:01:22.619> clearly<00:01:23.369> why<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.409> comic<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> called

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that's clearly why the comic is called

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.980 
that's clearly why the comic is called
punk<00:01:25.950> rock<00:01:26.130> Jesus<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.000> oh<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.810> god

I<00:01:53.430> had<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.450> black<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I had with it was that it's black and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
I had with it was that it's black and
white<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.950> always<00:01:56.549> seem<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> forget

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
white which I always seem to forget

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
white which I always seem to forget
every<00:01:57.420> time<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> open<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> comic<00:01:58.469> whoa<00:01:59.009> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
every time I open the comic whoa so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.280 
every time I open the comic whoa so
while<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> really<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> sketchiness<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
while I really like the sketchiness of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
while I really like the sketchiness of
it<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.219> adds<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> tone<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it I think it really adds to the tone of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
it I think it really adds to the tone of
the<00:02:03.689> whole<00:02:03.719> series<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:04.860> have

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the whole series I really would have

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.510 
the whole series I really would have
liked<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.119> color<00:02:06.540> because

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
liked to see more of it in color because

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.279 
liked to see more of it in color because
Chris<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.759> main<00:02:08.940> character<00:02:09.450> Chris<00:02:09.989> like

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289

Chris just seems like a very vibrant
person<00:02:13.790> especially<00:02:14.240> when<00:02:14.450> he<00:02:14.630> grows<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:14.930> and

really liked to seen more of that with

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.550 
really liked to seen more of that with
the<00:02:25.520> exception<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.480> cover<00:02:26.690> pages<00:02:26.960> this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the exception of the cover pages this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.310 
the exception of the cover pages this
series<00:02:27.950> has<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:29.420> really<00:02:29.930> unique

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
series has a really really unique

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.650 
series has a really really unique
premise<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.640> which<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.180> think<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.480> one<00:02:32.630> of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
premise to it which I think is one of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.320 
premise to it which I think is one of
the<00:02:32.750> reasons<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.140> liked<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.730> will<00:02:35.150> warn

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
the reasons I liked it and I will warn

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330 
the reasons I liked it and I will warn
you<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:35.930> for<00:02:36.590> people<00:02:37.100> who<00:02:37.220> are

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
you it's not for people who are

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.400 
you it's not for people who are
obviously<00:02:37.760> more<00:02:38.210> religious<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:38.990> at<00:02:39.230> least

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
obviously more religious or at least

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.830 
obviously more religious or at least
can't<00:02:39.680> handle<00:02:40.640> their<00:02:41.030> religion<00:02:41.630> being

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
can't handle their religion being

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200 
can't handle their religion being
questioned<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.830> example<00:02:43.610> there's<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.910> part

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
questioned for example there's a part

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.090 
questioned for example there's a part
where<00:02:44.270> Chris<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.110> Jesus<00:02:45.410> Christ<00:02:45.590> says

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
where Chris is like Jesus Christ says

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.180 
where Chris is like Jesus Christ says
 you<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:48.110> you're<00:02:48.350> offended<00:02:48.650> by<00:02:48.860> such

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
 you and if you're offended by such

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.890 
 you and if you're offended by such
things<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:49.670> should<00:02:49.850> definitely<00:02:50.330> not<00:02:50.510> pick<00:02:50.780> up

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
things you should definitely not pick up

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.440 
things you should definitely not pick up
this<00:02:51.020> comic<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.070> while<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.460> thought<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.240> series

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
this comic so while I thought the series

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.750 
this comic so while I thought the series
was<00:02:53.870> wonderfully<00:02:54.470> original<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.040> had<00:02:55.280> some

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
was wonderfully original and had some

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.180 
was wonderfully original and had some
great<00:02:56.000> storytelling<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.960> characters<00:02:57.440> there

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
great storytelling and characters there

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.770 
great storytelling and characters there
obviously<00:02:58.580> going<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.820> be<00:02:58.880> some<00:02:58.970> cons<00:02:59.330> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
obviously going to be some cons the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.630 
obviously going to be some cons the
first<00:03:00.050> problem<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.560> had<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.010> was<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
first problem I had with it was the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.050 
first problem I had with it was the
ending<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:03.020> don't<00:03:03.230> know<00:03:03.350> if<00:03:03.770> because<00:03:04.430> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
ending and I don't know if because the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.650 
ending and I don't know if because the
rest<00:03:05.240> of<00:03:05.360> series<00:03:05.690> was<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.380> good<00:03:06.680> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
rest of series was just so good and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.330 
rest of series was just so good and
maybe<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.990> ending<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.680> thought<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.160> my<00:03:10.310> mind

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
maybe the ending I thought in my mind

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.100 
maybe the ending I thought in my mind
was<00:03:10.640> gonna<00:03:10.760> be<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> lot<00:03:11.180> better<00:03:11.390> but<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.900> feel

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
was gonna be a lot better but I feel

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.380 
was gonna be a lot better but I feel
like<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.560> was<00:03:12.740> just<00:03:13.190> kind<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.580> disappointing

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
like it was just kind of disappointing

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.060 
like it was just kind of disappointing
and<00:03:14.570> fell<00:03:14.870> flat<00:03:15.110> compared<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.800> rest<00:03:15.950> of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and fell flat compared to the rest of

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.880 
and fell flat compared to the rest of
the<00:03:16.130> series<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.790> ending<00:03:17.090> almost<00:03:17.450> felt<00:03:17.720> like

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
the series the ending almost felt like

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.380 
the series the ending almost felt like
they<00:03:18.890> didn't<00:03:19.220> know<00:03:19.250> what<00:03:19.430> else<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:20.000> and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
they didn't know what else to do and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.930 
they didn't know what else to do and
since<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.560> was<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.680> last<00:03:21.770> issue<00:03:22.130> they<00:03:22.460> had<00:03:22.730> to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
since it was the last issue they had to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.430 
since it was the last issue they had to
end<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.600> they<00:03:23.720> were<00:03:23.780> just<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.080> alright

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
end it so they were just like alright

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.080 
end it so they were just like alright
this<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.800> ending<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.430> we're<00:03:25.880> just<00:03:25.940> gonna

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
this is the ending and we're just gonna

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.090 
this is the ending and we're just gonna
call<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.600> day<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.050> then<00:03:27.560> they<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:27.710> kind<00:03:28.040> of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
call it a day and then they do kind of

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.090 
call it a day and then they do kind of
like<00:03:28.250> an<00:03:28.370> epilogue<00:03:28.850> thing<00:03:29.750> for<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.770> second

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
like an epilogue thing for the second

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000 
like an epilogue thing for the second
half<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.850> issue<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.800> seemed

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
half of the issue and it just seemed

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.470 
half of the issue and it just seemed
really<00:03:34.280> thrown<00:03:35.270> together<00:03:35.600> really<00:03:36.290> rushed<00:03:36.740> and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
really thrown together really rushed and

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.170 
really thrown together really rushed and
not<00:03:38.480> very<00:03:38.930> satisfying<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.310> other<00:03:40.430> problem<00:03:40.910> I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
not very satisfying the other problem I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.760 
not very satisfying the other problem I
had<00:03:41.450> with<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.750> series<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.320> it<00:03:42.410> kind<00:03:42.590> of<00:03:42.620> goes

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
had with the series and it kind of goes

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.280 
had with the series and it kind of goes
into<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.850> being<00:03:44.270> kind<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.570> rushed<00:03:44.840> at<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> end

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
into it being kind of rushed at the end

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.460 
into it being kind of rushed at the end
was<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.430> felt<00:03:46.910> there<00:03:47.870> were<00:03:47.990> some<00:03:48.050> loose

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
was that I felt there were some loose

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.130 
was that I felt there were some loose
ends<00:03:48.740> that<00:03:49.010> weren't<00:03:49.730> tied<00:03:49.970> for<00:03:50.630> example<00:03:51.020> there

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
ends that weren't tied for example there

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.750 
ends that weren't tied for example there
were<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> couple<00:03:51.650> parts<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.130> series<00:03:52.520> where

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
were a couple parts in the series where

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.530 
were a couple parts in the series where
we<00:03:52.910> see<00:03:53.120> angels<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:55.120> nothing<00:03:56.120> was<00:03:56.270> ever

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
we see angels and nothing was ever

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.290 
we see angels and nothing was ever
really<00:03:57.020> said<00:03:57.500> or<00:03:57.650> explained<00:03:58.100> about<00:03:58.370> him<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.240> it

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
really said or explained about him so it

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.390 
really said or explained about him so it
was<00:03:59.480> like<00:03:59.630> did<00:03:59.870> that<00:03:59.900> actually<00:04:00.290> happen<00:04:00.620> are

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
was like did that actually happen are

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.550 
was like did that actually happen are
these<00:04:01.580> people<00:04:01.940> crazy

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
these people crazy

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.170 
these people crazy
what<00:04:03.980> was<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.280> point<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.580> bringing<00:04:04.730> them<00:04:05.000> in

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
what was the point of bringing them in

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.530 
what was the point of bringing them in
when<00:04:06.110> they<00:04:06.440> really<00:04:06.770> didn't<00:04:07.130> add<00:04:07.490> much<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
when they really didn't add much to the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.890 
when they really didn't add much to the
story<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.560> feel<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.310> also<00:04:10.670> feel<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.570> series

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
story I feel I also feel that the series

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.550 
story I feel I also feel that the series
could<00:04:12.140> have<00:04:12.260> been<00:04:12.410> longer<00:04:13.070> not<00:04:13.880> even<00:04:14.210> like<00:04:14.560> one

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
could have been longer not even like one

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.950 
could have been longer not even like one
or<00:04:15.800> two<00:04:15.860> issues<00:04:16.430> longer<00:04:16.880> but<00:04:17.210> I<00:04:17.480> feel<00:04:17.750> like<00:04:17.810> it

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:17.960 
or two issues longer but I feel like it

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.440 
or two issues longer but I feel like it
could<00:04:18.109> have<00:04:18.140> been<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.590> full-on<00:04:18.920> series

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
could have been a full-on series

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.500 
could have been a full-on series
I<00:04:20.479> think<00:04:21.020> the<00:04:21.799> care

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
I think the care

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.270 
I think the care
ders<00:04:22.720> could<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.440> been<00:04:23.560> flushed<00:04:23.800> out<00:04:23.980> a<00:04:24.040> bit

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
ders could have been flushed out a bit

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.580 
ders could have been flushed out a bit
more<00:04:24.490> especially<00:04:25.420> like<00:04:25.840> relationships

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
more especially like relationships

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.640 
more especially like relationships
between<00:04:26.740> Chris<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.460> his<00:04:27.850> mom<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.630> even<00:04:29.410> his

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
between Chris and his mom and even his

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.310 
between Chris and his mom and even his
mom<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.310> Thomas<00:04:30.850> who<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.060> her<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.050> Chris's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
mom and Thomas who is her and Chris's

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.140 
mom and Thomas who is her and Chris's
bodyguard<00:04:32.890> but<00:04:33.580> there<00:04:33.760> were<00:04:33.820> some<00:04:34.000> really

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
bodyguard but there were some really

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.660 
bodyguard but there were some really
good<00:04:34.450> relationships<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.500> felt<00:04:35.740> like<00:04:35.890> they

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
good relationships and I felt like they

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.690 
good relationships and I felt like they
were<00:04:36.730> just<00:04:37.060> kind<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.740> fell<00:04:38.740> flat<00:04:38.950> at<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.370> end

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
were just kind of fell flat at the end

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.880 
were just kind of fell flat at the end
just<00:04:40.360> keeps<00:04:40.600> going<00:04:40.840> back<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.290> end<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.680> was

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
just keeps going back to the end I was

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.260 
just keeps going back to the end I was
just<00:04:42.040> so<00:04:42.220> disappointed<00:04:42.880> with<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.150> ending

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
just so disappointed with the ending

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.240 
just so disappointed with the ending
because<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.930> was<00:04:44.110> seriously<00:04:44.500> looking<00:04:44.800> forward

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
because I was seriously looking forward

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.970 
because I was seriously looking forward
to<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:46.120> long<00:04:46.420> I<00:04:46.840> just<00:04:47.440> had<00:04:47.560> such<00:04:47.770> high

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
to this for so long I just had such high

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.530 
to this for so long I just had such high
expectations<00:04:48.340> because<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.030> was<00:04:49.150> such<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.330> good

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
expectations because it was such a good

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.370 
expectations because it was such a good
series<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.170> then<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:51.490> was<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.170> didn't

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
series and then that was it and I didn't

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.050 
series and then that was it and I didn't
feel<00:04:53.500> anything<00:04:53.560> at<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.100> end<00:04:54.130> other<00:04:54.910> than

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
feel anything at the end other than

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.300 
feel anything at the end other than
disappointment<00:04:55.690> but<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.260> really<00:04:56.860> don't<00:04:57.130> want

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
disappointment but I really don't want

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.700 
disappointment but I really don't want
