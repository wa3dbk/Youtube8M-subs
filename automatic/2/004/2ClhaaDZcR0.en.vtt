00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:02.980
 Leon Fernandez 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.230
 evaluation of motorist protection systems to guarantee the 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.230
 higher levels of helmet safety 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.780
 is about to see are carried out in the euro facilities 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.210
 for research and development of motorist protection systems and 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.710
 ensures that the most demanding tests are passed 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.789
 has obtained the certificate of three 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 ep3 means that the case is approved in Italy 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 one of the most demanding countries in the approval of the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.430
 one of the mechanical characteristics of the screen 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.590
 the screens have to withstand impacts like those that can be produced 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.950
 running or in case of accident 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.460
 the test consists of throwing a mass of three kilograms from one meter in height 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.100
 light on a punch of zero like 3 kilograms in which it will impact on the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 screen previously conditioned at minus 20 degrees centigrade 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 3 of the optical units and abrasion resistance 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.600
 To evaluate the treatment against scratches of the mountain, 3 kilograms are poured 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.940
 of explosive material on the moving screen 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.410
 the optical qualities of the screen are emitted before and after the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.950
 operation 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.479
 Verifying that the quality of the vision remains within the limits are 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.070
 before the reform 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.570
 one to the screens did not plan to go public we are fools this son of 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.050
 refugees ferine astigmatic of the screen there you have conditions 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.579
 continued with the one that is measured through the screen 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.559
 the victims located at a distance of four steps back aznar 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.429
 determination of the difference of resolving power binoculars 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.929
 a beam of light is thrown or not about eight meters from the screen measuring its 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.929
 projection are a goal located behind it 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.929
 artest of the spectral transmission of the screen 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.399
 plasma screens 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.489
 the color screens do not have to diminish the vision of the biker 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.439
 by means of the spectrophotometer it is verified that this treatment of 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 screen does not alter vision 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.449
 before withholdings 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.189
 it was found that the helmet does not discover the protected area of ​​the head 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.549
 a wide device with a mass of three kilograms 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.119
 fits on the back of the helmet 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.229
 a mass of 10 kilograms is dropped from a height of 0 to 5 meters 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.389
 the dynamic test of the retention system 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.779
 through this test it is verified that the case is not realistic and that in case of 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:36.859
 impact is applied one more than 100 kilograms at a height of 750 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.849
 millimeters measuring the displacement 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.849
 the prosecutor of the Gürtel case and the resistance of the withholding system 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 rivets and locking systems 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.849
 Stiffness test of outer shell 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.249
 the shell of the helmet undergoes attention checking its deformation and 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.299
 assuring us that the recovery of the carlota is within the 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.299
 requirements demanded by the standard 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.370
 3 impact absorption 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.660
 the norm that demands the marking of the points of impact on the helmet 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.660
 following the criteria specified in it 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.000
 the impact tests 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.150
 they kill at extreme temperatures in order at least 20 days 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.650
 data and hot plus 50 degrees centigrade castro flat surfaces and 

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.649
 fight 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.639
 The test head contains sensors that measure the affectation suffered by the 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.430
 head in a time interval during the impact 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.550
 with these values ​​the country is calculated it is said criteria of head injury 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.009
 in development helmets to fully enjoy the bike with total 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:38.210
 security
