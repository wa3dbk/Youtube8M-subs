00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
nothing else to really say about them

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.460 
nothing else to really say about them
besides<00:06:17.610> that<00:06:17.790> they're<00:06:18.300> not<00:06:18.390> broken<00:06:18.660> which<00:06:19.320> is

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
besides that they're not broken which is

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.010 
besides that they're not broken which is
a<00:06:20.090> nice<00:06:21.090> thing<00:06:21.270> about<00:06:21.330> black<00:06:21.600> beans<00:06:21.780> I<00:06:21.870> don't

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
a nice thing about black beans I don't

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.970 
a nice thing about black beans I don't
feel<00:06:22.110> that<00:06:22.260> any<00:06:22.380> of<00:06:22.470> the<00:06:22.530> cards<00:06:22.800> in<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:22.950> deck

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
feel that any of the cards in the deck

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.220 
feel that any of the cards in the deck
are<00:06:23.250> broken<00:06:23.670> aside<00:06:24.450> for<00:06:24.630> maybe<00:06:24.810> black

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
are broken aside for maybe black

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.530

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
cards which hopefully will mean that

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.080 
cards which hopefully will mean that
they<00:06:31.080> don't<00:06:31.110> get<00:06:31.500> hit<00:06:32.250> any<00:06:32.400> further<00:06:32.640> than<00:06:33.000> they

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
or gb is right now it's a very balanced

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.570 
or gb is right now it's a very balanced
deck<00:06:42.840> and<00:06:43.139> it's<00:06:43.530> going<00:06:43.620> to<00:06:43.680> stay<00:06:43.740> around<00:06:44.160> and

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
deck and it's going to stay around and

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
be a good deck for a long time if they

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.280 
be a good deck for a long time if they
don't<00:06:48.240> do<00:06:48.360> anything<00:06:48.570> else<00:06:48.720> to<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:48.990> deck<00:06:49.139> if

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
don't do anything else to the deck if

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.950 
don't do anything else to the deck if
they<00:06:49.440> give<00:06:50.070> it<00:06:50.190> more<00:06:50.340> support<00:06:50.940> do<00:06:51.690> something

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
with a banned list obviously that will

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.240
