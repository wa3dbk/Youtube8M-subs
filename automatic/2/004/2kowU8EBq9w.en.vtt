00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.060 
you do notes as a massive difference
it<00:01:01.610> creates<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.240> feeling<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.050> skin<00:01:03.350> can

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
it creates a feeling that the skin can

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.190 
it creates a feeling that the skin can
breathe<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.850> wasn't<00:01:05.180> too<00:01:05.300> rich<00:01:05.510> there's<00:01:05.960> very

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.499 

it's<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.100> difficult<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.390> an

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it's very difficult to get an

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.940 
it's very difficult to get an
exfoliation<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.289> because<00:01:19.590> sometimes

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
exfoliation right because sometimes

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
they're too hard and if you use them too

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.810 
they're too hard and if you use them too
much<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.380> quite<00:01:22.950> sensitive<00:01:23.219> do<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
much and this is quite sensitive do you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149 
much and this is quite sensitive do you
push<00:01:24.060> an<00:01:24.240> exfoliation<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.320> lasts<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> the
