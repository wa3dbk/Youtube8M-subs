00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
far we've come on the development for

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.090 
far we've come on the development for
signage<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.989> mod<00:00:43.140> tend<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> run<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.950> this

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
signage and mod tend to run on this

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
signage and mod tend to run on this
device<00:00:44.539> as<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
device as you can see right here this is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
device as you can see right here this is
clockwork<00:00:47.760> recovery<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:51.270> something

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
clockwork recovery this is something

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.250 
clockwork recovery this is something
that<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.199> used<00:00:53.360> after<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.750> around<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that is used after you get around the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
that is used after you get around the
bootloader<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.129> bootloader<00:00:56.460> has<00:00:56.760> been

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
bootloader the bootloader has been

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.360 
bootloader the bootloader has been
unlocked<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> ability<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
unlocked and so we have the ability to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.420 
unlocked and so we have the ability to
put<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.760> recovery<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.250> I'm<00:01:02.250> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
put this recovery on it and I'm just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
put this recovery on it and I'm just
going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.789> I've<00:01:03.120> already<00:01:03.510> installed<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
going to I've already installed it and

you what occurs now there are still some
quite<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> ways<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:14.880> see

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
quite a ways to go as you can see

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510 
quite a ways to go as you can see
there's<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:16.100> glitchyness<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
there's a little glitchyness here this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.499 
there's a little glitchyness here this
is<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.150> result<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.130> well<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.030> believe<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
is a result of well what we believe to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.730 
is a result of well what we believe to
be<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> resolution<00:01:22.409> issue<00:01:24.380> once<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.590> goes

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
be just a resolution issue once it goes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
be just a resolution issue once it goes
into<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.280> you'll<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
into and you'll see in here just in a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.990 
into and you'll see in here just in a
moment<00:01:27.470> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> fun<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.549> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
moment this is a lot of fun to see I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
moment this is a lot of fun to see I
could<00:01:30.540> watch<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.110> day<00:01:31.170> long<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
could watch this all day long I think on

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.149 
could watch this all day long I think on
this<00:01:32.520> tablet<00:01:32.850> anyway<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> guys<00:01:35.100> know

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
this tablet anyway just so you guys know

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.780 
this tablet anyway just so you guys know
this<00:01:35.909> build<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.619> rough<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this build is very very rough this is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.590 
this build is very very rough this is
based<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.110> work<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.650> has<00:01:40.770> been<00:01:40.920> done<00:01:40.979> by

based on the work that has been done by

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.990 
based on the work that has been done by
Green<00:01:42.600> who<00:01:43.070> has<00:01:44.990> chosen<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.409> 8.9<00:01:47.220> inch<00:01:47.250> tablet

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
Green who has chosen the 8.9 inch tablet

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.859 
Green who has chosen the 8.9 inch tablet
as<00:01:48.840> his<00:01:49.229> development<00:01:50.030> area<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.750> I'm

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
as his development area and what I'm

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.700 
as his development area and what I'm
going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.770> he<00:01:53.040> does<00:01:53.780> his<00:01:54.780> magic<00:01:55.590> on

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
going to do is as he does his magic on

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520 
going to do is as he does his magic on
that<00:01:55.950> device<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.939> pork<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.170> over

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that device I will pork when I can over

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.910 
that device I will pork when I can over
here<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> seven-inch<00:01:59.640> tablet<00:02:00.920> there

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here to the seven-inch tablet there

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
here to the seven-inch tablet there
would<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.219> been<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.850> subtle<00:02:03.270> differences

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
would have been some subtle differences

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.810 
would have been some subtle differences
that<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.990> had<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.409> worked<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.890> over<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that have had to be worked out over the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.029 
that have had to be worked out over the
course<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.210> doing<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
course of doing this so it is going to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.880 
course of doing this so it is going to
be<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> slow<00:02:08.459> process<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> coming<00:02:09.690> along

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
be a slow process but it is coming along

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.190 
be a slow process but it is coming along
in<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.039> opinion<00:02:11.520> fairly<00:02:12.239> well

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
in my opinion fairly well

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500 
in my opinion fairly well
to<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.410> point<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.099> just<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> give<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.330> an

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
to this point so just to give you an

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.990 
to this point so just to give you an
example<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.129> full<00:02:17.550> working

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
example here we do have full working

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.210 
example here we do have full working
touch<00:02:18.209> screen<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:19.560> was<00:02:19.709> something<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.069> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
touch screen that was something that I

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
Birds was working so I feel the need to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.690 
Birds was working so I feel the need to
duplicate<00:03:01.170> his<00:03:01.200> process<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.489> show

duplicate his process here just to show
that<00:03:02.730> we're<00:03:03.000> kind<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.239> on<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> same<00:03:03.690> page

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
that we're kind of on the same page

you'll notice that my soft keys are
staying<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.670> screen<00:03:08.970> here

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
staying on the screen here

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.600 
staying on the screen here
not<00:03:10.380> exactly<00:03:10.739> sure<00:03:10.980> where<00:03:11.160> that's<00:03:11.340> coming

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
not exactly sure where that's coming

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.520 
not exactly sure where that's coming
from<00:03:11.760> I'll<00:03:12.329> work<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.019> ensure<00:03:13.380> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
from I'll work that out of ensure it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.410 
from I'll work that out of ensure it's
just<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.799> subtle<00:03:14.130> little<00:03:14.250> thing<00:03:14.579> but<00:03:15.030> see<00:03:15.299> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
just a subtle little thing but see you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.440 
just a subtle little thing but see you
can<00:03:15.599> see<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.290> working<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:17.340> fine

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
can see that this is working just fine

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.030 
can see that this is working just fine
just<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.900> did<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.230> his<00:03:19.440> building<00:03:19.709> and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
just like you did in his building and

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.830 
just like you did in his building and
this<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.280> basically<00:03:20.850> his<00:03:21.060> build<00:03:21.389> all<00:03:21.660> I've

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
this is basically his build all I've

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.449 
this is basically his build all I've
done<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.799> what<00:03:22.980> needed<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.370> done

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
done is just do what needed to be done

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.470 
done is just do what needed to be done
to<00:03:23.609> make<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.060> work

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
to make it work

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.020 
to make it work
for<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:26.190> device<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.400> see<00:03:29.639> look<00:03:29.850> I

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
for this device so you can see look I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.559 
for this device so you can see look I
just<00:03:31.160> threw<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.930> luke<00:03:33.930> away<00:03:34.829> here<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.340> go<00:03:35.569> all

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
just threw a luke away here we go all

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.720 
just threw a luke away here we go all
right<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.930> essentially<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:38.280> know<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
right so essentially you know it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.569 
right so essentially you know it
demonstrates<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.630> does<00:03:39.780> work<00:03:40.019> just<00:03:40.049> fine

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
demonstrates that it does work just fine

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.449 
demonstrates that it does work just fine
I'll<00:03:41.579> go<00:03:41.790> ahead<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.180> press<00:03:42.359> home<00:03:42.930> here

I'll go ahead and press home here

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.190 
I'll go ahead and press home here
because<00:03:44.459> everybody<00:03:44.900> knows<00:03:45.900> how<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.109> play

one thing that I've noticed on this

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.960 
one thing that I've noticed on this
build<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.329> I'm<00:03:57.329> sure<00:03:57.569> it's<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:57.780> a

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
build that I'm sure it's just a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.370 
build that I'm sure it's just a
something<00:03:59.970> silly<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.569> I'm<00:04:00.690> missing<00:04:01.049> here<00:04:01.200> is

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.099 
something silly that I'm missing here is
that<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:02.459> screen<00:04:02.790> appears<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.630> smaller

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
that the screen appears to be smaller

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.770 
that the screen appears to be smaller
than<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.220> actual<00:04:05.730> tablet<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.299> when<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> switch

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
it just you know just a quick

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.120 
it just you know just a quick
demonstration<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:30.410> where<00:05:30.590> we<00:05:30.710> are<00:05:30.920> I<00:05:30.950> mean

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
demonstration of where we are I mean

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.970 
demonstration of where we are I mean
it's<00:05:31.400> actually<00:05:31.790> sort<00:05:32.390> of<00:05:32.800> functional<00:05:33.800> I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
it's actually sort of functional I

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.460 
it's actually sort of functional I
suppose<00:05:34.550> at<00:05:35.060> this<00:05:35.210> point<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:35.780> at<00:05:36.140> least<00:05:36.260> it

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
suppose at this point so at least it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.570 
suppose at this point so at least it
looks<00:05:36.620> like<00:05:36.800> something<00:05:37.190> we're<00:05:37.310> used<00:05:37.490> to

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
looks like something we're used to

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.660 
looks like something we're used to
seeing<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.330> that's<00:05:38.600> what<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.870> like<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.170> hear<00:05:39.320> so

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
seeing and that's what I like to hear so

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.480 
seeing and that's what I like to hear so
I<00:05:40.930> guess<00:05:41.930> that's<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.290> so<00:05:42.470> I'll<00:05:42.830> go<00:05:43.190> ahead<00:05:43.220> and

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
I guess that's it so I'll go ahead and

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.080 
I guess that's it so I'll go ahead and
leave<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.670> at<00:05:43.730> that

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
leave it at that

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.720 
leave it at that
