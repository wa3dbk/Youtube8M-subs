that<00:00:57.940> was<00:00:58.000> safer<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.629> easier<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.440> drive<00:00:59.680> while

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
that was safer and easier to drive while

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.369 
that was safer and easier to drive while
matching<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.940> comfort<00:01:01.390> levels<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.930> the

so<00:01:06.369> how<00:01:06.729> did<00:01:06.880> he<00:01:06.970> plan<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.360> achieve<00:01:07.450> this

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
so how did he plan to achieve this

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.910 
so how did he plan to achieve this
miracle<00:01:08.729> using<00:01:09.729> war<00:01:09.970> technology<00:01:10.740> bombers<00:01:11.740> to

factory<00:01:22.020> bombers<00:01:23.020> had<00:01:23.259> to<00:01:23.350> be<00:01:23.470> fast<00:01:23.800> strong

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429

factory bombers had to be fast strong
and<00:01:24.729> light<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:26.020> they<00:01:26.140> used<00:01:26.380> loads<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:27.009> this

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.469 
stuff aluminium attached to lightweight
frames<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:36.009> Durand<00:01:36.429> decided<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.209> build<00:01:37.390> his

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.300 
frames so Durand decided to build his
new<00:01:37.630> bus<00:01:38.080> like<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> Halifax<00:01:39.190> bomber<00:01:41.190> taking<00:01:42.190> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
new bus like a Halifax bomber taking the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
but there was one crucial test that

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.520 
but there was one crucial test that
would<00:04:17.850> really<00:04:18.120> show<00:04:18.299> whether<00:04:18.810> Durant<00:04:19.290> had
