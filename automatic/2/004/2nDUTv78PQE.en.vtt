you're gonna act as our flour and we're

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.140 
you're gonna act as our flour and we're
gonna<00:00:39.320> be<00:00:39.530> using<00:00:39.710> dates<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:41.510> sweeten<00:00:42.400> so<00:00:43.400> let's

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
gonna be using dates to sweeten so let's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.950 
gonna be using dates to sweeten so let's
first<00:00:44.450> start<00:00:44.630> by<00:00:45.020> taking<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.920> bag<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.960> dark

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
first start by taking a bag of dark

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.840 
first start by taking a bag of dark
chocolate<00:00:48.020> chips<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.890> I<00:00:49.130> really<00:00:49.400> like<00:00:49.640> these

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
chocolate chips and I really like these

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.460 
chocolate chips and I really like these
because<00:00:50.270> they're<00:00:50.450> sixty<00:00:50.810> percent<00:00:50.960> cacao

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
because they're sixty percent cacao

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.800 
because they're sixty percent cacao
which<00:00:51.770> means<00:00:51.980> they<00:00:52.100> have<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.250> lot<00:00:52.310> of<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.480> cacao

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
which means they have a lot of the cacao

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.840 
which means they have a lot of the cacao
in<00:00:53.990> them<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:54.890> we're<00:00:55.160> gonna<00:00:55.220> take<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:55.700> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
in them so we're gonna take this and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.880 
in them so we're gonna take this and
we're<00:00:55.940> gonna<00:00:56.000> microwave<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.200> best<00:00:57.470> way<00:00:57.650> to<00:00:57.680> do

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
we're gonna microwave the best way to do

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.520 
we're gonna microwave the best way to do
it<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.220> a<00:00:58.310> flux<00:00:58.730> or<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.540> kind<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.870> white<00:01:00.110> flat

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
it is in a flux or a kind of white flat

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.010 
it is in a flux or a kind of white flat
Bowl<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.640> we're<00:01:01.850> gonna<00:01:02.110> warm<00:01:03.110> this<00:01:03.320> up<00:01:03.729> or<00:01:05.020> one

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
Bowl so we're gonna warm this up or one

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.800

minute<00:01:06.409> in<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:07.429> microwave<00:01:07.479> so<00:01:08.479> now<00:01:08.569> you<00:01:08.630> can

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
minute in the microwave so now you can

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.219 
minute in the microwave so now you can
see<00:01:09.049> that<00:01:09.229> they're<00:01:09.409> not<00:01:09.439> exactly<00:01:10.340> all<00:01:11.229> liquid

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
see that they're not exactly all liquid

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.109 
see that they're not exactly all liquid
but<00:01:12.740> they're<00:01:12.890> soft<00:01:13.189> enough<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.549> when<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:13.909> put

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
but they're soft enough that when I put

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.700 
but they're soft enough that when I put
them<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.420> blender<00:01:14.569> they're<00:01:15.319> gonna<00:01:15.409> blend

them in the blender they're gonna blend

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.020 
them in the blender they're gonna blend
so<00:01:15.859> I'm<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.069> gonna<00:01:16.159> let<00:01:16.429> these<00:01:16.549> cool<00:01:16.759> off

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
so I'm just gonna let these cool off

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.029
