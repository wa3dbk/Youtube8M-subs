00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
a right back and in the two CS

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.930

here's<00:05:43.360> your<00:05:43.540> hands<00:05:43.750> together<00:05:44.640> right<00:05:45.640> and

left<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.650> then<00:05:48.130> I've<00:05:48.250> got<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.790> chorus<00:05:51.690> but

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
left and then I've got the chorus but

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.240 
left and then I've got the chorus but
now<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:52.960> can't<00:05:53.230> play<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.620> as<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.740> single<00:05:54.130> note

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
now you can't play that as a single note

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.770 
now you can't play that as a single note
if<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.460> want<00:05:54.669> to<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:54.970> I've<00:05:55.060> got<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.330> listed

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
if you want to so I've got it listed

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:06.440 
if you want to so I've got it listed
both<00:05:56.169> way<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:01.270> sounds<00:06:01.600> better<00:06:01.690> with<00:06:01.900> two<00:06:02.050> notes

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450
