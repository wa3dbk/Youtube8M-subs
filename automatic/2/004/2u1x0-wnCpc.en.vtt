so<00:00:00.480> here<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.750> have<00:00:00.780> our<00:00:00.930> character<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:01.920> can

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so here we have our character we can

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.130 
so here we have our character we can
select<00:00:02.250> our<00:00:02.460> character<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.120> we<00:00:03.810> can<00:00:03.990> move

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
select our character and we can move

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.110 
select our character and we can move
them<00:00:04.290> out<00:00:04.440> they<00:00:05.430> can<00:00:05.490> move<00:00:05.670> them<00:00:05.819> up<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.000> down

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
them out they can move them up and down

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.849 
them out they can move them up and down
we<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.569> see<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.839> soft<00:00:07.020> shadowing<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.740> on

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
we can see the soft shadowing going on

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.980 
we can see the soft shadowing going on
on<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> floor<00:00:08.309> here<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.570> also<00:00:09.690> select

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
on the floor here and we can also select

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.709 
on the floor here and we can also select
our<00:00:10.440> ambient<00:00:10.800> occlusion<00:00:11.360> settings<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.480> we

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
our ambient occlusion settings here we

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
our ambient occlusion settings here we
can<00:00:12.870> mess<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.200> same<00:00:13.380> scale<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
can mess with the same scale as the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.279 
can mess with the same scale as the
distance<00:00:15.120> between<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.690> surfaces<00:00:15.870> before

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
distance between two surfaces before

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.859 
distance between two surfaces before
they<00:00:16.619> start<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> include<00:00:17.369> each<00:00:17.490> other<00:00:17.840> we<00:00:18.840> can

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
they start to include each other we can

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.330 
they start to include each other we can
change<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> ambit<00:00:19.500> blue<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.800> color<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:22.340> we

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
change the ambit blue in color and we

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.310 
change the ambit blue in color and we
can<00:00:23.490> also<00:00:23.609> change<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.539> sample<00:00:24.960> settings<00:00:25.230> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
can also change the sample settings that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
can also change the sample settings that
were<00:00:25.410> calculating<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.099> inclusion<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.640> now

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
were calculating of inclusion at now

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
were calculating of inclusion at now
this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> medium<00:00:28.170> sample<00:00:28.560> setting<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.400> our

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
this is a medium sample setting for our

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.970 
this is a medium sample setting for our
render<00:00:29.910> view<00:00:30.720> port<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.199> render<00:00:31.710> time<00:00:31.740> we

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
render view port at render time we

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.450 
render view port at render time we
actually<00:00:32.099> sample<00:00:32.640> much<00:00:32.790> higher<00:00:32.969> than<00:00:33.149> this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.000 

so<00:00:40.059> back<00:00:40.239> into<00:00:40.600> our<00:00:40.809> render<00:00:41.110> here<00:00:41.350> we<00:00:41.530> do<00:00:41.860> all

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
so back into our render here we do all

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.580 
so back into our render here we do all
of<00:00:42.040> our<00:00:42.540> lighting<00:00:43.540> here<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:43.989> my<00:00:44.110> studio<00:00:44.320> as

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
of our lighting here in my studio as

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.490 
of our lighting here in my studio as
well<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.210> we<00:00:46.300> can<00:00:46.390> go<00:00:46.480> ahead<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:46.690> grab<00:00:47.020> one<00:00:47.470> of

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
well so we can go ahead and grab one of

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.860 
well so we can go ahead and grab one of
our<00:00:47.710> key<00:00:47.860> lights

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.660 

we're<00:00:56.410> turn<00:00:56.559> on<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.800> icons<00:00:57.160> for<00:00:57.309> our<00:00:57.460> lights

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
we're turn on the icons for our lights

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.850 
we're turn on the icons for our lights
and<00:00:57.879> isolate<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.510> one<00:00:58.719> key<00:00:58.930> light<00:00:59.140> here

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.710 

if<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.430> select<00:01:02.490> this<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> turn<00:01:03.300> lights<00:01:03.510> back

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
if I select this and I turn lights back

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.160 
if I select this and I turn lights back
on<00:01:03.900> I<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.680> grab<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> light<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.080> move

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
on I can grab this light and I can move

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
on I can grab this light and I can move
it<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.440> viewport<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.550> shadows

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it in the viewport and we have shadows

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.400 
it in the viewport and we have shadows
and<00:01:09.240> light<00:01:09.360> everything<00:01:09.810> updating<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.380> real

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
and light everything updating in real

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.910 
and light everything updating in real
time<00:01:10.800> as<00:01:11.370> we're<00:01:11.610> working

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.100 

and<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:19.580> also<00:01:19.729> do<00:01:20.090> all<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.299> our<00:01:20.450> shader<00:01:20.689> setups

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and we also do all of our shader setups

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.649 
and we also do all of our shader setups
inside<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.500> box<00:01:21.740> studio<00:01:22.040> pro<00:01:22.299> so<00:01:23.299> if<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.479> just

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
inside a box studio pro so if I just

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.510 
inside a box studio pro so if I just
select<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.080> hair<00:01:24.619> of<00:01:24.650> our<00:01:24.890> character<00:01:25.280> hero

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
select the hair of our character hero

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.660 
select the hair of our character hero
but<00:01:26.649> we<00:01:27.649> can<00:01:27.770> go<00:01:27.860> ahead<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.220> can<00:01:28.369> start<00:01:28.520> moving

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
but we can go ahead we can start moving

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.080 
but we can go ahead we can start moving
around<00:01:29.060> specular<00:01:29.780> highlights<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.890> air

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
around specular highlights on on the air

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.190 
around specular highlights on on the air
say<00:01:32.090> we<00:01:32.180> want<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.420> change<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.750> color<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
say we want to change the color of the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.740 
say we want to change the color of the
hair<00:01:33.320> we<00:01:33.470> can<00:01:33.590> do<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.830> as<00:01:33.950> well<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:35.390> support

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750

surface now you see we automatically
change<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.360> topology<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.170> character<00:02:08.709> and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
change the topology of the character and

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.770 
change the topology of the character and
what<00:02:09.759> we<00:02:09.849> can<00:02:09.879> do<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.269> drive<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:10.660> this

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
what we can do is drive up this

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.589 
what we can do is drive up this
desolation<00:02:11.170> amount<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.790> very<00:02:12.970> quickly<00:02:13.209> we

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
desolation amount and very quickly we

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.920 
desolation amount and very quickly we
are<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.170> something<00:02:14.650> still<00:02:14.799> displacement<00:02:15.930> so

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
are to something still displacement so

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.420 
are to something still displacement so
we<00:02:17.019> get<00:02:17.140> out<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.319> wireframe<00:02:17.709> mode<00:02:17.860> will<00:02:18.129> add<00:02:18.280> or

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
we get out of wireframe mode will add or

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.009 
we get out of wireframe mode will add or
displacement<00:02:18.730> map<00:02:21.239> drive<00:02:22.239> up<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.810> place

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
displacement map drive up to this place

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.449 
displacement map drive up to this place
right<00:02:24.239> smooth<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.390> out<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> touch<00:02:26.340> hit<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
right smooth it out a touch hit the

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.750 
right smooth it out a touch hit the
render<00:02:27.700> button<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.299> then<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.569> have<00:02:28.750> real-time

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
render button and then we have real-time

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.490 
render button and then we have real-time
sub-pixel<00:02:30.760> displacement<00:02:31.180> map<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:32.140> see<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:32.380> we

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
sub-pixel displacement map and see if we

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.050 
sub-pixel displacement map and see if we
come<00:02:32.709> back<00:02:32.829> into<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.099> English<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.670> fast<00:02:33.819> so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
come back into the English and fast so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.910 
come back into the English and fast so
see<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:34.959> actual<00:02:35.260> real<00:02:35.410> geometry

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
see that this is actual real geometry

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.229 
see that this is actual real geometry
workload<00:02:36.250> we're<00:02:36.489> creating<00:02:36.819> this<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.060> not<00:02:37.209> a
