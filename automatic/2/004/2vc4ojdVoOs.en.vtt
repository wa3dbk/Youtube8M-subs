getting to the point though where it's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.029 
getting to the point though where it's
getting<00:00:20.580> very<00:00:21.150> difficult<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.869> keep

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
getting very difficult to keep

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.859 
getting very difficult to keep
choreographing<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.609> same<00:00:23.880> fight<00:00:24.269> scenes<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
have them look different and sometimes I

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.000 
have them look different and sometimes I
was<00:00:27.869> bringing<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> stand<00:00:28.740> why<00:00:28.949> are

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

what<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> visually

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
what it would be like to see it visually

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.870 
what it would be like to see it visually
as<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:16.259> outside<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.520> am<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.729> looking

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
as an outside of what what am I looking

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600 
as an outside of what what am I looking
for<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.420> am<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.600> trying<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.960> capture<00:01:19.369> if<00:01:20.369> there

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
for what am I trying to capture if there

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.289 
for what am I trying to capture if there
was<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> fight<00:01:21.090> scene<00:01:21.619> I<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:23.460> try<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
was a fight scene I would try to do it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.980 
was a fight scene I would try to do it
in<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.229> would<00:01:25.920> confuse<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.640> reader

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
in a way that would confuse the reader

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
in a way that would confuse the reader
because<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.680> real<00:01:28.829> life<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.549> often

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because then in the real life very often

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
because then in the real life very often
you<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:31.820> details<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.320> see

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you don't see the details you just see

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
you don't see the details you just see
action<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.610> don't<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:36.000> things<00:01:36.299> flying

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
action and you don't see things flying

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
action and you don't see things flying
much<00:01:37.189> else<00:01:38.189> rug<00:01:38.520> arms<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> legs<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.130> people

selling<00:01:41.549> over<00:01:41.820> tables<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.220> see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
selling over tables but you don't see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310

the<00:01:44.460> details<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> very<00:01:45.450> often<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.930> done<00:01:46.079> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the details and very often it's done in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.450 
the details and very often it's done in
a<00:01:46.770> dark<00:01:47.040> room<00:01:47.280> where<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.119> conveniency<00:01:48.780> less

a dark room where you conveniency less

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
a dark room where you conveniency less
but<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.729> exciting<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.630> more<00:01:51.840> dramatic

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
but it's exciting it's more dramatic

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.990 
but it's exciting it's more dramatic
that<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:53.790> keeps<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.899> viewer<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.409> edge<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
that way it keeps the viewer on edge I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.840 
that way it keeps the viewer on edge I
wanted<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> story<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.020> sort<00:01:58.439> of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
wanted the story to be sort of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.840 
wanted the story to be sort of
mystifying<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> sinister<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.490> was<00:02:02.490> working

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
mystifying and sinister I was working

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
mystifying and sinister I was working
for<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> older<00:02:03.390> crowd<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.439> probably

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
for the older crowd and I probably

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
for the older crowd and I probably
didn't<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> was<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:06.000> working<00:02:06.450> for

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
didn't know I was really working for

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.039 
didn't know I was really working for
