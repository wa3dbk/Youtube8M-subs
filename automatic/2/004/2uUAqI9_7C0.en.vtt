238<00:00:08.120> earlier<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.360> year<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.690> idea<00:00:10.230> of

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
238 earlier this year the idea of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
238 earlier this year the idea of
finishing<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:10.950> seven<00:00:11.340> wins<00:00:11.550> seemed

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
finishing with seven wins seemed

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.180 
finishing with seven wins seemed
ridiculous<00:00:12.690> early<00:00:13.410> season<00:00:13.830> expectations

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
ridiculous early season expectations

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400 
ridiculous early season expectations
gave<00:00:15.150> way<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.389> disappointment<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
gave way to disappointment as the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.140 
gave way to disappointment as the
Panthers<00:00:16.830> caught<00:00:17.010> off<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> slow<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
Panthers caught off to a slow start and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.849 
Panthers caught off to a slow start and
never<00:00:18.570> looked<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.140> they've<00:00:19.350> turn<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> around

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
never looked like they've turn it around

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189 
never looked like they've turn it around
but<00:00:20.789> sure<00:00:21.029> enough<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> second<00:00:21.930> half<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
but sure enough in the second half of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.540 
but sure enough in the second half of
the<00:00:22.289> season<00:00:22.439> things<00:00:22.920> started<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.369> come

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the season things started to come

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
the season things started to come
together<00:00:23.670> Cam<00:00:24.449> Newton<00:00:24.840> became<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> much<00:00:25.380> better

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
together Cam Newton became a much better

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.740 
together Cam Newton became a much better
quarterback<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.609> offensive<00:00:27.150> line<00:00:27.180> became

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
quarterback the offensive line became

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
quarterback the offensive line became
the<00:00:27.960> better<00:00:28.140> blockers<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.369> defense

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the better blockers and the defense

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.179 
the better blockers and the defense
actually<00:00:30.210> improved<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> top<00:00:31.050> 10<00:00:31.380> unit<00:00:31.830> which

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
actually improved to a top 10 unit which

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.069 
actually improved to a top 10 unit which
have<00:00:32.340> looked<00:00:32.550> impossible<00:00:32.910> earlier<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
have looked impossible earlier in the

have looked impossible earlier in the
season<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:35.010> Sunday<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.090> three<00:00:36.480> Mike

Tolbert<00:00:37.079> touchdowns<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.219> were<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
Tolbert touchdowns that really were the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
Tolbert touchdowns that really were the
difference<00:00:38.910> Carolina<00:00:39.870> allowed<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> lot<00:00:40.559> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
difference Carolina allowed a lot of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
difference Carolina allowed a lot of
yards<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.670> their<00:00:41.820> ground<00:00:42.090> game

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
yards but it was their ground game

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
yards but it was their ground game
between<00:00:42.950> DeAngelo<00:00:43.950> Williams<00:00:43.980> running<00:00:44.789> the

bowl and then Tolbert punching it in
that<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.309> made<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.910> difference<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that really made the difference in the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.770 
that really made the difference in the

heard<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.330> before<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.899> last<00:02:10.349> year<00:02:10.619> we

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
heard this all before and last year we

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.380 
heard this all before and last year we
entered<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.190> season<00:02:11.250> saying<00:02:11.970> many<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.299> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
entered this season saying many of the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.630 
entered this season saying many of the
same<00:02:12.569> things<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.829> time<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.610> really

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
same things but this time it really

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.789 
same things but this time it really
looks<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.750> Carolina<00:02:16.170> Panthers<00:02:16.620> are

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
looks like the Carolina Panthers are

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.710 
looks like the Carolina Panthers are
putting<00:02:17.160> things<00:02:17.430> together<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.000> could<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
putting things together and could be a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.680 
putting things together and could be a
playoff<00:02:19.260> team<00:02:19.700> get<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:20.879> players<00:02:21.150> healthy

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
make some smart drafting and use the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180 
make some smart drafting and use the
little<00:02:24.989> amount<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.349> money<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> Panthers<00:02:26.010> have

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
little amount of money the Panthers have

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.770 
little amount of money the Panthers have
in<00:02:26.340> free<00:02:26.549> agency<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.150> make<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.329> couple<00:02:27.690> of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
in free agency to make a couple of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.319 
in free agency to make a couple of
difference<00:02:28.110> makers<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.640> could<00:02:29.910> be<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
difference makers and this could be the

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.420 
difference makers and this could be the
start<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.720> something<00:02:30.780> special<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.590> Carolina<00:02:32.069> a
