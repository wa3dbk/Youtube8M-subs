00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
go to my way to save so basically this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.070 
go to my way to save so basically this
game<00:00:24.359> runs<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.500> absolutely<00:00:26.279> zero<00:00:26.760> lag<00:00:27.080> well

game runs with absolutely zero lag well
not<00:00:28.710> zero<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.359> probably<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> perfect

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380

dash 50 60 FPS and right now it's a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
dash 50 60 FPS and right now it's a
little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.520> tacky<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.500> i<00:01:10.619> said<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
little bit tacky but that like i said is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.910 
little bit tacky but that like i said is
because<00:01:11.220> i'm<00:01:11.310> recording<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.320> play<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
because i'm recording on you can play a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.050 
because i'm recording on you can play a
portrait<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> landscape<00:01:15.479> modes<00:01:16.140> um

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
portrait and landscape modes um

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.690 
portrait and landscape modes um
landscape<00:01:18.060> seems<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.990> lot<00:01:19.170> faster<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.950> i

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
landscape seems to be a lot faster and i

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.780 
landscape seems to be a lot faster and i
am<00:01:20.909> using<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> default<00:01:22.430> settings<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.759> it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
am using the default settings so it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.359 
am using the default settings so it
could<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:25.200> could<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.500> possible<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.189> this

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
could it could be possible that this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
could it could be possible that this
game<00:01:26.610> could<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.360> tweaked<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.840> run<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.320> even

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
game could be tweaked to run even even

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
game could be tweaked to run even even
faster<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.509> even<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.140> great<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> right

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
faster which is even more great so right

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
faster which is even more great so right
now<00:01:33.659> i'm<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.560> point<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> game<00:01:35.600> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
now i'm up to this point in the game so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.109 
now i'm up to this point in the game so
it's<00:01:36.750> completely<00:01:36.930> playable<00:01:37.829> um<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.640> haven't

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's completely playable um I haven't

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.980 
it's completely playable um I haven't
been<00:01:39.360> uh<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.890> stuck<00:01:41.189> only<00:01:41.610> once<00:01:41.880> uh<00:01:42.240> were

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
been uh I was stuck only once uh were

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
been uh I was stuck only once uh were
like<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.530> didn't<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
like I didn't know what to do but I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
like I didn't know what to do but I
figured<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.899> great<00:01:49.170> game<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
figured it out and so this great game is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.429 
figured it out and so this great game is
great<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.090> loved<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.840> ps1

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.139 
you'll you you love it for your on your
ipod<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:58.460> disadvantage<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.579> game<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
ipod to the disadvantage of this game is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
ipod to the disadvantage of this game is
the<00:02:00.630> sound<00:02:00.990> makes<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.040> super<00:02:02.880> laggy<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.600> um<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the sound makes it super laggy so um it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.369 
the sound makes it super laggy so um it
goes<00:02:04.799> down<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:06.110> 15<00:02:07.110> dash<00:02:08.569> 20<00:02:09.569> frames<00:02:10.080> per

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
goes down to 15 dash 20 frames per

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.890 
goes down to 15 dash 20 frames per
second<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.190> sound<00:02:11.459> o<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
second with the sound o and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.960 
second with the sound o and
while<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.200> doesn't<00:02:14.230> make<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.129> variant

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
while it doesn't make it a variant

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.160 
while it doesn't make it a variant
playable<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.110> becomes<00:02:17.620> very<00:02:18.430> slow<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.569> if

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
playable on it becomes very slow and if

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.670 
playable on it becomes very slow and if
you're<00:02:20.439> used<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.829> playing<00:02:20.980> without<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.610> sound

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
you're used to playing without the sound

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.830 
you're used to playing without the sound
um<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.489> can<00:02:24.670> see<00:02:24.909> it's<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.599> really

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
um and you can see it's going really

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.920 
um and you can see it's going really
fast<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.769> well<00:02:27.310> actually<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.689> don't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
fast so well actually I do if you don't

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.869 
fast so well actually I do if you don't
start<00:02:29.140> playing<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.709> um<00:02:29.950> I'd<00:02:30.190> recommend<00:02:30.670> you

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
start playing it um I'd recommend you

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.610 
start playing it um I'd recommend you
started<00:02:31.299> playing<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.720> with<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.019> sound<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
started playing it with the sound and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.190 
started playing it with the sound and
tweak<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.640> settings<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.299> it's<00:02:34.450> as<00:02:34.690> fast<00:02:34.930> as

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
tweak the settings so it's as fast as

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.979 
tweak the settings so it's as fast as
possible<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.579> sound<00:02:36.879> but<00:02:37.180> if<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.750> start

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
possible with the sound but if you start

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.289 
possible with the sound but if you start
playing<00:02:38.170> without<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.829> sound<00:02:39.099> LLL<00:02:39.459> see<00:02:40.030> my

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
playing without the sound LLL see my

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.390 
playing without the sound LLL see my
super<00:02:41.019> slow<00:02:41.290> when<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.739> play<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.220> sound

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
super slow when you play with the sound

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.930 
super slow when you play with the sound
so<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.900> got<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.200> use<00:02:47.409> three<00:02:48.250> fingers<00:02:48.280> with

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
so you got to use three fingers with

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.250 
so you got to use three fingers with
this<00:02:49.120> game<00:02:49.390> sort<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:51.190> whenever<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.909> are
