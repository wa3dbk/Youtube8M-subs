00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.239
 Hello children 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.850
 I 'm back garden today we will 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.129
 A supercool castle was built 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 built and used earlier in the Middle Ages 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.449
 around queens queens and princesses 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.760
 to protect against attacking armies 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.739
 as soon as an army arrived, the gates were opened 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.050
 open it all in the box 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.480
 could protect and then closed 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 if the army could pull off the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 gates are reopened and all 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.909
 could go outside 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.559
 because the walls are so tall and thick 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.719
 and everyone was safe 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.550
 it was protected by the super 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.960
 To build a cool castle you need the following 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.960
 materials and tools 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.300
 if you have all the materials and tools 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.560
 Together you have found yours once 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.560
 cut out the pictures 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.170
 once you have cut out everything 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.170
 we can start tinkering with the castle 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.100
 take your glue stick and glue yours 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 coat of arms on the bank 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.890
 in the manual is that you also the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.000
 walls of your castle on your muesli carton 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.000
 The walls can become sticky 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.450
 extra firm but you do not have to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 do 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.000
 the walls are also without the cardboard 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.769
 now you stick the roof of the towers in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.049
 this cone shape ensures that the 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.640
 Roofs are the same height as the towers 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.640
 afterwards are at the same height 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.700
 Then you make the four towers in the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:43.970
 her the paper cylinder shaped 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:46.250
 set if you with the towers 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.220
 finished you can start the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.960
 fold your turn to fold 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.530
 You just have to have those little ones 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.520
 folding black lines on the walls 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.520
 simply passes them as to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.209
 Now you have the wall Neuerburg towers 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:16.420
 built and at the same time the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:20.489
 basis of your castle the two short ones 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.489
 Parts are for the sides of your castle 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.530
 this long part is for the back 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.930
 and this piece here with the gate in front 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.930
 on it is the front of your castle 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.990
 now we have the towers to the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.990
 bring the right things 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.700
 For that we give the turn to the towers 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.700
 the castle 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.849
 as I said you can here 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.859
 like also the walls by cardboard of 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.450
 reinforce your cereal packaging but 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.450
 it's not necessary 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.290
 and always think about enough glue 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.070
 use around the different parts 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.810
 neatly stick to each other now 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.770
 It is important that the drawbridge 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.770
 is cut 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.930
 so she can go up and down like that 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.010
 just as great 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.620
 Now comes a bit of glue up here 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:39.160
 on it and already we can the roofs 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:45.550
 Sticking the towers presses the roof now 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.530
 so in the right place exactly the same 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.480
 can you now for the other towers 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.600
 do 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.550
 and we're done with the couple 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.440
 you can share your extra here 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.440
 Decorate castle as you like 

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:27.919
 Now I can make my princess 

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:35.599
 The easiest way is when you put them in 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:38.349
 the middle once kinks then I click 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.349
 the change 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.740
 make glue on the surface 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.429
 and stick it on 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.990
 Now we have our princess and 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.870
 our castle is ready you can the gate 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.060
 open the princess bring that in 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.190
 close the gate and start over 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.580
 play 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.580
 very easily 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.490
 I hope you had fun with this castle 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.170
 to tinker with today and I hope you soon 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.740
 to see again in the board world 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.740
 bye
