00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
just said that earlier in the video for

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.869 
just said that earlier in the video for
about<00:04:46.470> um<00:04:48.300> 25<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.479> 35<00:04:49.960> minutes<00:04:50.490> I'm<00:04:51.490> gonna<00:04:51.669> put

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
about um 25 to 35 minutes I'm gonna put

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.520 
about um 25 to 35 minutes I'm gonna put
it<00:04:51.970> in<00:04:52.030> for<00:04:52.240> 25<00:04:52.599> minutes<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.020> check<00:04:53.199> it<00:04:53.379> now

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
it in for 25 minutes and check it now

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.740 
it in for 25 minutes and check it now
let's<00:04:54.129> just<00:04:54.310> see<00:04:54.699> how<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.090> looks<00:04:55.449> at<00:04:55.599> that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
let's just see how it looks at that

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:05.700 
let's just see how it looks at that
point<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:01.330> can<00:05:02.259> tell<00:05:02.500> for<00:05:02.800> sure<00:05:04.470> it's<00:05:05.470> done

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
point I can tell for sure it's done

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.800 
point I can tell for sure it's done
because<00:05:06.129> it's<00:05:06.669> burning<00:05:07.090> around<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.360> edges<00:05:07.659> I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
because it's burning around the edges I

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.420 
because it's burning around the edges I
try<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.020> get<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.289> out<00:05:08.349> a<00:05:08.590> little<00:05:08.770> bit<00:05:09.039> before<00:05:09.400> it

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
try to get it out a little bit before it

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.809 
try to get it out a little bit before it
at<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.789> point<00:05:10.060> but<00:05:11.069> um<00:05:12.069> I<00:05:12.370> guess<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.699> was

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
at that point but um I guess it was

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.840 
at that point but um I guess it was
actually<00:05:13.150> done<00:05:13.300> probably<00:05:13.539> around
