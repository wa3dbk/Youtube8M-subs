are very important i think we will see
in<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> device<00:00:30.300> come<00:00:31.109> march<00:00:31.439> first<00:00:31.769> number

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
in the device come march first number

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
in the device come march first number
one<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.410> galaxy

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
one now the first thing about the galaxy

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
one now the first thing about the galaxy
s6<00:00:35.160> especially<00:00:35.760> from<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> tweets

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
s6 especially from all the tweets

s6 especially from all the tweets
Samsung<00:00:36.960> ascent<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.440> actually<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.070> things

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
Samsung ascent are actually two things

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.910 
Samsung ascent are actually two things
together<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.329> put<00:00:39.540> an<00:00:39.780> improved<00:00:40.620> camera

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
together I will put an improved camera

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.180 
together I will put an improved camera
and<00:00:41.399> improve<00:00:41.879> performance<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> galaxy<00:00:43.680> s6

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and improve performance so the galaxy s6

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
and improve performance so the galaxy s6
will<00:00:44.430> improve<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> camera<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
will improve from the camera from the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
will improve from the camera from the
galaxy<00:00:46.110> s5<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> i<00:00:47.070> also<00:00:47.190> would<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.550> i<00:00:47.610> think

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
galaxy s5 and i also would think i think

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
galaxy s5 and i also would think i think
we'll<00:00:48.000> take<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> step<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.660> above<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> Galaxy

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
we'll take a step on above the Galaxy

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.340 
we'll take a step on above the Galaxy
Note<00:00:49.739> 4<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.230> gonna

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Note 4 now we do know that it's gonna

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
Note 4 now we do know that it's gonna
have<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> minimum<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.430> 16<00:00:53.789> megapixel<00:00:53.879> camera

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
have a minimum of a 16 megapixel camera

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
have a minimum of a 16 megapixel camera
because<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> course<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> should<00:00:56.129> match<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
because of course it should match the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.500 
because of course it should match the
camera<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> Galaxy<00:00:57.899> Note<00:00:57.930> 4<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.359> we<00:01:00.359> do

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
camera from the Galaxy Note 4 and we do

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
camera from the Galaxy Note 4 and we do
know<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> Samsung<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> improve

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
know that Samsung is going to improve

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
know that Samsung is going to improve
the<00:01:02.340> objects<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.850> terms<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.180> software<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the objects in terms of software and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
the objects in terms of software and
some<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.769> other<00:01:04.920> features<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> camera

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
some some other features on the camera

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.160 
some some other features on the camera
so<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> would<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.840> improved

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so we know this would be very improved

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
so we know this would be very improved
camera<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> should<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> better

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
camera and should be one of the better

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.750 
camera and should be one of the better
cameras<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.320> i<00:01:10.530> would<00:01:10.680> say<00:01:10.890> matching

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
cameras or actually i would say matching

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.070 
cameras or actually i would say matching
the<00:01:11.880> best<00:01:12.119> camera<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> android

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the best camera on the android

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.109 
the best camera on the android
smartphone<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.340> i<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.790> were<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
smartphone so i think they were going to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.190 
smartphone so i think they were going to
see<00:01:15.270> some<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.659> cool<00:01:15.900> improvements

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
see some really cool improvements

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
see some really cool improvements
especially<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.979> Samsung<00:01:17.369> making<00:01:17.970> headway

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
especially with Samsung making headway

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.390 
especially with Samsung making headway
with<00:01:18.600> their<00:01:18.840> stat<00:01:19.409> alone<00:01:19.710> cameras<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
with their stat alone cameras like the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.990 
with their stat alone cameras like the
NX<00:01:20.729> 30<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.150> then<00:01:21.270> x1<00:01:21.860> also<00:01:22.860> performance<00:01:23.850> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
NX 30 and then x1 also performance in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.020 
NX 30 and then x1 also performance in
terms<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.479> actually<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> processor<00:01:26.030> we've

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
terms of actually the processor we've

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.120 
terms of actually the processor we've
heard<00:01:27.299> where<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> samsung<00:01:28.290> might<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
heard where the samsung might be good in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620 
heard where the samsung might be good in
an<00:01:29.220> Exynos<00:01:29.670> processor<00:01:29.700> folder<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.600> is

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
an Exynos processor folder which is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
an Exynos processor folder which is
actually<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.110> in-house<00:01:31.759> processor<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.119> all

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
actually the in-house processor for all

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.200 
actually the in-house processor for all
the<00:01:33.799> galaxy<00:01:34.799> s<00:01:34.890> devices<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.640> six<00:01:35.909> devices

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the galaxy s devices as six devices

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
the galaxy s devices as six devices
worldwide<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.860> separated

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
worldwide so it's not gonna be separated

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.740 
worldwide so it's not gonna be separated
between<00:01:38.460> korea<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> rest<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> world

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
between korea and the rest of the world

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
between korea and the rest of the world
and<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> latest

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and from what we know from the latest

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.210 
and from what we know from the latest
Exynos<00:01:42.780> processor<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> 14

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Exynos processor it's that is a 14

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
Exynos processor it's that is a 14
nanometer<00:01:44.340> chip<00:01:44.970> which<00:01:45.450> means<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.930> should

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
nanometer chip which means you should

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.190 
nanometer chip which means you should
get<00:01:46.259> faster<00:01:46.740> performance<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:48.049> will<00:01:49.049> be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
get faster performance and also will be

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
get faster performance and also will be
able<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.860> cooler<00:01:50.670> temperatures<00:01:51.270> so

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
able to get cooler temperatures so

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
able to get cooler temperatures so
basically<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> smaller

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
basically you can have it in a smaller

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.060 
basically you can have it in a smaller
case<00:01:53.700> frame<00:01:54.170> altogether<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> very

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
case frame altogether which is very

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
case frame altogether which is very
important<00:01:56.610> as<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.030> things<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.509> second

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
important as the things of my second

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.179 
important as the things of my second
point<00:01:58.469> number<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.490> design<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> galaxy<00:02:01.770> s6

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
point number two design so the galaxy s6

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.490 
point number two design so the galaxy s6
is<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:02.969> redesigned<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> mentioned

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
is going to be redesigned as I mentioned

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.130 
is going to be redesigned as I mentioned
also<00:02:04.649> having<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.460> math<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.390> smaller

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
also having that's math you know smaller

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
also having that's math you know smaller
die<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.829> pro<00:02:08.220> processor<00:02:08.520> which<00:02:08.970> means<00:02:09.270> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
die of a pro processor which means you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.040 
die of a pro processor which means you
can<00:02:09.539> actually<00:02:09.690> fit

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
can actually fit

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.560 
can actually fit
smaller<00:02:10.650> of<00:02:10.830> course<00:02:11.040> space<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> we've<00:02:12.300> heard

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
smaller of course space and we've heard

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.540 
smaller of course space and we've heard
word<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> galaxy<00:02:13.590> s6<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.130> be<00:02:14.250> six

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
word that the galaxy s6 will be six

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.490 
word that the galaxy s6 will be six
point<00:02:14.820> nine<00:02:14.880> millimeters<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:15.720> also<00:02:15.900> Samsung

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
point nine millimeters but also Samsung

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.370 
point nine millimeters but also Samsung
turn<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.160> out<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.760> image<00:02:18.210> which<00:02:19.020> basically

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
turn it out this image which basically

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.260 
turn it out this image which basically
kind<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.860> points<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> very<00:02:20.580> thinner<00:02:20.910> frame

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
kind of points to a very thinner frame

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.420 
kind of points to a very thinner frame
we<00:02:21.570> also<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.170> they're<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
we also know that they're going to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.160 
we also know that they're going to
continue<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.970> design<00:02:24.270> language<00:02:24.510> started

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
continue the design language started

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.560 
continue the design language started
from<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.100> Galaxy<00:02:26.550> Note<00:02:26.580> 4<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.120> alpha

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
from the Galaxy Note 4 on the alpha

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.690 
from the Galaxy Note 4 on the alpha
which<00:02:27.750> had<00:02:27.960> metal<00:02:28.560> into<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
which had metal into it so what is that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.110 
which had metal into it so what is that
we'll<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.150> an<00:02:30.480> all<00:02:31.200> metal<00:02:31.550> design<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.060> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
we'll have an all metal design on this a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.900 
we'll have an all metal design on this a
mostly<00:02:34.020> metal<00:02:34.260> phone<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.890> also<00:02:35.400> we've<00:02:35.610> also

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
mostly metal phone and also we've also

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.110 
mostly metal phone and also we've also
got<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.600> new<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.560> eat<00:02:37.710> as<00:02:37.890> well<00:02:38.400> adding<00:02:38.790> video

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
got this new to eat as well adding video

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.560 
got this new to eat as well adding video
showcasing<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:41.010> will<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.570> borderless

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
showcasing that it will be borderless

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.720 
showcasing that it will be borderless
and<00:02:42.810> also<00:02:43.170> metal<00:02:43.560> included<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.250> can

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
and also metal included so you can

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.730 
and also metal included so you can
expect<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> see<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.480> really<00:02:45.960> fresh<00:02:46.290> new<00:02:46.560> design

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
expect to see in really fresh new design

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.010 
expect to see in really fresh new design
for<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.610> s6<00:02:48.060> even<00:02:48.300> though<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.660> case

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
for the s6 even though we have case

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.650 
for the s6 even though we have case
cases<00:02:49.980> where<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.520> case<00:02:50.760> fit<00:02:51.180> doesn't

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
cases where the case fit doesn't

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.180 
cases where the case fit doesn't
actually<00:02:51.840> tell<00:02:52.050> us<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> design<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
actually tell us what the design of the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.770 
actually tell us what the design of the
phone<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.360> would<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.480> very

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
phone is so that would be very

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.040 
phone is so that would be very
interesting<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> take<00:02:55.860> note<00:02:56.130> number<00:02:57.050> three

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
interesting to take note number three

invest more into mobile payments and we

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.690 
invest more into mobile payments and we
know<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.740> big<00:03:04.770> thing<00:03:04.920> applique<00:03:05.580> is

know that's a big thing applique is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.640 
know that's a big thing applique is
taken<00:03:06.000> up<00:03:06.090> fairly<00:03:06.390> well<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.930> Apple<00:03:07.470> pay<00:03:07.590> is

I<00:03:14.850> think<00:03:15.300> will<00:03:15.570> be<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.720> different<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.709> of

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
I think will be really different one of

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.470 
I think will be really different one of
your<00:03:17.040> because<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.459> two<00:03:17.670> things<00:03:17.700> one<00:03:18.180> samsung

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
your because of two things one samsung

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.690 
your because of two things one samsung
is<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> upgrade<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.220> fingerprint

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
is going to upgrade the fingerprint

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.970 
is going to upgrade the fingerprint
sensor<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.510> actually<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.830> actually

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
sensor to actually have to actually

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.420 
sensor to actually have to actually
allow<00:03:23.610> for<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> larger<00:03:24.959> fingerprint<00:03:25.860> reader<00:03:26.160> so

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
allow for a larger fingerprint reader so

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.610 
allow for a larger fingerprint reader so
you<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.060> press<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.630> not<00:03:27.870> swipe<00:03:28.200> similar

you have to press and not swipe similar

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.290 
you have to press and not swipe similar
to<00:03:28.680> what<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.700> your<00:03:29.850> iPhone

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300

that<00:05:19.550> Microsoft<00:05:20.150> applications<00:05:20.720> will<00:05:21.020> be

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
that Microsoft applications will be

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.800 
that Microsoft applications will be
coming<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.740> Samsung<00:05:22.669> devices<00:05:23.000> this<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:23.750> of

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
coming to Samsung devices this is of

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.990 
coming to Samsung devices this is of
course<00:05:23.870> because<00:05:24.260> of<00:05:24.289> Microsoft<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.070> Samsung

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
course because of Microsoft and Samsung

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.490 
course because of Microsoft and Samsung
commission<00:05:26.419> agreement<00:05:26.660> over<00:05:27.139> their<00:05:27.289> little

commission agreement over their little

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.650 
commission agreement over their little
spat<00:05:27.889> they<00:05:28.099> had<00:05:28.280> over<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:28.940> last<00:05:29.000> six<00:05:29.539> months

spat they had over the last six months

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.540 
spat they had over the last six months
which<00:05:30.470> what<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:30.949> means<00:05:31.190> is<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.370> you're

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
which what that means is that you're

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.839 
which what that means is that you're
going<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.940> get<00:05:32.210> office<00:05:32.810> apps<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.500> our<00:05:33.979> galaxy

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
going to get office apps on our galaxy

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.610 
going to get office apps on our galaxy
s6<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.449> you're<00:05:35.810> also<00:05:35.990> going<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.229> get<00:05:36.349> one

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
s6 and you're also going to get one

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.260 
s6 and you're also going to get one
drive<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.190> I<00:05:37.280> won't<00:05:37.520> be<00:05:37.580> surprised<00:05:38.060> at

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
drive and I won't be surprised at

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.300 
drive and I won't be surprised at
Microsoft<00:05:38.750> we<00:05:38.870> bundled<00:05:39.380> probably<00:05:39.860> 100

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
Microsoft we bundled probably 100

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.610 
Microsoft we bundled probably 100
gigabytes<00:05:40.729> on<00:05:40.880> onedrive<00:05:41.300> for<00:05:42.020> a<00:05:42.080> year<00:05:42.349> with

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
gigabytes on onedrive for a year with

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.529 
gigabytes on onedrive for a year with
your<00:05:42.770> Galaxy<00:05:43.220> s6<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:43.760> that's<00:05:43.909> something<00:05:44.180> that

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
your Galaxy s6 so that's something that

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.110 
your Galaxy s6 so that's something that
I<00:05:45.289> think<00:05:45.590> very<00:05:45.889> refreshing<00:05:46.310> because<00:05:46.729> we<00:05:47.000> all

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
I think very refreshing because we all

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.520 
I think very refreshing because we all
know<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.330> office<00:05:47.780> apps<00:05:47.990> actually<00:05:48.199> been

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
know that office apps actually been

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.200 
know that office apps actually been
working<00:05:48.800> pretty<00:05:48.889> well<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:49.340> onedrive<00:05:50.000> does

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
working pretty well and onedrive does

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.080 
working pretty well and onedrive does
actually<00:05:50.389> has<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:51.020> very<00:05:51.409> good<00:05:52.090> reliability

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
actually has a very good reliability

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.529 
actually has a very good reliability
function<00:05:53.720> so<00:05:54.460> with<00:05:55.460> that<00:05:55.729> in<00:05:56.000> mind<00:05:56.030> I<00:05:56.479> think

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
function so with that in mind I think

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.800 
function so with that in mind I think
we're<00:05:56.810> going<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.020> see<00:05:57.050> Microsoft<00:05:57.800> apps<00:05:58.010> are

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
we're going to see Microsoft apps are

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.110 
we're going to see Microsoft apps are
pre-installed<00:05:59.810> on<00:06:00.260> your<00:06:00.500> Galaxy<00:06:00.949> s6<00:06:01.250> and

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
pre-installed on your Galaxy s6 and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.800 
pre-installed on your Galaxy s6 and
finally<00:06:02.599> number<00:06:02.630> 6<00:06:04.090> battery<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.389> wireless

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
finally number 6 battery and wireless

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.230 
finally number 6 battery and wireless
charging<00:06:06.139> now<00:06:06.949> because<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.520> device<00:06:07.820> is<00:06:08.030> going

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
charging now because the device is going

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.360 
charging now because the device is going
to<00:06:08.300> be<00:06:08.360> thinner<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:09.050> slimmer<00:06:09.710> we<00:06:10.159> might

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
to be thinner and slimmer we might

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.339 
to be thinner and slimmer we might
actually<00:06:10.550> have<00:06:10.760> a<00:06:11.030> slightly<00:06:11.449> smaller<00:06:11.750> battery

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
actually have a slightly smaller battery

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.050 
actually have a slightly smaller battery
a<00:06:12.560> lot<00:06:13.010> of<00:06:13.099> the<00:06:13.159> rumblings<00:06:13.550> are<00:06:13.760> saying<00:06:13.970> the

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
a lot of the rumblings are saying the

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.060 
a lot of the rumblings are saying the
battery<00:06:14.419> might<00:06:14.630> be<00:06:14.780> slightly<00:06:15.020> smaller<00:06:15.470> and

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
battery might be slightly smaller and

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.890 
battery might be slightly smaller and
also<00:06:16.280> we<00:06:16.460> will<00:06:16.670> not<00:06:16.850> be<00:06:16.910> able<00:06:17.060> to<00:06:17.330> swap<00:06:17.630> out<00:06:17.780> our

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
also we will not be able to swap out our

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.170 
also we will not be able to swap out our
batteries<00:06:18.260> which<00:06:18.440> would<00:06:18.590> be<00:06:18.770> very<00:06:19.130> big<00:06:19.760> change

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
batteries which would be very big change

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.470 
batteries which would be very big change
for<00:06:20.780> most<00:06:21.140> samsung<00:06:22.070> users<00:06:22.430> starting<00:06:23.270> from<00:06:23.390> the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
for most samsung users starting from the

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.990 
for most samsung users starting from the
original<00:06:23.990> galaxy<00:06:24.470> line<00:06:24.860> all<00:06:25.160> the<00:06:25.220> way<00:06:25.670> to<00:06:25.820> the

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
original galaxy line all the way to the

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.850 
original galaxy line all the way to the
galaxy<00:06:26.390> s5<00:06:26.780> you're<00:06:27.050> able<00:06:27.290> to<00:06:27.380> swap<00:06:27.620> out<00:06:27.710> the

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
galaxy s5 you're able to swap out the

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.560 
galaxy s5 you're able to swap out the
battery<00:06:28.190> but<00:06:28.640> because<00:06:29.120> of<00:06:29.150> someone's

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
battery but because of someone's

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.120 
battery but because of someone's
different<00:06:30.080> design<00:06:30.380> changes<00:06:30.770> i've<00:06:30.920> mentioned

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
different design changes i've mentioned

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.340 
different design changes i've mentioned
i<00:06:31.580> think<00:06:32.120> that<00:06:32.300> won't<00:06:32.450> be<00:06:32.540> the<00:06:32.600> case<00:06:32.690> which

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
i think that won't be the case which

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.690 
i think that won't be the case which
brings<00:06:33.680> us<00:06:33.800> to<00:06:33.830> two<00:06:34.100> things<00:06:34.310> so<00:06:34.550> you're

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
brings us to two things so you're

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.820 
brings us to two things so you're
probably<00:06:34.930> samsung<00:06:35.930> is<00:06:36.110> definitely<00:06:36.620> going<00:06:36.740> to

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
probably samsung is definitely going to

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.830 
probably samsung is definitely going to
continue<00:06:37.100> with<00:06:37.400> its<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.760> quick<00:06:38.000> charge<00:06:38.330> of<00:06:38.660> the

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
continue with its a quick charge of the

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.660 
continue with its a quick charge of the
Qualcomm<00:06:39.260> quick<00:06:39.290> charge<00:06:39.500> or<00:06:40.220> at<00:06:40.310> least<00:06:40.520> that

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
Qualcomm quick charge or at least that

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.420 
Qualcomm quick charge or at least that
quick<00:06:40.940> charge<00:06:41.180> technology<00:06:42.310> even<00:06:43.310> the

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
quick charge technology even the

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.670 
quick charge technology even the
original<00:06:43.940> Qualcomm<00:06:44.300> ship<00:06:44.540> so<00:06:45.200> that<00:06:45.230> gives<00:06:45.560> you

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
original Qualcomm ship so that gives you

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.890 
original Qualcomm ship so that gives you
ability<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:46.190> charge<00:06:46.820> your<00:06:46.910> device<00:06:47.210> in<00:06:47.450> under

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
ability to charge your device in under

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.960 
ability to charge your device in under
10<00:06:48.800> minutes<00:06:48.830> to<00:06:49.190> talk<00:06:49.340> to<00:06:49.520> about<00:06:49.580> fifty

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
10 minutes to talk to about fifty

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.450 
10 minutes to talk to about fifty
percent<00:06:50.000> so<00:06:50.720> you<00:06:50.780> can<00:06:50.990> have<00:06:51.200> it<00:06:51.380> your<00:06:52.010> w<00:06:52.340> rice

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
percent so you can have it your w rice

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.670 
percent so you can have it your w rice
running<00:06:52.820> constantly<00:06:53.330> for<00:06:53.900> you<00:06:54.080> and<00:06:54.290> also

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
running constantly for you and also

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.380 
running constantly for you and also
we're<00:06:55.010> going<00:06:55.160> to<00:06:55.220> see<00:06:55.400> wireless<00:06:55.850> charging<00:06:56.270> I

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
we're going to see wireless charging I

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.580 
we're going to see wireless charging I
think<00:06:56.600> this<00:06:56.690> is<00:06:56.810> the<00:06:56.930> first<00:06:57.170> time<00:06:57.290> we'll<00:06:57.470> see

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
think this is the first time we'll see

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.320 
think this is the first time we'll see
wireless<00:06:57.860> charging<00:06:58.130> built-in<00:06:58.670> without<00:06:59.300> a

wireless charging back cover unit are in

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.950
