00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.300
 as far as our contribution on the 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:14.360
 Germany-wide 24 hours lightning 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.480
 marathon and now we switch to 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.390
 our outdoor reporter torben eckermann 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.609
 please tell us is currently 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.590
 Hello Friedrich I am here in 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.240
 greven in the beautiful Munsterland on a 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.730
 farm of a very special 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.140
 modern production way has interesting 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.180
 what makes this farm so 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.129
 modern have many agricultural 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.989
 Companies today rely on bio 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.820
 products without the exploitation of 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.030
 Cows are producing pigs and chickens 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.750
 here in greven will be a step 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.150
 thought further 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.519
 pig is pig in front of me is the 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.949
 owner of this farm hello pig 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.870
 They used to be part of the company for a long time 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.670
 In the food chain you have one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.590
 own farm away have them 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.850
 idea for this novel concept and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.289
 Do you think that will make you more 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 People can do it 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.079
 vegetarian or vegan lifestyle in 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.079
 to consider 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.490
 They misunderstand me, I think 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.869
 her concept is great as 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.610
 journalist interest me but 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.380
 of course, the backgrounds they have 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 on it and the traditional norms too 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.649
 break and something completely new 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.910
 like an animal-led 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.600
 agricultural operation on the 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.600
 to put legs 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.640
 so I apparently have them on the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.320
 wrong foot caught why I start 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.399
 again from the beginning on her 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.399
 revolutionary concept 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 such an oxer why can this cool 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:59.400
 So say yes to this attitude 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.930
 will probably continue to be the least 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
 people on meat want to do without 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.000
 I do not know why that will change 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.000
 should
