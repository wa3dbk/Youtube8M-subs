00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.920
 all we present today is the slip 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.590
 b121 product by asus is a tablet abacus 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 which in reality hides a soul 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.980
 far more complete and more versatile than a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.890
 pad to which we are used 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.720
 traditionally think and a pub that 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.939
 actually hide a 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.329
 in fact there is a platform inside 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.300
 intel has a processor run to the files of 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.410
 in addition to the already low voltage 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.660
 with 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.540
 we say standard equipment compared to a 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.870
 mid-level notebook 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.790
 the peculiarity of this product is 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.640
 include within a thickness of 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.530
 home the chassis also so thin so 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.800
 light we are around a kilo 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.540
 of weight a screen that integrates the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.330
 precision wacom technology 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.920
 wako technology but means is synonymous 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.600
 high performance point 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.940
 performance similar to tablets 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.619
 this type of professional graphics 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.600
 lets say various scenarios of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.430
 use for this product 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.170
 first let's say the advantage of 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.710
 compatibility on a windows environment 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.530
 seven so compatible with the world 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.660
 other traditional business precisely 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.310
 the flexibility of use and use 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.380
 from the various solutions as well 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.680
 we propose different scenarios 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 today the first one you see directly 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.210
 the potential in the graphic field due 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.450
 to the precision wired technology in one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.780
 demo and directly from that water 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.830
 director of the word 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 our partner graffiti domain 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.100
 it was a very product 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 very effective sensitive is able to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.979
 give me support 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.930
 in addition to the work clearly that me 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.060
 I professively profess core tablets 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.159
 wacom continue to have quality 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.229
 wacom also in a manner 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.229
 real beaches and reds 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.979
 is serene professionally 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.409
 in fact you understand 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.409
 the senses situation can find 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.480
 in Italy 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.480
 fire 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.950
 the precision I can have only mine 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.610
 workstations 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.610
 at the level 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.300
 the problem of 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.430
 without public with the advantage also of 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.920
 to be able to capture written ideas 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.190
 even when you're my movement 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.190
 what's this 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.890
 fact that it is 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.770
 very sensitive in terms of perception 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.720
 5 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.920
 in the profession in my production 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.360
 very important to have one 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.830
 passion 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.900
 because I have to go to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.760
 then do this with this one 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.250
 technology applied on this support 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.770
 allows to give the right traits of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.990
 thickness 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.140
 with the various pressures that they are 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.500
 the feeling of this case 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 all right 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.990
 to be able to give the black white scales of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.580
 gray colors and also with regards to 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.770
 the content of the doctor itself 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.770
 precision can I have 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.620
 from potential 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.620
 the extreme flexibility of the product 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.010
 where of the end of life 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.330
 of the signature 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.720
 this case this partner 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.720
 and paper and I leave you directly 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.020
 we win it 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.569
 how am I putting it all 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.079
 this 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.079
 principle 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.750
 with the assistance of the woman 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.750
 applications that then per hour 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.750
 a decent life so if 2000 and then 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.870
 people 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.520
 transfer 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.240
 contents of that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.240
 do not sign 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.550
 to play 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.900
 because also of a plot 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.470
 being ready windows 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.670
 feels poker can say 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.810
 pensions made 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.289
 every player deserves credit 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.939
 must have the doctor leave to fill out 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.020
 the doctor must sign because he has 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:54.680
 left the samples 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.680
 this Libya 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.670
 I can only immediately say the application 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.030
 I can 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.740
 finally sign with a signature gives 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.350
 at the end of this I can put in 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.460
 all inside my mainframe and then 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.800
 processing without the need to win 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.380
 and this would be impossible with me 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.390
 any bar in con 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.470
 because all the functions 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.750
 the weekend there are six minutes 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.210
 this and substantial then we can do 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.420
 much more example 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.120
 the table but why 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.320
 the doctor who champions but must 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.090
 sign for anyone 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.950
 this kind of other applications 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.720
 they are typical productions 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.720
 I go to make the contract I think 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.420
 the utility with that comes from the fact of 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.390
 be able to record simultaneously 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.770
 also informed 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.230
 compared to the graphic element of the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.150
 sign no that information is 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.270
 exactly what gives a value 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.770
 legal the siena there is the signature in the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.300
 moment why go into detail 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.729
 of the fair 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.220
 the signature when I make a film a 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.380
 holographs on a piece of paper and comes to me 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.030
 disputed 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.630
 substantially the Ligurian territory 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.870
 cunning to mean preparing 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.990
 acceleration speed 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.760
 grows 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.849
 the man fired 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.430
 this dog 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.840
 screen functionality made by juan 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.669
 It allows 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.250
 the coffins with the pen when my son 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.440
 hence this from a value conflict 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.840
 legal at the fair something that would be 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.150
 impossible with other cards that have it 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.669
 capacitive screen type spectrum e 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.970
 therefore they cannot measure the pressure 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.220
 this is basically the advantages of 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.100
 have valid signature software 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.090
 legal only possible 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.090
 the screen 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.190
 the green v shows that it was 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.930
 validated
