I Oh folks is max from Nexus S hacks com
I've<00:00:04.049> got<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.650> review<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.819> nexus<00:00:06.120> bean

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
I've got the review of the nexus bean

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.799 
I've got the review of the nexus bean
ROM<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.519> highly<00:00:08.970> recommend<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.660> is

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
ROM that I highly recommend this is

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.799 
ROM that I highly recommend this is
actually<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.440> best<00:00:10.519> ICS<00:00:11.519> rom<00:00:11.550> for<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.179> regular

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
actually the best ICS rom for a regular

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.220 
actually the best ICS rom for a regular
next<00:00:13.170> success<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.980> tried<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.790> far

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
next success that I have tried so far

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.960 
next success that I have tried so far
first<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.379> all<00:00:16.470> all<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.369> lag<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.940> gone

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
first of all all that like lag is gone

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.240 
first of all all that like lag is gone
on<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.840> your<00:00:19.080> browser<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.800> was<00:00:20.010> just

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
on on your browser which was just

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.210 
on on your browser which was just
annoying<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.240> crap<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.720> me<00:00:21.930> um<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:23.010> as

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
annoying the crap out of me um but as

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.790 
annoying the crap out of me um but as
you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.029> renders<00:00:24.630> fine<00:00:25.019> believe

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you can see it's renders fine believe

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
you can see it's renders fine believe
this<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.310> uses<00:00:26.550> GP<00:00:27.359> rendering<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> that's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this one uses GP rendering and that's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
this one uses GP rendering and that's
probably<00:00:28.289> why<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.279> try<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> combo<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
probably why and I've try to combo it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.139 
probably why and I've try to combo it
with<00:00:30.869> different<00:00:31.590> kernels<00:00:32.279> um<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.820> just

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
with different kernels um it just

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.080 
with different kernels um it just
doesn't<00:00:33.420> work<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:34.460> overclock<00:00:35.460> kernel<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
doesn't work with overclock kernel but

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.590 
doesn't work with overclock kernel but
it<00:00:36.210> works<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.630> well<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.550> stock<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it works really well just stock as it is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.369 
it works really well just stock as it is
it's<00:00:39.899> very<00:00:39.960> zippy<00:00:40.680> face<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.910> LA<00:00:42.379> unfortunately

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it's very zippy face on LA unfortunately

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
it's very zippy face on LA unfortunately
doesn't<00:00:43.620> work<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.460> well<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.000> um<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
doesn't work really well because um I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.680 
doesn't work really well because um I
think<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.050> cries<00:00:46.530> overclocking<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
think that one cries overclocking I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.410 
think that one cries overclocking I
tried<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.989> many<00:00:49.110> different<00:00:49.230> combinations

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
tried so many different combinations

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.580 
tried so many different combinations
otherwise<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.199> good<00:00:52.350> wrong<00:00:53.239> minimal

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
otherwise it's a very good wrong minimal

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
otherwise it's a very good wrong minimal
black<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.890> I've<00:00:55.980> seen<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.460> most<00:00:57.090> from

maybe you guys have any suggestions I've
tried<00:01:31.170> matrix<00:01:31.710> kernel<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.850> could<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.180> be

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
tried matrix kernel and it could just be

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
tried matrix kernel and it could just be
that<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:34.320> nexus<00:01:34.770> s<00:01:34.979> doesn't<00:01:35.340> overclock

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that my my nexus s doesn't overclock

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.569 
that my my nexus s doesn't overclock
that<00:01:36.180> well<00:01:36.360> vs<00:01:36.750> lion<00:01:36.960> exercise<00:01:37.439> 4G<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:37.920> part

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that well vs lion exercise 4G and part

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.690 
that well vs lion exercise 4G and part
of<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.170> chip<00:01:40.409> itself<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of that is you know the chip itself you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
of that is you know the chip itself you
know<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.180> silicones<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:43.079> there's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
know these silicones there there's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
know these silicones there there's
variables<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.360> some<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.320> know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
variables so it's some you know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.990 
variables so it's some you know
depending<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.130> luck<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.640> might<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.939> able

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
depending on your luck you might be able

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420 
depending on your luck you might be able
to<00:01:48.119> overclock<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.899> 1.5<00:01:49.710> gigahertz<00:01:50.070> or

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
to overclock it to 1.5 gigahertz or

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.510 
to overclock it to 1.5 gigahertz or
maybe<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.479> point<00:01:51.659> two<00:01:51.930> gears<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.369> my

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
maybe just one point two gears but on my

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
maybe just one point two gears but on my
neck<00:01:53.729> success<00:01:53.880> even<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.720> gingerbread<00:01:55.110> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
neck success even on gingerbread it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
neck success even on gingerbread it
doesn't<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.130> well<00:01:56.310> even<00:01:56.520> anytime<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
doesn't really do well even anytime I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
doesn't really do well even anytime I
even<00:01:57.600> overclock<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.469> 1.2<00:01:59.130> gigs<00:01:59.369> were

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
even overclock it to like 1.2 gigs were

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.450 
even overclock it to like 1.2 gigs were
you<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.000> 1.1<00:02:00.659> gig<00:02:01.110> herbs<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.280> might<00:02:02.430> be

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
you in 1.1 gig herbs so that might be

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
you in 1.1 gig herbs so that might be
why<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.060> i'll<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> link<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.020> matrix

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
why so i'll have a link to matrix

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.890 
why so i'll have a link to matrix
