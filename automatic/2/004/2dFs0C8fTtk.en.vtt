00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.370 

what<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.040> nature<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.459> science<00:04:15.090> well<00:04:15.990> when

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
what is the nature of science well when

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.810 
what is the nature of science well when
you're<00:04:16.530> asking<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.100> you're<00:04:17.370> basically

you're asking that you're basically

asking what is the nature of nature you
see<00:04:21.239> one<00:04:21.510> goal<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.930> science<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.620> understand

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
see one goal of science is to understand

see one goal of science is to understand
nature<00:04:24.650> understanding<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.800> science<00:04:26.190> means

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
nature understanding and science means

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.700 
nature understanding and science means
relating<00:04:27.090> one<00:04:27.510> natural<00:04:27.930> phenomena<00:04:28.500> to

another and recognizing the causes and
effects<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.770> phenomena<00:04:32.460> thus

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
effects of that phenomena thus

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.720 
effects of that phenomena thus
scientists<00:04:34.050> develop<00:04:34.560> explanations<00:04:35.430> for<00:04:35.610> the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
scientists develop explanations for the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.180 
scientists develop explanations for the
