00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
difference is surprise only and the

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.149 
difference is surprise only and the
price<00:02:23.760> depends<00:02:24.150> only<00:02:24.629> just<00:02:25.290> because<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:25.950> try

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
price depends only just because we try

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.930 
price depends only just because we try
