00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
we left out we marched it just like we

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.990 
we left out we marched it just like we
did<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> dahlias<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:41.129> under<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> good<00:00:41.790> two<00:00:41.969> or

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
did the dahlias it under a good two or
three<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.300> four<00:00:42.420> inches<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.809> mulch<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
three or four inches of mulch and it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.279 
three or four inches of mulch and it
survived<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> winter<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.289> started

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
survived the winter and started

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.319
