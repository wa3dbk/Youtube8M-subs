00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
I'll see that this was taken with the

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.029 
I'll see that this was taken with the
Canon<00:01:28.140> EOS<00:01:29.130> 5d<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> high-end<00:01:31.319> camera<00:01:31.649> with

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
Canon EOS 5d so a high-end camera with

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.770 
Canon EOS 5d so a high-end camera with
changeable<00:01:32.490> lenses<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.420> on

the<00:01:34.619> flash<00:01:34.920> did<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.399> fire<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.509> even<00:01:36.659> see

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the flash did not fire I can even see

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.639 
the flash did not fire I can even see
the<00:01:37.259> aperture<00:01:37.920> value<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:39.330> white<00:01:40.080> balance

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
the aperture value the white balance

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.279 
the aperture value the white balance
setting<00:01:41.069> the<00:01:41.490> focal<00:01:42.030> length<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
setting the focal length so this is a

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.249 
setting the focal length so this is a
high-end<00:01:43.710> camera<00:01:44.130> obviously<00:01:45.050> let's<00:01:46.050> take<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
high-end camera obviously let's take a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.020 
high-end camera obviously let's take a
look<00:01:46.440> at<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> second<00:01:47.069> image<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.550> going<00:01:47.819> to<00:01:47.910> be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
look at the second image I'm going to be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.180 
look at the second image I'm going to be
previewing<00:01:48.629> so<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.379> was<00:01:49.560> taken<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.129> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.479 
numbers starting at 240 but it may go up
from<00:04:07.370> there<00:04:07.549> so<00:04:08.510> when<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.660> type<00:04:08.959> in<00:04:09.200> 300<00:04:09.919> it's

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
from there so when I type in 300 it's

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.039 
from there so when I type in 300 it's
telling<00:04:10.879> me<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.120> best<00:04:11.389> I<00:04:11.599> can<00:04:11.660> get<00:04:11.900> out<00:04:12.019> of

by 3 by 2 so when I hit ok now I've

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.219 
by 3 by 2 so when I hit ok now I've
sized<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.609> appropriately<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.750> place<00:04:20.959> into<00:04:21.200> a

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
program like Adobe InDesign these are

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.920 
program like Adobe InDesign these are
key<00:04:24.380> points<00:04:25.340> when<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.729> comes<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.389> working<00:04:26.750> with

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
key points when it comes to working with

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.560 
key points when it comes to working with
images<00:04:27.500> because<00:04:28.099> Photoshop<00:04:28.430> never<00:04:28.970> shows<00:04:29.300> you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
images because Photoshop never shows you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.150 
images because Photoshop never shows you
the<00:04:30.080> actual<00:04:30.860> size<00:04:31.250> in<00:04:31.639> dimensions<00:04:32.449> in<00:04:32.720> inches

the actual size in dimensions in inches

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.189

now<00:04:34.160> if<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.430> were<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.610> web<00:04:34.970> designer<00:04:35.539> I<00:04:35.810> don't

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
now if I were a web designer I don't

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.580 
now if I were a web designer I don't
need<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:37.130> much<00:04:37.490> data<00:04:37.849> so<00:04:38.180> I'm<00:04:38.960> going<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.440> do<00:04:39.560> a
