00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
developed as necessity because people

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.639 
developed as necessity because people

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.340 
I then remove all the excess skin what's
nice<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.760> procedure<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.480> unlike<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
nice about this procedure is unlike a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.679 
nice about this procedure is unlike a
tummy<00:01:04.680> tuck<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.159> doesn't<00:01:05.700> tighten<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
abdominal muscles and that allows for my

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
abdominal muscles and that allows for my
patients<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.650> back<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.159> normal

activities<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.720> much<00:01:12.960> quicker<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:14.010> patients

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
activities much much quicker my patients

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
activities much much quicker my patients

the<00:01:29.880> other<00:01:30.060> advantage<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> smooth<00:01:31.439> tuck

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the other advantage of the smooth tuck

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.080 
the other advantage of the smooth tuck
is<00:01:33.079> because<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.590> doing<00:01:35.340> any<00:01:35.520> muscle

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
is because I'm not doing any muscle

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
is because I'm not doing any muscle
tightening<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.159> am<00:01:38.159> able<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> preserve<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> lot

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
tightening I am able to preserve a lot

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
tightening I am able to preserve a lot
