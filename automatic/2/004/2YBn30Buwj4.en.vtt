00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
don't recommend it is because there is a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
don't recommend it is because there is a
table<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.119> believe<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.409> use

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
table that I believe that they will use

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
table that I believe that they will use
more<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.000> board<00:01:15.210> exam<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.350> let<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.390> show

so let me show you just so that you see
it<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:21.989> your<00:02:22.080> own<00:02:22.140> peepers<00:02:25.700> alright<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.239> here

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it with your own peepers alright so here

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.809 
it with your own peepers alright so here
it<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.720> printed<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:29.040> manual<00:02:29.519> okay<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.450> so

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
it is printed in the manual okay and so

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.449 
it is printed in the manual okay and so
what<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:32.849> did<00:02:32.970> they<00:02:33.239> just<00:02:33.450> drew<00:02:33.690> some<00:02:33.720> columns

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
what I did they just drew some columns

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.800 
what I did they just drew some columns
okay<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.819> real<00:02:36.000> clear<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.690> we're

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
okay so it's real clear that we're

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.650 
okay so it's real clear that we're
dealing<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.019> three<00:02:37.580> separate<00:02:38.580> pieces<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
dealing with three separate pieces to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
dealing with three separate pieces to
medical<00:02:39.989> decision-making<00:02:40.349> we've<00:02:41.250> got<00:02:41.489> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
medical decision-making we've got the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
medical decision-making we've got the
DMO<00:02:42.060> piece<00:02:42.330> diagnosis<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.470> management

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
DMO piece diagnosis and management

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.390 
DMO piece diagnosis and management
options<00:02:44.340> we've<00:02:44.849> got<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> data<00:02:45.480> piece<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
options we've got the data piece and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.789 
options we've got the data piece and
then<00:02:47.400> we've<00:02:47.519> got<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.880> risk<00:02:48.150> piece<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.620> this

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
then we've got the risk piece so this

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.839 
then we've got the risk piece so this
risk<00:02:50.130> piece<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:51.980> when<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.310> medical<00:02:53.610> when

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
risk piece is when you do medical when

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.819 
risk piece is when you do medical when
you<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.060> auditing<00:02:54.510> chart<00:02:54.810> auditing<00:02:55.230> they<00:02:55.500> use

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
you do auditing chart auditing they use

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.500 
you do auditing chart auditing they use
that<00:02:56.069> table<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.489> risk<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.299> showed

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that table of risk that I just showed

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
that table of risk that I just showed
you<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.019> backs<00:02:58.739> into<00:02:59.190> these<00:02:59.310> levels

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
you and that backs into these levels

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.190 
you and that backs into these levels
that's<00:03:00.480> getting<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.560> enth<00:03:01.950> degree<00:03:02.489> of

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
that's getting to the enth degree of

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.250 
that's getting to the enth degree of
difficulty<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:05.549> my<00:03:06.140> experience<00:03:07.140> that

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
difficulty and it's my experience that

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.990 
difficulty and it's my experience that
they<00:03:07.410> don't<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.640> board<00:03:08.849> exam

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
they don't do that on the board exam

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.770 
they don't do that on the board exam
unless<00:03:09.480> they've<00:03:09.840> recently<00:03:10.140> changed<00:03:11.780> they

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
unless they've recently changed they

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.809 
unless they've recently changed they
they<00:03:13.260> might<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.709> tell<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.459> straight

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
they might not tell you it's straight

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.780 
they might not tell you it's straight
forward<00:03:15.000> low<00:03:15.660> moderate<00:03:16.349> or<00:03:16.530> high<00:03:16.739> which<00:03:17.609> we

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
forward low moderate or high which we

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.000 
forward low moderate or high which we
want<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.389> know<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.900> put<00:03:19.650> into<00:03:19.889> my

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
want to you know do to put into my

want to you know do to put into my
little<00:03:20.190> locate<00:03:20.760> your<00:03:20.850> hem<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.180> time

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
little locate your hem and time

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.000 
little locate your hem and time
technique<00:03:22.350> but<00:03:23.220> they<00:03:23.579> might<00:03:23.819> tell<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.359> it's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
technique but they might tell you it's

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.199 
technique but they might tell you it's
limited<00:03:26.010> DMO<00:03:26.730> its<00:03:27.209> moderate<00:03:27.780> data<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.650> it's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
limited DMO its moderate data and it's

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.509 
limited DMO its moderate data and it's
low-risk<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.660> then<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.739> need<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.950> pull<00:03:32.280> those

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
low-risk and then you need to pull those

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.670 
low-risk and then you need to pull those
pieces<00:03:32.910> together<00:03:33.329> using<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.139> table<00:03:34.380> that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
pieces together using this table that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.890 
pieces together using this table that
already<00:03:35.010> exists<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.519> book<00:03:35.819> so<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.660> table

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
already exists in the book so this table

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.190 
already exists in the book so this table
is<00:03:37.109> saying<00:03:37.380> two<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.920> three<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:39.959> have

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
is saying two of three so you can have

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.309 
is saying two of three so you can have
and<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.470> got<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.859> from<00:03:43.760> four<00:03:44.760> here<00:03:45.230> right<00:03:46.230> in

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
and I got that from four here right in

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.750 
and I got that from four here right in
the<00:03:46.440> guidelines<00:03:46.829> this<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.190> qualify<00:03:47.549> for<00:03:47.609> a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
the guidelines this is to qualify for a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.300 
the guidelines this is to qualify for a
given<00:03:48.000> type<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.299> decision<00:03:48.720> making<00:03:48.870> two<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
given type of decision making two of the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.940 
given type of decision making two of the
three<00:03:50.549> elements<00:03:50.730> must<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.450> met<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:51.900> exceeded

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
three elements must be met or exceeded

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.860 
three elements must be met or exceeded
so<00:03:52.950> if<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.400> had<00:03:53.669> a<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.120> forgot<00:03:54.389> what<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.569> said<00:03:54.599> if

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
so if you had a I forgot what I said if

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.509 
so if you had a I forgot what I said if
you<00:03:54.959> have<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.169> limited<00:03:55.799> moderate<00:03:56.549> low<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:59.340> can

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
you have a limited moderate low you can

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.059 
you have a limited moderate low you can
throw<00:03:59.700> out<00:03:59.849> one<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.120> them<00:04:00.500> but<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.680> limited

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
throw out one of them but the limited

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.319 
throw out one of them but the limited
and<00:04:02.190> low<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.579> bring<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.880> down<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.090> a

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
and low is going to bring you down to a

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.940 
and low is going to bring you down to a
low<00:04:03.630> complexity<00:04:04.730> now<00:04:05.730> if<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:05.940> said<00:04:06.269> limited

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
low complexity now if I said limited

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.670 
low complexity now if I said limited
moderate<00:04:07.950> moderate<00:04:08.810> then<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.989> can<00:04:10.169> throw<00:04:10.500> out

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
moderate moderate then we can throw out

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.220 
moderate moderate then we can throw out
the<00:04:10.859> limited<00:04:11.280> cuz<00:04:11.519> it's<00:04:11.669> two<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.299> three<00:04:12.720> that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
the limited cuz it's two of three that

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.530 
the limited cuz it's two of three that
we<00:04:13.380> need<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.709> meet<00:04:13.889> or<00:04:14.069> exceed<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:15.090> moderate

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
we need to meet or exceed so moderate

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140 
we need to meet or exceed so moderate
moderate<00:04:16.019> it's<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.320> moderate<00:04:16.769> complexity<00:04:17.310> okay

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
moderate it's a moderate complexity okay

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.479 
moderate it's a moderate complexity okay
so<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.959> risk<00:04:19.289> we<00:04:19.889> don't<00:04:20.070> need<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.400> use

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
so for the risk we don't need to use

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.300 
so for the risk we don't need to use
that<00:04:20.549> detailed<00:04:21.120> table<00:04:21.599> we<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.560> just<00:04:22.830> use<00:04:23.039> the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
that detailed table we can just use the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.890 
that detailed table we can just use the
table<00:04:23.640> they<00:04:23.760> give<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.450> cpt<00:04:24.870> manual

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
table they give you in the cpt manual

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.110
