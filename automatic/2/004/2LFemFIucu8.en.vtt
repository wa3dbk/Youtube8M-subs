00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello comrades here edinho fernandes 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.110
 this is the first video of the channel gives 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.750
 technological steps and channel debut 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.800
 let's bring a pretty simple hint something 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.980
 very basic that is how to put force 5 of the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.410
 xbox the year for two players 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.900
 yes it's a basic thing but I admit 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 I had a hard time learning 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.560
 that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.700
 searching on the internet is not the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.430
 single 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 and the worst is on the internet so I do not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 I found a tutorial has explained everything 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 step by step and of this type 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.910
 be myself and enjoy it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.289
 to open the channel takes steps 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.899
 starting at the view you have to connect the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.289
 console once the connected console was 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.320
 thus chronicles the first building that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.660
 and pressing the xbox button is that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 with a video game crazy you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:11.100
 synchronizes it then enters your account 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.189
 of that between and has the list of accounts 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.950
 you go in case here is the account steps 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.640
 this afternoon the Lord steps our way 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.060
 semi official phathar 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.060
 we hope to enter 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.450
 Okay once you enter the first 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.619
 console we will synchronize the second 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.119
 troli our stories have a habit of 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.250
 Speaking of spoken control talk 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.740
 solano the President Lula but let's go 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.549
 let's synchronize the second control 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.679
 Come on, Latina. Come on upstairs. 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.340
 then just get in another account 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.649
 but goose your xbox does not have an account or 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.429
 you do not want to create another account only 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.739
 your friend to play with you 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.869
 we can not be that option here 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:14.380
 down and add invited you 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.440

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.430
 o Important is type each control list 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.010
 in an account we are sure that the same 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.590
 count only the number 1 in parentheses 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.000
 which is just to differentiate synchronized 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:37.060
 controls 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.819
