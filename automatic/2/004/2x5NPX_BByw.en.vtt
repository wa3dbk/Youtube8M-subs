modern jazz line series so what I've

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.200 
modern jazz line series so what I've
decided<00:00:23.810> to<00:00:23.960> do<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:24.350> a<00:00:24.860> combination<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:25.789> a

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
decided to do is a combination of a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.630 
decided to do is a combination of a
10-step<00:00:26.750> process<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.560> learned<00:00:28.190> when<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.460> was

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
10-step process I learned when I was

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.370 
10-step process I learned when I was
studying<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:29.119> music<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.539> Lee<00:00:29.690> Konitz<00:00:29.930> and

studying the music of Lee Konitz and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.720 
studying the music of Lee Konitz and
also<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.730> process<00:00:32.149> of<00:00:32.539> target<00:00:32.989> tone

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
also a process of target tone

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.280 
also a process of target tone
improvising<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:35.420> is<00:00:35.660> often<00:00:35.989> used<00:00:36.140> when

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
improvising that is often used when

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.970 
improvising that is often used when
teaching<00:00:36.500> bebop<00:00:38.110> now<00:00:39.110> let's<00:00:39.290> take<00:00:39.470> a<00:00:39.500> look<00:00:39.770> at

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
teaching bebop now let's take a look at

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.860 
teaching bebop now let's take a look at
the<00:00:40.220> ten<00:00:40.400> steps<00:00:40.700> that<00:00:40.970> I<00:00:41.000> use<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.450> create<00:00:41.660> this

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
the ten steps that I use to create this

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.770 
the ten steps that I use to create this
jazz<00:00:42.140> line<00:00:42.670> we'll<00:00:43.670> start<00:00:43.940> off<00:00:44.060> very<00:00:44.180> simply

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
jazz line we'll start off very simply

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.810 
jazz line we'll start off very simply
and<00:00:45.020> by<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.590> end<00:00:45.800> we<00:00:46.250> should<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.640> a

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
and by the end we should have a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.270 
and by the end we should have a
completely<00:00:47.270> unique<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.809> very<00:00:48.710> interesting

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
completely unique and very interesting

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.850 
completely unique and very interesting
modern<00:00:49.850> jazz<00:00:50.059> line<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.260> we'll<00:00:51.380> start<00:00:51.620> off<00:00:51.710> with

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
modern jazz line so we'll start off with

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.979 
modern jazz line so we'll start off with
our<00:00:51.890> basic<00:00:52.220> voicings<00:00:52.850> for<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.270> one<00:00:53.540> six<00:00:53.809> to

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
our basic voicings for the one six to

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.990 
our basic voicings for the one six to
five<00:00:54.230> progression

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.240 

and<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.260> right<00:01:03.410> hand<00:01:03.620> what<00:01:03.770> I've<00:01:03.860> done<00:01:04.010> is

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
and in the right hand what I've done is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.450 
and in the right hand what I've done is
outline<00:01:05.119> random<00:01:05.840> chord<00:01:06.140> tones<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.770> half

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
outline random chord tones and half

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.609 
outline random chord tones and half
notes<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.030> all<00:01:08.479> these<00:01:08.659> notes<00:01:08.960> will<00:01:09.110> fall<00:01:09.380> on

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
notes and all these notes will fall on

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.469 
notes and all these notes will fall on
the<00:01:09.830> strongest<00:01:10.369> beats<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:10.909> each<00:01:11.030> measures

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
the strongest beats of each measures

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.770 
the strongest beats of each measures
beats<00:01:12.260> one<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:12.770> three<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.550> they<00:01:14.300> will<00:01:14.450> be<00:01:14.600> our

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
beats one and three and they will be our

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.969 
beats one and three and they will be our
guide<00:01:15.050> for<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.740> next<00:01:16.070> five<00:01:16.400> or<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.960> examples

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
guide for the next five or so examples

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.499 
guide for the next five or so examples
so<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.100> notes<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.460> chose<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.060> very<00:01:20.270> first

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
so the notes I chose for the very first

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.020 
so the notes I chose for the very first
example<00:01:20.990> are<00:01:23.710> eleven<00:01:24.710> or<00:01:25.190> fourth<00:01:25.520> depending

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
example are eleven or fourth depending

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:41.899 
example are eleven or fourth depending
on<00:01:26.119> how<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.330> think<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.600> it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.730 

now<00:01:42.909> in<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.150> second<00:01:43.479> example<00:01:43.600> we're<00:01:44.470> going<00:01:44.650> to

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
now in the second example we're going to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.399 
now in the second example we're going to
begin<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.370> outline<00:01:45.940> those<00:01:46.180> core<00:01:46.479> tones<00:01:46.750> using

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
begin to outline those core tones using

00:01:47.409 --> 00:02:01.860 
begin to outline those core tones using
quarter<00:01:47.920> notes

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.210 

now<00:02:02.870> we're<00:02:03.020> going<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.290> outline<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.010> chord

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
now we're going to outline the chord

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.010 
now we're going to outline the chord
tones<00:02:04.460> again<00:02:04.790> but<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.210> time<00:02:05.479> we're<00:02:05.810> going<00:02:05.960> to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
tones again but this time we're going to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:22.230 
tones again but this time we're going to
use<00:02:06.110> eighth<00:02:06.440> notes

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.350 

so<00:02:23.240> up<00:02:23.300> until<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:23.600> we've<00:02:23.810> used<00:02:24.650> entirely

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
so up until now we've used entirely

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.150 
so up until now we've used entirely
diatonic<00:02:26.360> notes<00:02:26.620> we're<00:02:27.620> going<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.890> start<00:02:28.070> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
diatonic notes we're going to start to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.190 
diatonic notes we're going to start to
add<00:02:28.280> some<00:02:28.310> chromaticism<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.930> fourth

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
add some chromaticism and the fourth

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:45.619 
add some chromaticism and the fourth
example

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.360 

in<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.900> fifth<00:02:47.110> example<00:02:47.620> we're<00:02:48.069> going<00:02:48.220> to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
in the fifth example we're going to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:06.030 
in the fifth example we're going to
begin<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.910> displace<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.959> target<00:02:50.319> notes

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.120 

so<00:03:07.040> up<00:03:07.280> until<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:07.790> we've<00:03:08.060> had<00:03:08.090> no<00:03:08.840> rests<00:03:09.350> so

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
so up until now we've had no rests so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.470 
so up until now we've had no rests so
we're<00:03:10.280> going<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.520> start<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.910> add<00:03:11.000> some<00:03:11.030> rest

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
we're going to start to add some rest

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.600 
we're going to start to add some rest
and<00:03:11.840> start<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.410> develop<00:03:12.620> some<00:03:12.980> shapes<00:03:13.280> and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
and start to develop some shapes and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:28.540 
and start to develop some shapes and
some<00:03:14.300> very<00:03:14.750> basic<00:03:15.230> ideas<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.980> line

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.170 

I<00:03:30.250> started<00:03:31.250> really<00:03:31.430> liking<00:03:31.610> some<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.090> those

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
I started really liking some of those

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.110 
I started really liking some of those
shapes<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.780> was<00:03:32.900> doing<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.880> we're<00:03:41.030> gonna

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
shapes that I was doing so we're gonna

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.060 
shapes that I was doing so we're gonna
continue<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.810> develop<00:03:42.050> that<00:03:42.320> idea<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.920> that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
continue to develop that idea in that

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.950 
continue to develop that idea in that
shape<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.610> next<00:03:43.850> line<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.270> example<00:03:44.930> number

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
shape in the next line in example number

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:57.010 
shape in the next line in example number
seven

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.350 

I<00:03:59.710> really<00:04:00.710> like<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.010> end<00:04:01.190> of<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.460> line<00:04:01.670> this

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
I really like the end of that line this

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.500 
I really like the end of that line this
really<00:04:02.930> cool<00:04:03.080> fourth<00:04:03.530> thing<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:04.040> happened

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.550 

so<00:04:11.510> let's<00:04:11.660> see<00:04:11.810> what<00:04:11.930> we<00:04:12.020> can<00:04:12.170> do<00:04:12.320> with<00:04:12.440> that

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
so let's see what we can do with that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.040 
so let's see what we can do with that
interesting<00:04:13.070> idea<00:04:13.370> in<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.060> 8th<00:04:14.390> example

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
interesting idea in the 8th example

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.140 
interesting idea in the 8th example
we're<00:04:15.710> also<00:04:15.860> going<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.400> adding<00:04:16.549> triplets

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
we're also going to be adding triplets

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:32.020 
we're also going to be adding triplets
in<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.450> one<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:31.100> add<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.220> new<00:04:31.520> fourth<00:04:31.850> idea

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
in this one so add that new fourth idea

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.940 
in this one so add that new fourth idea
and<00:04:32.630> I've<00:04:32.750> also<00:04:32.900> got<00:04:33.050> some<00:04:33.230> of<00:04:33.470> those<00:04:33.560> similar

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
and I've also got some of those similar

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:41.159 
and I've also got some of those similar
shapes<00:04:34.250> from<00:04:34.910> previous<00:04:35.390> lines

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.320 

so<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.889> ninth<00:04:42.099> example<00:04:42.610> what<00:04:42.759> I<00:04:42.789> tried<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.210> do

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
so the ninth example what I tried to do

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.360 
so the ninth example what I tried to do
was<00:04:43.569> condense<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.139> melody<00:04:44.469> this<00:04:45.009> will<00:04:45.159> be<00:04:45.249> the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
was condense the melody this will be the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.909 
was condense the melody this will be the
last<00:04:45.520> time<00:04:45.789> we<00:04:45.999> change<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.539> so<00:04:47.499> what<00:04:47.620> I've<00:04:47.710> done

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
last time we change it so what I've done

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.980 
last time we change it so what I've done
is<00:04:47.979> take<00:04:48.430> some<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.639> those<00:04:48.819> shapes<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.479> take

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
is take some of those shapes and take

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.839 
is take some of those shapes and take
some<00:04:50.199> of<00:04:50.289> those<00:04:50.379> rhythms<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.099> try<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.639> make

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
some of those rhythms and try to make

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.760 
some of those rhythms and try to make
something<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.330> was<00:04:52.419> singable<00:04:52.779> and<00:04:53.169> cohesive

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
something that was singable and cohesive

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.649 
something that was singable and cohesive
something<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:54.849> could<00:04:54.999> use<00:04:55.029> within<00:04:55.599> the

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
something that you could use within the

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:09.510 
something that you could use within the
context<00:04:56.169> of<00:04:56.259> a<00:04:56.319> tune<00:04:56.529> so<00:04:57.370> here<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.610> is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.950 

so<00:05:10.520> on<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.700> tenth<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.090> final<00:05:11.120> example<00:05:11.840> what

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
so on the tenth and final example what

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.080 
so on the tenth and final example what
I've<00:05:12.050> done<00:05:12.230> is<00:05:12.590> alter<00:05:13.280> some<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.669> left<00:05:13.880> hand

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
I've done is alter some of the left hand

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.640 
I've done is alter some of the left hand
voicings<00:05:14.540> so<00:05:14.840> they<00:05:14.930> fit<00:05:15.200> better<00:05:15.350> with<00:05:15.440> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
voicings so they fit better with the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.560 
voicings so they fit better with the
melody<00:05:15.980> and<00:05:16.580> also<00:05:16.910> change<00:05:17.180> some<00:05:17.389> of<00:05:17.419> the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
melody and also change some of the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.450 
melody and also change some of the
rhythms<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.650> line<00:05:18.830> becomes<00:05:19.160> a<00:05:19.250> little

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
rhythms so the line becomes a little

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:36.460 
rhythms so the line becomes a little
more<00:05:19.610> cohesive<00:05:20.260> one<00:05:21.260> two<00:05:21.950> three<00:05:22.790> four<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:36.320> can

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
more cohesive one two three four you can

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.530 
more cohesive one two three four you can
find<00:05:36.680> all<00:05:36.950> these<00:05:37.130> lines<00:05:37.460> in<00:05:37.730> the<00:05:38.000> sheet<00:05:38.210> music

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
find all these lines in the sheet music

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.450 
find all these lines in the sheet music
