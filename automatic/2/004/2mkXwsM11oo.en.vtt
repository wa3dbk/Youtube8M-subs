drilled beads these pearls have the

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.979 
drilled beads these pearls have the
holes<00:00:54.220> they're<00:00:54.550> not<00:00:54.760> centered<00:00:55.360> there<00:00:55.600> at<00:00:55.780> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
holes they're not centered there at the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.229 
holes they're not centered there at the
top<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.680> that's<00:00:56.920> what<00:00:57.250> we<00:00:57.399> need<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:57.940> order<00:00:58.090> to

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
top and that's what we need in order to

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.020 
top and that's what we need in order to
make<00:00:58.630> this<00:00:58.960> design<00:00:59.440> so<00:00:59.860> I<00:01:00.399> just<00:01:00.670> pulled<00:01:00.850> out<00:01:00.969> a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
make this design so I just pulled out a

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.580 
make this design so I just pulled out a
few<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.570> I'm<00:01:01.630> going<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.809> try<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.079> find<00:01:02.410> a

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
few and I'm going to try to find a

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.700 
few and I'm going to try to find a
couple<00:01:02.770> that<00:01:03.119> will<00:01:04.119> work<00:01:04.689> together<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.229> sort

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
couple that will work together and sort

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.819 
couple that will work together and sort
of<00:01:05.799> match<00:01:06.009> I'm<00:01:06.820> not<00:01:06.850> real<00:01:07.180> worried<00:01:07.450> about<00:01:07.630> it

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
of match I'm not real worried about it

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.560 
of match I'm not real worried about it
so<00:01:08.829> the<00:01:08.920> first<00:01:09.070> thing<00:01:09.250> we<00:01:09.490> want<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.759> do<00:01:09.939> is<00:01:10.240> pull

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
so the first thing we want to do is pull

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.709 
so the first thing we want to do is pull
out<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.960> length<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.590> wire<00:01:12.430> about<00:01:13.030> eight<00:01:13.329> inches

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
out a length of wire about eight inches

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.609 
out a length of wire about eight inches
long<00:01:14.069> my<00:01:15.069> ruler<00:01:15.340> here<00:01:15.929> it<00:01:16.929> may<00:01:17.079> be<00:01:17.139> a<00:01:17.289> little

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
long my ruler here it may be a little

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.319 
long my ruler here it may be a little
bit<00:01:17.920> more<00:01:18.130> than<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.459> need<00:01:18.670> but<00:01:18.999> it's<00:01:19.119> better

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
bit more than you need but it's better

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.469 
bit more than you need but it's better
to<00:01:19.539> cut<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.959> longer<00:01:20.350> piece<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.039> throw<00:01:21.459> a<00:01:21.880> little

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
to cut a longer piece and throw a little

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.749 
to cut a longer piece and throw a little
bit<00:01:22.630> away<00:01:22.899> then<00:01:23.319> to<00:01:23.469> run<00:01:23.679> short<00:01:24.100> that's<00:01:24.399> just

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
bit away then to run short that's just

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.260 
bit away then to run short that's just
really<00:01:25.329> aggravating<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.029> take<00:01:28.240> your

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
really aggravating so you take your

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.760 
really aggravating so you take your
pearl<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.109> slide<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.429> your<00:01:30.639> wire<00:01:30.880> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
pearl and you slide in your wire and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.980 
pearl and you slide in your wire and
leave<00:01:34.139> about<00:01:35.139> a<00:01:35.170> half<00:01:35.709> an<00:01:35.859> inch<00:01:36.630> sticking<00:01:37.630> out

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
leave about a half an inch sticking out

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.739 
leave about a half an inch sticking out
the<00:01:38.139> other<00:01:38.259> end<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.920> Bend<00:01:42.249> both<00:01:43.240> ends<00:01:43.630> of

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
the other end and then Bend both ends of

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.910 
the other end and then Bend both ends of
the<00:01:43.869> wire<00:01:43.899> up<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.599> then<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.799> one

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
the wire up like that and then the one

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.339 
the wire up like that and then the one
thing<00:01:48.039> I<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.279> about<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.609> 22<00:01:49.299> gauge<00:01:49.599> wire<00:01:49.630> is

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
thing I like about this 22 gauge wire is

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.519 
thing I like about this 22 gauge wire is
I<00:01:50.499> can<00:01:50.709> manipulate<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.310> with<00:01:51.459> my<00:01:51.639> fingers<00:01:52.529> so

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529 
I can manipulate it with my fingers so

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.419 
I can manipulate it with my fingers so
I'm<00:01:53.619> going<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:53.889> bend<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.609> that<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:54.849> makes

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
I'm going to bend it so that it makes

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:04.050 
I'm going to bend it so that it makes
sort<00:01:57.429> of<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.609> triangle<00:01:58.450> above<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.969> pearl<00:02:03.060> if

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
sort of a triangle above the pearl if

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.660 
sort of a triangle above the pearl if
you<00:02:04.179> need<00:02:04.389> to<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:04.959> there<00:02:05.109> with<00:02:05.229> your<00:02:05.380> tools

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.040 

so<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.820> should<00:02:12.000> look<00:02:12.120> something<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.570> that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
so it should look something like that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.380 
so it should look something like that
this<00:02:13.350> isn't<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:14.250> isn't<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.790> show<00:02:15.060> so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this isn't this isn't going to show so

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.730 
this isn't this isn't going to show so
don't<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.260> too<00:02:16.440> worried

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
don't you don't have to be too worried

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.420 
don't you don't have to be too worried
about<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
about that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.270 
about that
now<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.390> shorter<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.040> cut

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
now this shorter one we're going to cut

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.910 
now this shorter one we're going to cut
off<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:21.570> there's<00:02:21.810> only<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:22.170> an<00:02:22.440> eighth<00:02:22.680> of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
off so there's only about an eighth of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.060 
off so there's only about an eighth of
an<00:02:23.040> inch<00:02:23.250> above<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.630> bend<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:28.170> that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.800 

next<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.220> ahead<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.490> grab<00:02:32.790> those<00:02:33.150> two<00:02:33.540> wires

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
next go ahead and grab those two wires

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.620 
next go ahead and grab those two wires
