00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 ah 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.680
 the scars whatever their origin 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.680
 We divide them basically into two types 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.140
 on the one hand those that have a defect of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 substance that would be the scars 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 atrophic and on the other hand those that are 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 with an excess of substance in the dermis 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 which would be hypertrophic or those that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.519
 lloyd is when this one is of a degree 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.430
 superior whether the scars are 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.860
 atrophic as hypertrophic or keloid 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 The main problem lies in the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.540
 quantity and quality of elastin figures 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.010
 and collagen in the dermis by 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.649
 therefore the treatment of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.860
 scars will be destined to improve the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.079
 quality of the dermis of the injury one of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.539
 the most effective treatments and with 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 less adverse effects is the use of 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.259
 non-ablative fractional laser of 1500 40 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.860
 nanometers this laser allows you to act 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.770
 directly on the dermis and or 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.530
 stimulate the synthesis of collagen or 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.720
 get order the elastin fibers 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 and of disorganized collagen in the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960
 hypertrophic scars and those that lloyd 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.450
 is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 we define the scars according to the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.010
 alteration that they present in the dermis 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 when there is a defect in the fibers of 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.820
 collagen and elastin 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.190
 we are talking about atrophic scars 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 that have a loss of substance and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.420
 when there is an excess of fibers of 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 collagen and elastin we talk about a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.580
 hypertrophic scar or from a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 keloid when this reaches the limit 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.920
 excessive the main disorder of the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.399
 scars lies precisely in the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.780
 dermis either because there are fewer fibers or 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.330
 because these are excessive or 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.450
 messed up the treatment so by 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.970
 which will be destined to treat the part 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 deep skin the dermis in the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.080
 Current treatment tools 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 the scars to a great breakthrough that 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.670
 has produced is the possibility of acting 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.700
 directly on the dermis preserving 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.220
 the rest of the skin areas in the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.280
 non-ablative fractional series of 1,500 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.860
 40 nanometers acts specifically on 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.900
 this area either stimulating the synthesis 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.930
 of collagen in atrophic scars 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.659
 or favoring that the fibers of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.629
 and collagen reorder and they talk 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.760
 in the case of hypertrophic scars and 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.969
 keloids through the use of laser 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.459
 non-ablative fractional it is possible that a 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.989
 Throughout the treatment 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.409
 how many sessions that tend to oscillate 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.170
 between 4 x 6 there is a very good improvement 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.810
 meaningful of all the kind of all 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.810
 the types of scars without needing 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.239
 practice aggressive treatments or that 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.530
 modify day- to-day activity 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.530
