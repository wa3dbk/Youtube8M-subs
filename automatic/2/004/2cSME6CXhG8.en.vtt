00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.240
 I do not understand I really do not know if I work with the winter employer Amsterdam 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.909
 on the catwalk project 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.309
 it is the electoral law to deal with we look at responding to a room 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.749
 hope i can 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.640
 I can I can that stimulates 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.430
 today bass dost at five o'clock suck I cherish talpa 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:28.510
 but I think there is a lot of wind but just a joke 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.180
 she also does that with good that the market put they are worth 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.880
 I actually already finished 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.880
 the process continues 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.510
 the part where I am not going anywhere 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.900
 first on talpa 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.200
 it had to record something for the gates of the weather 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.040
 what are you going to do with the speed cameras Thomas I will beck more and more like 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 last season it was mexico when the bus falls 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.850
 but I will now do that again 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.289
 I think treating it just like a surprise should have been her next action 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.320
 6 therefore I do something probably not meticulously ever before 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.920
 backstage short there I am going to do today I had to record something 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 the first things promo things 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.220
 five hours 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.160
 that is not justified but who goes there was they were countered was very 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.210
 cozy utrecht always nice 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.860
 together the netherlands that was fun but regrets her way and now it is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.619
 time to go home again so cycling can be the earliest 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.440
 I can always be online later I have the idea 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.750
 I 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 it's a bit the brunette is getting into the evening every day 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 but that is because my life is getting a bit busier because 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.110
 natural for is and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.290
 it was what is coming 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.120
 so I am all about calculating 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.700

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.540

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.550
 in malaga 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.849
 Jiabao to argue but it did emerge good 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.919
 I say something on the track to shorten shortly on articles that must 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.469
 first what you get 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.469
 if it later seems like they like it 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.699
 I also see myself going there again 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.329

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.339
 the 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.989
 that people have the excretion we think 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.959

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.349
 that's just a sport and fencing that says pots cool 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.760
 chess is a sport 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.189
