00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.390 
people from three totally different
angle

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
angle

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
angle
and<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.300> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.320> there's<00:01:19.650> not

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and that's one thing I think there's not

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
and that's one thing I think there's not
a<00:01:19.830> team<00:01:20.190> in<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.490> league<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.910> have<00:01:21.120> what<00:01:21.330> we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
a team in this league to have what we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.540 
a team in this league to have what we
have<00:01:21.660> it<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.380> shooting<00:01:22.770> guard<00:01:22.980> spot<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
have it at the shooting guard spot I

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.940 
have it at the shooting guard spot I
think<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:23.970> unique<00:01:24.650> some<00:01:25.650> people

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
think that's very unique some people

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310 
think that's very unique some people
look<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> got<00:01:26.730> to<00:01:26.970> choose<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:28.110> one

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
look at it all you got to choose or one

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
look at it all you got to choose or one
or<00:01:28.350> two<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.970> don't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or two of them I don't think I don't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.280

defense<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.330> big<00:02:15.870> thing<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.260> took

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
defense I think a big thing that I took

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.980 
defense I think a big thing that I took
from<00:02:16.709> him<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.100> he<00:02:17.910> didn't<00:02:18.180> gamble<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.690> much<00:02:18.870> as

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
from him is he didn't gamble as much as

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
from him is he didn't gamble as much as
I<00:02:19.110> did<00:02:19.320> he<00:02:19.890> was<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> good<00:02:20.220> defender<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:20.820> he

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
I did he was a good defender but he

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.030 
I did he was a good defender but he
learned<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.600> solid<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.320> his<00:02:22.410> team<00:02:22.680> more

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
learned to be solid for his team more

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.500 
learned to be solid for his team more
than<00:02:23.070> taking<00:02:23.760> Gamble's<00:02:24.180> for<00:02:24.300> his<00:02:24.420> own

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
