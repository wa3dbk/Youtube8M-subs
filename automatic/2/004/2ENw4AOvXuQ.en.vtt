00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.299
 Hello everyone, I did not get in touch 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.760
 This was due to the fact that you can say 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.860
 I played in a cartoon and was busy 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.840
 building this base but now the base 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.100
 I have already built another project 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.450
 and today I decided to make a video about all 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.230
 pistols that can be found in this 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.180
 the game will start with a magnum revolver is rare 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.790
 and a revolver by the way here so here it is 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.620
 looks like i think everyone saw it 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.330
 rare revolver which can be found in 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.110
 civilian buildings and military 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.989
 bases 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.530
 he uses a winchester clip with six 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.390
 charges 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 Obama can be replenished with the most simple 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.399
 civilian patrons who are 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.019
 absolutely everywhere 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.559
 what is a feature of this 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.859
 revolver he is the most powerful ie his 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.109
 damage is 65 percent it means 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.579
 that ordinary zombies and civilians can 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.670
 kill one shot in the head for 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 the military will need two shots also 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.460
 he weighs only 0.7 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.560
 kilograms advantage body makes 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.840
 worn for heavy damage from a shot 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.330
 enough to kill civilian zombies 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.850
 with one shot to the head also 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.380
 winchester clip requires only one 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 cell civilian ammunition for 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.460
 doing also a little weight makes 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.130
 his easiest to put in the game 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.110
 as I said earlier from the flaws as well as 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.210
 all the guns in the game magnum possess 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.480
 slow pace of shooting that is impossible 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.380
 using tactical modifications though in 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.500
 principle 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.790
 You can wear it to fit 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.680
 absolutely everything but 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.420
 there is no practical meaning 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.300
 no because even the muffler 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.600
 jamming is not entirely correct, you can 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.710
 say well, it makes no sense 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.050
 attach different sights and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.250
 because it is a melee weapon 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.170
 but it hits for sure also has the most 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.900
 short shooting range exactly 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
 half from colt or beret and has 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.920
 bright color that makes it noticeable if 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 you play against other users and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.960
 shoots very loud well by the way not 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.380
 louder than a deserted falcon or digle or 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.070
 10 falcon as it is called here what is 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 the next culprit is desert falcon 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.330
 it is the second most powerful gun in the game 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.780
 for charging use swift store and 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.790
 the most common civilian ammunition 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.160
 do 50 percent damage and weighs 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.620
 one and a half kilograms can be attributed to 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.510
 advantages of the company can 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.270
 include a high damage radius and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.430
 great damage for both the gun but also 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.040
 there are drawbacks quite loud 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.650
 shot and rather rare pistol on 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.560
 the fact that you find it in 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.989
 principle can be in all locations locations in 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.280
 which there are police officers that is 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.340
 this is either a ship moorings an abortion they 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.650
 either the confederation bridge or others 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.440
 cities where there are medical departments 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.170
 or on military bases in principle to 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.450
 it also has all the modifications 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.700
 tactical but practical sense from 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.370
 they are no 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.700
 what 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.310
 the third gun I chose beret and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.840
 takes and this is the rarest variety 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.030
 pistol main seat and and slept on 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.090
 this police stations and military bases 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.739
 use the label shop at 13 patronum 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.900
 by the way this is the biggest store 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.470
 of all and replenished with the most ordinary 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.269
 civilian patrons advantage damage 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.299
 more than a colt colleague 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.940
 which will be later but still worse than that 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.950
 desert falcon big store 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.450
 this is really an advantage to the wallpaper 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.700
 just one pack 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.129
 civilian ammo is also light weight 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.799
 high damage radius compared to 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.230
 other pistols but also a lot 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.890
 disadvantages compared to the colt pace 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.590
 firing 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.349
 leaves much to be desired is hard to find and 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.450
 there are also almost no shops 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.640
 meet but 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.470
 Benefits include gadgets 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.609
 because really gadgets for 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.640
 this gun 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.829
 very important you can put on it 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.720
 red dot sight ie red sight 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.720
 point or holographic sight 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.850
 and also very well suited to him 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.170
 silencer and light overwhelming nozzle 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.740
 what can be said about baron 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.900
 damage by 30 percent and bleeding 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.850
 100 meters distance provided 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.500
 rate of fire two hundred minute shots 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.430
 that is, he and the fastest 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.450
 the gun of all and the very last 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.450
 this is colt 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.530
 the colt has a shop for seven rounds then 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.980
 There is basically nothing special 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.800
 but this is one of the most common 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.570
 in the game types of firearms for 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.320
 Charging use light not georgian and 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.350
 the most ordinary civilian ammunition 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.760
 prevalence advantage and 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.220
 used by common stores 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.620
 and ammo but unfortunately flaws 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.170
 more small amount of ammo 7 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.610
 useless on 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.740
 the later stages of the game that is when 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.560
 user and relatively pumped 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.390
 because it is the weakest of 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.400
 pistols and also inflicts a small 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.100
 damage 3 shots civil and two in 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.410
 head or same 5 shots of a military zombie 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.420
 and 3 in the head but you must agree 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.550
 now well they said 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.940
 let's take turns shooting now 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.850
 here are just a lot of zombies let's 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.200
 probably dressed 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:38.030
 PNV to make it easier to notice the zombies and 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.640
 let's go shoot we'll shoot by 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.570
 the queues of all the guns well what's the first 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:48.620
 zombies for him we needed as 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.990
 said two shots but 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.050
 civilian for civilian needed 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.300
 just one experience switch to 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.300
 other desert eagle 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.730
 agree it is really very and 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.730
 very loud 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.550
 but we carried 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.760
 multiple probes 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.820
 Well now let's use our 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.310
 beretta 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:26.710
 much quieter but as you can see 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:30.010
 spend a lot more ammo and they 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.870
 by the way end quickly and by the 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.870
 the last we left was just a ring 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.130
 he is much louder and confused by him 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.130
 as you can see, that's why we take the most 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.720
 ordinary ahaha well, let's start hacking 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.300
 our detractors 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.550
 Well and on this principle in the video 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.270
 review ends next time i 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.919
 tell you about auto and floors 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.169
 automatic rifles 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.500
 well all the best and until next 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.500
 review
