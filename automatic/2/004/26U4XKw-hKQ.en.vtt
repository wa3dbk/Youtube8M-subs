00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello how about how welcome are you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.279
 first on what we look at today in the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.919
 program is something that is beginning to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.160
 extend the big brands begin 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.110
 to bet strong and attention because 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.929
 the solid foundations begin to tremble 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.359
 and the principles of running is about 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.150
 run with shoes without cushioning 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.550
 to feel the asphalt to imitate what 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.220
 some say is the natural way of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.740
 run from the human being the last step in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 this whole process running barefoot 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.369
 radiography today on planet sprint the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.369
 natural running 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.399
 is beginning to rethink many 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.649
 principles of the run in some defend 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.409
 which is the normal and natural way of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.570
 run others go further and believe that it is 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.039
 the way to end injuries like 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 that does not have a scientific demonstration 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.110
 total or absolute so far 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 in theory, what I think is that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.170
 you also have to see it from a point of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.670
 sight a little romantic then not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 so practical there is nothing 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.659
 damping motivation is 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 self motivation pgje is worth that because 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.310
 look for a certain way to fuck 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.910
 avoiding entering heel and good as 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.420
 when everything with the foot the heel hits 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.280
 suffers the impact towards the knee of the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 knee to pass the hip and hip 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.619
 it comes to nervous information that is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.920
 to the lumbar people who normally 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.890
 has runner problems they have for 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.500
 the iliotibial band come dice of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.260
 that excessive impact are increasingly more 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 the adepts to the natural running feel the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.880
 ground use footwear without 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.979
 cushioning or directly running 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.649
 barefoot we are historically 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.030
 prepared to step barefoot I have 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.509
 seen in any one population that goes 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.420
 barefoot belt problems 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.979
 iliotibial eyeos valgus problems what 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.020
 that is the foot bunion that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.030
 goes within our genes we do not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.080
 we do knowing how to run correctly and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.239
 the proof is that you put 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 any child running a sneaker 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.650
 flat and runs great and without 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.810
 But then we put on a sneaker 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.549
 that protects us and what we do is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.110
 tell the foot what we do are from 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.790
 sneakers 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.640
 they have 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 but difference let's say the 0 drop 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.110
 very little difference between the part of 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.160
 the entrance part of the back 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.600
 I hope you forced us to run from 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.690
 certain form 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.390
 it would be the closest thing to the barefoot backwards 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.910
 The main and only difference is that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.830
 with the traditionally traditional running 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.350
 that we call traditional that only exists 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.150
 since the 70s is that we have a 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.600
 little bit more because because the shoes 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.450
 give us the convenience of doing the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.270
 problem is in the structure when 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.000
 we step with the heel at functional level 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.850
 from the pelvis they are produced 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 an imbalance because we are not 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.239
 ready to step with the heel 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 we will have to unlearn what we have 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.180
 We learned when we've been a 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.920
 slippers and we have started to run badly 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.019
 and try again to learn and there 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.420
 who has seen substantial improvements 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.040
 in the marks of one year for another one 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.050
 difference of about five minutes in a 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.760
 10k for example because so 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.020
 I was commenting earlier on to eliminate the pressure and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.210
 negative all 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.130
 forward what the newton has is 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.870
 this protruding in the metatarsal that in 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.820
 theory what they force you is to tread with 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.440
 you know that the cushioning is 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.330
 concentrated in the front not in 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.520
 the back had heard about 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.930
 this shoe that is the mer the trail and 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.820
 Well, the truth is that a sneaker 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.590
 I highly recommend the sales of these 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.660
 sneakers are growing so 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.480
 important it is clear that it has been 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.220
 fashion in the last 23 years is true 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.230
 that we still have a lot 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.030
 reach levels of other countries like 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.860
 it can be to the best Germany where the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.810
 selling these shoes or the use of these 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.250
 Sneakers can reach even 25 or 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.630
 30 percent of the total sale of 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.550
 sneakers but in recent years 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.260
 all the big brands have one 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.580
 even several models focused on 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.070
 natura is usually by the law of 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.110
 Christopher McDonald book and have 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.380
 heard about the tarahumara you can 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.810
 I decide to build my fabricarme 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.400
 own huaraches the huarache in theory 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.440
 it's what's called the sandals there in 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.440
 mexico that speaks in this book of a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.730
 tribe that in the copper canyons and 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.960
 that's good since they with their 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.850
 means the means that have what 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.950
 they do is wash their sandals to go 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.660
 as natural as possible and to leave the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.650
 foot as bare as possible that 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.530
 yes you have to 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.930
 at the beginning it is very comfortable when 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.370
 you start to raise the rhythms the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.129
 issue of the blisters because it is urgent 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.719
 the blisters because the sole is 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:46.659
 it's not especially suitable is a piece 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:48.519
 rubber sensations is what we 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.110
 will give if we can do a kilometer 

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:53.080
 more or less we should listen to the body 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.069
 in us we do believe in the the 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.809
 benefit of this type of footwear 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.330
 always well used and knowing how 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:03.279
 How do I know how to spend the case? 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.830
 a little bit more complicated we have it with 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.330
 the client who comes to decorate with a 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.489
 shoe with maximum motivation a 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.099
 training shoe and are interested 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:15.159
 by the big natural here yes that is 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.089
 where the store from the store should 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:19.330
 to do a little more work than 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:21.300
 prescription and customer training 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.330
 it's not 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.639
 a discipline that pretends to compete with 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.520
 the run of usual is another discipline 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.330
 the best advice to try anything 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.970
 daring 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.740
 you have to be daring in this life to 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.289
 everything above all so be patient 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.030
 with the new shoe and not 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.159
 substitute one for another directly 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.330
 I know people who have taken almost a year 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.520
 in being able to adapt to this kind of 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.909
 shoes and as the ultimate goal of a 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.840
 natural runner to take off the huarache 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.419
 and being able to go barefoot 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.430
 with its followers and its detractors what 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.020
 it is clear that the natural running already 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.470
 It has been a gap between the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.470
 runners
