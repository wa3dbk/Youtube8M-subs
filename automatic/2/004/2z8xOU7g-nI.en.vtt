00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.509
 good after the draw and after the game and learn 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.630
 where are you going 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.809
 the last was humiliated 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.759
 meshes in two cases that you can not do better because you do not have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.339
 neither thing nor age 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.449
 that's right 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.449
 one of the cases according to the research 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.499
 This is a provocation. 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.619
 in both cases there is little difference current neither of the two has with a color 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.349
 proof 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.349
 air one of the two has a corporeal 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.640
 any reference in the VIP world 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.220
 come down here 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.610
 You come here blue. 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.199
 in the middle of green how much of empties 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.469
 and here behind maybe due to the government front until September will disclose how 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.780
 That 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.690
 Jessica, he's got to come here with the orange over here and that person has to 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.610
 I came all white 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 where every day that happens inside the opposition 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.290
 they deserve 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.290
 days later 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.020
 this first victory 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.730
 the other case 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.140
 It's when they're not bad eyes. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.400
 I took advantage 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.660
 this calendar effect with them 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.690
 on the other side the same thing they can change places 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.460
 It's after you mention that I should return things here, trying to give the support 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.530
 which is easier 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.050
 and if necessary with them 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.090
 with the delays out 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.800
 we will turn 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.830
 the middle 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 twice 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.020
 there are several ways to do this 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870
 fortunately the cinema 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.890
 I believe I did 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 in fact the power to attract federal revenue 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.370
 the carioquinha 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.770
 if I had lost a medical son 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.220
 she already wrote 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.440
 inefficient 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.690
 cuba in toronto 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.590
 one way he does the following 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.750
 you handle 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 for example if you carry your right hand 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.669
 your day the two layers twice 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.610
 and after days gone away 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.709
 twice 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.509
 all of them 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.289
 all of them 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.019
 fact this twist of italy 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.909
 but it's cool 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.839
 that will happen in this sequence for you to exchange these proposals adapts 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.029
 at 9 o'clock 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.150
 all responsibilities worn 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.640
 the Madeiran of the final because out 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.689
 no problem 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.919
 so say things to do if you're going to do three moments 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.729
 new mutum 2 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.729
 It's all over the world in June. 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:53.010
 only here 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.479
 without you going to have to do 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.479
 the part of the month 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.539
 you start with two first steps ending with two ex-rivals law this 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.249
 without doing anything 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.590
 all things the way he is 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.910
 will someone 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.129
 2 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.539
 on top 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.499
 It's okay like this in the air 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.499
 they will start twice I will defend 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.949
 the mavericks 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.419
 to go to the world a 2nd 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.069
 ah the ing 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.469
 twice and half 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.469
 2 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.959
 both times both on the waterfront 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.589
 in ten games 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.329
 of 2010 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.699
 and it's over 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.369
 For what teaching side? 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.019
 can be anywhere 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.980
 if you start the year 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.629
 you have to do until the end of the month in the air you can schedule culture yourself 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.959
 out-of-home in off-hours hours is always to play 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.319
 I can give 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.479
 the match was also marked 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.959
 As you can see now, we'll give you the money for nothing. 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.619
 then 2 times in the tournament 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.869
 one day 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.619
 okay 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.619
 and now 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.459
 before the earthquake

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.350
 making a goal 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.610
 It can be any way you just have to pack up. 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.669
 here it is important to point out that people will go back 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.189
 then your renewed contracts 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.689
