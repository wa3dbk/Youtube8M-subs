way and it's good for close combat when
you<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.390> big<00:00:39.660> control<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.389 
gun the second one is one notch back
where<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.379> close<00:00:46.590> combat<00:00:46.890> but

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
where it's good for close combat but

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
where it's good for close combat but
it's<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.450> far<00:00:49.079> away<00:00:49.500> enough<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.430> need

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's not it's far away enough to need

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's not it's far away enough to need
control<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.750> gun<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> third<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.829> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
control of your gun the third one is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
control of your gun the third one is
basically<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> same<00:00:54.300> reason<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
basically for the same reason as the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
basically for the same reason as the
second<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.539> -<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.739> 2<00:00:59.430> notches

second one but it's - it's 2 notches
back<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.109> good<00:01:01.859> better<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.460> big<00:01:02.640> guys

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.200 
back and it is good better for big guys
the<00:01:03.809> fourth<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.280> three<00:01:05.640> notches<00:01:05.850> back

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
see I mean as a little window so you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.120 
see I mean as a little window so you
know<00:02:34.060> what<00:02:34.570> how<00:02:34.840> much<00:02:34.990> ammo<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.800> left

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
now this is what gives most of the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.480 
now this is what gives most of the
weight<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.380> gun<00:02:41.560> because<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.160> rest<00:02:42.340> of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
weight to the gun because the rest of

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.060 
weight to the gun because the rest of
the<00:02:42.610> gun<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.970> mostly<00:02:43.450> very<00:02:43.720> lightweight<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.890> it
