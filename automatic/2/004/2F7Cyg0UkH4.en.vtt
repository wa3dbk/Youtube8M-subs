call of duty that you've never seen in
the<00:00:18.960> game<00:00:19.109> because<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the game because it's just not in the in

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.580 
the game because it's just not in the in
the<00:00:21.119> game<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.630> creative<00:00:22.050> class<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.439> just

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the game for creative class it's just

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.320 
the game for creative class it's just
not<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.100> there's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> couple<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.180> them

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
not there and there's a couple of them

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.410 
not there and there's a couple of them
one<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> them<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.500> rainbow<00:00:25.949> zebra

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
one of them was like this rainbow zebra

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.060 
one of them was like this rainbow zebra
poww<00:00:27.420> camo<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> other<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.619> icy

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
poww camo and the other one was this icy

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
poww camo and the other one was this icy
blue<00:00:29.279> kimono<00:00:29.550> now<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.119> figured<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
blue kimono now we figured out that the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.659 
blue kimono now we figured out that the
icy<00:00:31.199> blue<00:00:31.349> camo<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.890> forgetting<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> season

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
icy blue camo was forgetting the season

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.819 
icy blue camo was forgetting the season
pass<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> other<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.320> can't<00:00:34.590> get

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
pass and but the other one you can't get

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
pass and but the other one you can't get
it's<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.640> can't<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's just you can't get it at them in it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's just you can't get it at them in it
so<00:00:36.960> maybe<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.860> future<00:00:38.160> DLC

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so maybe that's going to be future DLC

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.340 
so maybe that's going to be future DLC
or<00:00:38.579> something<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.329> only<00:00:39.570> people

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
or something like that it's only people

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
or something like that it's only people
who<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.500> hacked<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.040> game<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.489> have

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
who have hacked the game that have

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
who have hacked the game that have
actually<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.750> minute<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
actually got it up a minute and so that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
actually got it up a minute and so that
kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.010> leads<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.340> nicely<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> next

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
kind of leads me on nicely into the next

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.900 
kind of leads me on nicely into the next
point<00:00:45.780> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.649> these<00:00:46.920> 15<00:00:47.340> new<00:00:47.579> camos

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.509 
absolutely amazing it's just like it
just<00:02:46.840> looks<00:02:46.989> amazing<00:02:47.049> I've<00:02:47.860> seen<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.160> couple<00:02:48.400> of

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
just looks amazing I've seen a couple of

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.580 
just looks amazing I've seen a couple of
people<00:02:48.790> use<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.209> game<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.690> obviously<00:02:50.230> they've

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
people use in game and obviously they've

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.589 
people use in game and obviously they've
just<00:02:50.739> hacked<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.549> hopefully<00:02:52.060> should<00:02:52.360> be

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
just hacked it so hopefully should be

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.809 
just hacked it so hopefully should be
the<00:02:52.690> case<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.110> these<00:02:53.290> these<00:02:53.829> camos<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:54.610> come

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
the case that these these camos do come

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.690 
the case that these these camos do come
out<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.269> future<00:02:55.930> DLC<00:02:56.410> maybe<00:02:56.709> as<00:02:56.860> part<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.220> DLC

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
out in future DLC maybe as part of DLC

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.759 
out in future DLC maybe as part of DLC
or<00:02:57.730> maybe<00:02:58.030> more<00:02:58.630> likely<00:02:59.079> guess<00:02:59.290> as<00:02:59.470> part<00:02:59.709> of

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
or maybe more likely guess as part of

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.710 
or maybe more likely guess as part of
micro<00:03:00.310> DLC<00:03:00.730> which<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:00.970> like<00:03:01.209> little<00:03:01.390> bits<00:03:01.599> that

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
micro DLC which is like little bits that

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.509 
micro DLC which is like little bits that
you<00:03:01.810> pay<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.230> couple<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.799> dollars<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
you pay a couple of dollars for for the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.949 
you pay a couple of dollars for for the
personalization<00:03:04.060> packs<00:03:04.269> like<00:03:04.630> we<00:03:04.750> had<00:03:04.930> in

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
personalization packs like we had in

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.020 
personalization packs like we had in
black<00:03:05.230> ops<00:03:05.410> 2<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.370> probably<00:03:06.700> slightly

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
black ops 2 that is probably slightly

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.940 
black ops 2 that is probably slightly
more<00:03:07.329> realistic<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:08.200> hopefully<00:03:08.799> we'll<00:03:08.890> get

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
more realistic but hopefully we'll get

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.050 
more realistic but hopefully we'll get
to<00:03:09.010> see<00:03:09.099> some<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.340> these<00:03:09.430> colors<00:03:09.670> because<00:03:09.940> they

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
to see some of these colors because they

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.699
