as<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.759> access<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> notes<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
as you can see access to the notes is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.450 
as you can see access to the notes is
really<00:01:46.320> easy<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.770> okay<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.220> slipping

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
really easy it's okay so just slipping

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
really easy it's okay so just slipping
it<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.810> obviously

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it out of the thing and obviously

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.510 
it out of the thing and obviously
putting<00:01:49.470> them<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.130> simple<00:01:50.430> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
putting them in is really simple you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.770 
putting them in is really simple you
don't<00:01:50.640> even<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> worry<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.450> putting

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
don't even have to worry about putting

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
don't even have to worry about putting
it<00:01:51.869> behind<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.290> elastic<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:53.250> pop<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.820> top

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it behind the elastic just pop it on top

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.910 
it behind the elastic just pop it on top
of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> elastic<00:01:54.689> inside<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> wallet<00:01:55.530> close

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
of the elastic inside the wallet close

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.980 
of the elastic inside the wallet close
it<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.189> put<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> through<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.659> I'll<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it up put it through so I'll do this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
it up put it through so I'll do this
slowly<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> try<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:58.979> give<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> chance

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
slowly now to try and give you a chance

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.280 
slowly now to try and give you a chance
to<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.759> how<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> works<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.899> can't<00:02:01.110> really

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to see how it works but you can't really

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.109 
to see how it works but you can't really
make<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.130> difficult<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> work<00:02:02.880> out

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
make it out it's difficult to work out

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.910 
make it out it's difficult to work out
but<00:02:03.270> what's<00:02:03.659> happening<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> close

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
but what's happening is the as you close

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.440 
but what's happening is the as you close
it<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> elastic<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> pulling<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it the elastic is pulling it to the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.910 
it the elastic is pulling it to the
other

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
other

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.559 
other
I<00:02:06.979> can<00:02:07.400> really<00:02:07.640> share<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.000> very<00:02:08.179> well<00:02:08.360> an

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
I can really share it very well an

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.540 
I can really share it very well an
important<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.590> let's<00:02:09.740> see<00:02:09.860> how<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.220> works<00:02:10.399> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
important so let's see how it works a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.100 
important so let's see how it works a
few<00:02:10.819> notes<00:02:11.000> have<00:02:11.180> got<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> couple<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.660> fives<00:02:11.870> in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
few notes have got a couple of fives in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.380 
few notes have got a couple of fives in
a<00:02:12.200> ten<00:02:12.410> pound<00:02:12.650> note<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.099> works<00:02:13.940> just<00:02:14.060> as<00:02:14.360> well

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
a ten pound note and works just as well

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.360 
a ten pound note and works just as well
with<00:02:14.540> multiple<00:02:15.230> notes<00:02:15.440> still<00:02:16.010> pulling

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
with multiple notes still pulling

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.100 
with multiple notes still pulling
through<00:02:16.700> absolutely<00:02:17.030> no<00:02:17.180> problem<00:02:17.599> it's<00:02:18.050> a

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
through absolutely no problem it's a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.900 
through absolutely no problem it's a
little<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> little<00:02:18.739> tougher<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.760> give

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
little a little tougher you have to give

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.550 
little a little tougher you have to give
it<00:02:20.000> slightly<00:02:20.390> more<00:02:20.540> force<00:02:20.900> by<00:02:21.080> your<00:02:21.230> brain<00:02:21.380> no

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it slightly more force by your brain no

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.190 
it slightly more force by your brain no
way<00:02:21.739> difficult<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.400> do<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.959> tell

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
way difficult to do and but you can tell

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.140 
way difficult to do and but you can tell
a<00:02:24.230> difference<00:02:24.680> between<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.190> three<00:02:25.730> notes

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
a difference between one and three notes

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.820 
a difference between one and three notes
so<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.900> going<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.080> show<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.230> here<00:02:27.500> I'm<00:02:27.709> going

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
one in what I always stay opposite to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.979 
one in what I always stay opposite to
each<00:02:34.700> other<00:02:34.850> if<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> put<00:02:35.390> them<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.600> opposite

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
each other if you put them in opposite

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.620 
each other if you put them in opposite
as<00:02:36.170> I'll<00:02:36.380> show<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.590> now<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.819> 510<00:02:38.450> are

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
as I'll show you now so the 510 are

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.910 
as I'll show you now so the 510 are
always<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.080> stay<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> other<00:02:39.590> side

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
always going to stay on the other side

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.720 
always going to stay on the other side
now<00:02:40.190> because<00:02:40.760> that's<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.269> way<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.450> put<00:02:41.660> them<00:02:41.840> in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
now because that's the way I put them in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.400 
now because that's the way I put them in
always<00:02:43.730> switch<00:02:44.269> over<00:02:44.630> if<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.930> was<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.140> put<00:02:45.290> it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
always switch over if I was to put it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.820 
always switch over if I was to put it
just<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.709> top<00:02:46.010> not<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.760> behind<00:02:47.120> but<00:02:47.299> on<00:02:47.450> top

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
just on top not in behind but on top

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.650 
just on top not in behind but on top
you'll<00:02:48.830> see<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.760> pulls<00:02:49.970> through<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.540> now

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
you'll see that it pulls through and now

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.150 
you'll see that it pulls through and now
they're<00:02:50.870> always<00:02:51.080> going<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.380> stay<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.980> same

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
they're always going to stay on the same

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.130 
they're always going to stay on the same
side<00:02:52.190> whatever<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.970> do<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.690> it's<00:02:53.930> quite<00:02:54.080> simple

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
side whatever I do so it's quite simple

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.800 
side whatever I do so it's quite simple
to<00:02:54.470> get<00:02:54.709> get<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.100> concept<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.269> basically

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
to get get a concept of it basically

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.520 
to get get a concept of it basically
stays<00:02:58.330> with<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.540> notes<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.019> put<00:03:00.200> with<00:03:00.350> it

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
stays with the notes you put with it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.110 
stays with the notes you put with it
so<00:03:00.980> that's<00:03:01.160> how<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.400> deals<00:03:01.580> with<00:03:01.640> cash<00:03:01.880> let's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
so that's how it deals with cash let's

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.660 
so that's how it deals with cash let's
quickly<00:03:02.330> look<00:03:02.510> at<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.920> cards<00:03:04.370> obviously

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
quickly look at the the cards obviously

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.280 
quickly look at the the cards obviously
it's<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> lot<00:03:05.299> simpler<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:06.049> just<00:03:06.200> a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
it's a lot simpler and it's just a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.229 
it's a lot simpler and it's just a
couple<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.650> card<00:03:06.860> slots<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.489> outside<00:03:07.970> and

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
couple of card slots on the outside and

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.650 
couple of card slots on the outside and
I<00:03:09.170> think<00:03:09.260> probably<00:03:09.799> two<00:03:10.280> cards<00:03:10.819> it's<00:03:11.420> going<00:03:11.600> to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
I think probably two cards it's going to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.270 
I think probably two cards it's going to
be<00:03:11.720> comfortable<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.560> could<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.980> could<00:03:13.130> get

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
be comfortable you could you could get

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.030 
be comfortable you could you could get
three<00:03:13.609> in<00:03:13.730> there<00:03:13.940> without<00:03:14.329> too<00:03:14.540> much<00:03:14.690> problem

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
three in there without too much problem

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.340 
three in there without too much problem
but<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.220> two<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.030> think<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.480> going<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.750> be<00:03:17.900> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
but to two I think is going to be the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.099 
but to two I think is going to be the
most<00:03:18.590> sensible<00:03:19.040> for<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.329> avoid<00:03:20.690> sort<00:03:21.049> of

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
most sensible for this and avoid sort of

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.530 
most sensible for this and avoid sort of
stretching<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.739> or<00:03:21.950> bulking<00:03:22.850> or<00:03:23.090> making<00:03:23.420> it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
stretching it or bulking or making it

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.569 
stretching it or bulking or making it
difficult<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.079> access<00:03:24.590> any<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.950> your<00:03:25.100> cards<00:03:25.340> so

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
difficult to access any of your cards so

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.819 
difficult to access any of your cards so
put<00:03:26.390> two<00:03:26.570> cards<00:03:27.109> in<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.320> front<00:03:27.590> there<00:03:27.799> and

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
put two cards in the front there and

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.460 
put two cards in the front there and
between<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.329> back<00:03:29.540> pocket<00:03:29.959> as<00:03:30.049> well<00:03:30.079> this

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
between the back pocket as well this

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.199 
between the back pocket as well this
pocket<00:03:30.709> slightly<00:03:31.340> more<00:03:31.549> difficult<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:32.120> get

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
pocket slightly more difficult to get

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.900 
pocket slightly more difficult to get
into<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.780> that'll<00:03:33.680> get<00:03:33.799> easier<00:03:34.220> over<00:03:34.400> time<00:03:34.519> as

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
into and that'll get easier over time as

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.759 
into and that'll get easier over time as
the<00:03:35.000> wallet<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:35.359> used<00:03:35.630> offices<00:03:36.109> brand-new
