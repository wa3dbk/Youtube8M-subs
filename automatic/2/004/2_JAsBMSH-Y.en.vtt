we first had a working relationship with
Crohn's<00:00:44.880> back<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:45.630> thousand<00:00:46.290> when<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.040> put

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
in a Stan occur brew house and we were

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.390 
in a Stan occur brew house and we were
looking<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:51.090> new<00:00:51.360> technologies<00:00:52.400> well

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
looking for some new technologies well

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.840 
looking for some new technologies well
that<00:00:54.030> would<00:00:54.239> give<00:00:54.480> us<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.750> efficiency<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
that would give us more efficiency and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
that would give us more efficiency and
also<00:00:56.850> give<00:00:57.690> us<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.900> higher<00:00:58.110> quality<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
also give us a higher quality and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.700 
also give us a higher quality and
repeatable<00:00:59.550> consistent<00:01:00.449> product<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.989> we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
repeatable consistent product and we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.259 
repeatable consistent product and we
found<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.040> in<00:01:02.250> Steiner<00:01:02.489> kurz<00:01:02.760> brew<00:01:03.090> house

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
found that in Steiner kurz brew house

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.690 
found that in Steiner kurz brew house
with<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> Merlin<00:01:04.019> wort<00:01:04.830> boiling<00:01:05.160> system<00:01:05.550> and

with a Merlin wort boiling system and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.660 
with a Merlin wort boiling system and
we're<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.600> happy<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.310> came

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
we're very happy with it when it came

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.109 
we're very happy with it when it came
time<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:08.940> us<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.520> need<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.550> new<00:01:11.610> bottle<00:01:11.850> on

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
time for us to need a new bottle on

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
time for us to need a new bottle on
because<00:01:12.690> we<00:01:12.810> were<00:01:12.899> at<00:01:12.990> capacity<00:01:13.170> constraints

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
because we were at capacity constraints
