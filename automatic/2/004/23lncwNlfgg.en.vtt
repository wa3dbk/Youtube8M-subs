because at first it's kind of confusing
um<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:19.280> not<00:02:19.400> easy<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.879> show<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.510> used

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
um it's not easy to show in I used

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.459 
um it's not easy to show in I used
between<00:02:21.319> 280<00:02:22.159> and<00:02:22.400> 300<00:02:22.909> degrees<00:02:22.969> no<00:02:23.870> more<00:02:24.170> and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
between 280 and 300 degrees no more and

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.240 
between 280 and 300 degrees no more and
what<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.459> did<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.060> had<00:02:26.299> to<00:02:26.329> once<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.829> gone<00:02:27.859> by

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
what I did I had to once this is gone by

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.830 
what I did I had to once this is gone by
the<00:02:28.310> way<00:02:28.430> once<00:02:28.969> I've<00:02:29.150> sectioned<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.599> hair

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
the way once I've sectioned the hair

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.740 
the way once I've sectioned the hair
into<00:02:30.079> small<00:02:30.319> sections<00:02:30.590> um<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.909> did<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.390> motion

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
into small sections um I did this motion

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.679 
into small sections um I did this motion
right<00:02:32.780> here<00:02:33.200> very<00:02:34.010> fast<00:02:34.400> very<00:02:34.730> fast<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.540> this

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
right here very fast very fast like this

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.289 
right here very fast very fast like this
like<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:37.159> did<00:02:37.340> do<00:02:37.459> section<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.239> of

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
like that and I did do section so of

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.179 
like that and I did do section so of
course<00:02:38.510> whatever<00:02:38.870> section<00:02:39.319> I'm<00:02:39.409> doing<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.920> just

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
course whatever section I'm doing I just

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.729 
course whatever section I'm doing I just
do<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:40.639> really<00:02:40.939> fast<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.599> way<00:02:42.049> because

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
do this really fast and that way because

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.830 
do this really fast and that way because
I<00:02:42.889> found<00:02:43.189> when<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.579> concentrate<00:02:44.329> too<00:02:44.659> much

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
I found when you concentrate too much

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.629 
I found when you concentrate too much
heat<00:02:45.109> you<00:02:45.590> would<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.069> little<00:02:46.370> crimp

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
heat you would have this little crimp

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.520 
heat you would have this little crimp
thing<00:02:46.879> right<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.599> basically<00:02:48.049> think

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
thing right here and you basically think

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.129 
thing right here and you basically think
you<00:02:48.709> melted<00:02:49.129> your<00:02:49.280> hair<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:50.239> no<00:02:50.599> not<00:02:50.900> really

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
you melted your hair but no not really

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.050 
you melted your hair but no not really
just<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.560> go<00:02:51.799> through<00:02:52.129> very<00:02:52.489> very<00:02:52.790> very

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
just have to go through very very very

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.759 
just have to go through very very very
quickly

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
quickly

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.920 
quickly
and<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:55.189> will<00:02:55.340> smooth<00:02:55.700> out<00:02:55.879> just<00:02:56.269> fine<00:02:56.510> so

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
and it will smooth out just fine so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.509 
and it will smooth out just fine so
those<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.650> some<00:02:57.799> pointers<00:02:58.220> when<00:02:58.370> you're

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
those are some pointers when you're

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.199 
those are some pointers when you're
shortening<00:02:58.849> synthetic<00:02:59.840> hair<00:03:00.319> um<00:03:00.739> yes<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.090> go

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
through really quickly and don't put the

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.800 
through really quickly and don't put the
temperature<00:03:04.129> too<00:03:04.519> high<00:03:04.549> or<00:03:05.389> else<00:03:05.629> you're
