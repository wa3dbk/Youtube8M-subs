00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 hello beautiful thighs how are you 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 the less it's okay so listen 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.019
 today a little special video that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.599
 is going to be in helmet contest response 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.610
 about the following subject for you 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.050
 what is the biker spirit 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.420
 so since I am a 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.810
 young biker I did not really have 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.329
 the experience needed to really 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:46.170
 encompass the subject wrap the issue 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 but yesterday yesterday I came across so a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.699
 group of bikers and hookups and there 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.960
 I saw the biker spirit in full swing 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.350
 that was the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.650
 the pinnacle of the mind so I 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.650
 explains 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.780
 for me already the biker spirit is so 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 a state of mind is a way of 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.360
 think 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.770
 it's something that is not dictated 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.600
 not and it is variable depending on 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.330
 people so there is more or less 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.920
 every person feels the spirit 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:25.240
 motorcyclist differently especially to his 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.460
 felt pretty done enough to these 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.390
 experiences so here are his experiences 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.550
 past and late so let it be 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.220
 a fall whether it's encounters that 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.600
 it's surprises of accidents 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.580
 here are each evaluates the biker spirit in 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.070
 according to his skills and his 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 experience 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.210
 so here and like thursday 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.890
 the biker spirit includes all 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.590
 agree that this is 1.50 a scooter that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.490
 it's a moped it's a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.210
 big engine a harlem 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.420
 that's the moment you say I'm a 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.610
 biker I am equipped for 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.489
 I know risks I know the dangers 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.310
 and I realize that the road does not 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.470
 does not belong to me and belongs to the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.140
 other 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.520
 but that others 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.190
 they are not paying attention to me so 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.680
 we must start from the principle or the others 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.100
 did not see me and so that's why 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 than 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.840
 you have to share the road by doing 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.060
 watch out for me the biker spirit 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.310
 he is someone who knows his dangers 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 who knows the dangers is who and who 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.320
 knows another biker is risking his life 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.370
 every day while driving it's for 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.710
 that there are signs so lifted we 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.800
 made to other bikers so it's for 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.050
 already greeted for saying hi the friend of 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.230
 witnesses later taha the same dangers and to 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.390
 kill a proof to you cold 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.130
 show proof of the mosquitoes you not 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 have bees 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.220
 you have all that all the charm 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.230
 motorcycle and at the same time 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.340
 cons 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.160
 because it's true what's more beautiful 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.250
 than 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.080
 than to go for a ride and all of a sudden 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.490
 we go to the shade in cold weather 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.560
 hot 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.440
 but you feel the show I feel there the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.060
 sun is hitting on you 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.580
 and frankly there is nothing more 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.590
 nice for me the biker spirit if that 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:41.980
 it is the risk consciousness then 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.670
 the biker spirit is also the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.360
 respect and learning 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.970
 so I saw I have a led yesterday 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.860
 with big guys you see I tell you 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.660
 some of the guys are those who attack the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.550
 there guys are arsouilles hours 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.950
 from the extreme joe bar team 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.110
 I swear to you I am a young person 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.420
 driver we'll say that with five months 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.520
 I have the license 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.860
 it's been five months since I allowed it 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.840
 did I went there I went that 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.430
 twice in the mountain so I do not 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.340
 do not know I do not know too much 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.190
 I do not know too much about them 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.440
 the arsouilles and ikki at and I was 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.989
 all the time is dragging her then you see at 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.900
 early it's been a little bit a little bit 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.190
 damn guy what's shaking it serves 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.440
 we will wait for it all the time 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.690
 no I thought I was thinking about it 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.000
 early I said damn they count they 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.560
 are going to tell me go go free break no 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.260
 so I told them every time 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.550
 excuse me in the morning the pope gets there 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.419
 you had time to drink tea 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.090
 no I have always said his house there 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.440
 is attacked it's normal you learn 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.680
 then you follow my wheels you will follow 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.840
 my wheels and you will try to on my 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.639
 direction 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.630
 even though the guy still remained a 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.760
 time to roll to 50 years of turns to 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.550
 really teach me me I find that 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.830
 that's nice that sharing leaves the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.930
 fair play 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.170
 we will say he is but knew 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.750
 was aware that it's hard 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.000
 afraid at first and the guy was aware 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.700
 of that and and he tried to the best of 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.700
 requests jacket butter to try to 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.590
 here he taught me seems to judge 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.350
 and that I think it's beautiful 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:29.000
 the mutual help here is a big word 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.790
 the one between help if a biker will help 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.220
 always another biker whatever 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.920
 in real life whether it's on 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.870
 internet but a biker will always help 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:45.590
 a biker and finally I also find that 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.710
 being a biker reinforces 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.710
 connections between people and create more 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.240
 easily from the friendship I have and I have 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.760
 I'm done my little group of friends 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.590
 it is true that I was certain that 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.570
 I lost sight of and since I 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.780
 ride a bike I recreated a group 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.950
 friends really we get along well 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.410
 they do not have the same level of motorcycles 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.950
 that they do not have the same experience 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:13.400
 and are older but it does not matter 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.360
 age here I am friends of good 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.730
 friends they're 27 years old i 'm 20 years old i 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.190
 would never have had that kind of relationship 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.740
 if I would not ride a bike because 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.300
 that I think the bike is really 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.550
 universal I know people on 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.099
 internet so blogger motorbikes by 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.310
 example of phonemes ti 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:41.129
 he is younger then me but 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.580
 milan 50 he is younger than me and I 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.610
 get along great with 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.360
 I totally disregarded his 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.969
 age and when we talk about motorcycles ben here 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.009
 there is only the bike the bike is 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:58.490
 universal it is at all ages every 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:02.930
 sexes and all the displacements of the moment 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.949
 where we have this desire and we know them 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.979
 risks to each other 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:13.159
 mutual respect is that which is for 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:15.199
 me really important and primordial and 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.090
 that's it for me the definition of 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.610
 the biker spirit 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:24.669
 so that was my point of view 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.669
 of the biker spirit my feeling 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.009
 here I tell you see you soon friends 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.930
 be careful on the roads 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:34.630
 respect yourself 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.710
 and to more friends and that they are noon 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.710
 to or yahoo
