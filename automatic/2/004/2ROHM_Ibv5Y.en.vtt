00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hey guys haven't done a mod video in

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.740 
hey guys haven't done a mod video in
quite<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.319> while<00:00:04.380> but<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.040> just<00:00:05.549> finished<00:00:06.120> off<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
quite a while but I just finished off a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.799 
quite a while but I just finished off a
titanium<00:00:07.820> converted<00:00:08.820> mini<00:00:09.090> champ<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.630> was

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
titanium converted mini champ it was

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.129 
titanium converted mini champ it was
quite<00:00:09.990> proud<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> wanted<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:12.110> do<00:00:13.110> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
quite proud of that so I wanted to do a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.330 
quite proud of that so I wanted to do a
quick<00:00:13.230> video<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.790> has<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:16.379> liners

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
quick video of that this has the liners

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.000 
quick video of that this has the liners
both<00:00:17.970> liners<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> bull<00:00:18.869> scales<00:00:19.230> made<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.740> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
both liners and bull scales made out of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.870 
both liners and bull scales made out of
grade<00:00:20.550> 5<00:00:20.730> titanium<00:00:21.470> hand<00:00:22.470> cut<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.920> hand

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
grade 5 titanium hand cut and hand

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.000 
grade 5 titanium hand cut and hand
profiled<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.990> hand<00:00:25.140> sanded<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.830> those

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
profiled and hand sanded all of those

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.200 
profiled and hand sanded all of those
and<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.910> was<00:00:27.029> quite<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.240> job<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:29.490> other

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and it was it was quite a job the other

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
and it was it was quite a job the other
problem<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.660> most<00:00:31.019> people<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.769> doing

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
problem that most people have with doing

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
problem that most people have with doing
titanium<00:00:32.759> against<00:00:33.090> steel<00:00:33.450> tools<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
titanium against steel tools is that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
titanium against steel tools is that
they<00:00:34.980> will<00:00:35.160> gall<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.600> did

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
they will gall and what I actually did

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.369 
they will gall and what I actually did
on<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.469> between<00:00:37.950> each<00:00:38.870> Kevin<00:00:39.870> point<00:00:40.079> on

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
on this in between each Kevin point on

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.400 
on this in between each Kevin point on
each<00:00:40.800> line<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.250> each<00:00:41.370> scale<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.050> carbonized<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
each line on each scale I carbonized so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.889 
each line on each scale I carbonized so
I<00:00:43.440> deposited<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.520> thin<00:00:45.090> layer<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.360> carbide

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I deposited a thin layer of carbide

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
I deposited a thin layer of carbide
there<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.890> happens<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> tools

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
there so what happens is the tools

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.560 
there so what happens is the tools
actually<00:00:48.000> move<00:00:48.680> super<00:00:49.680> slick<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.570> there's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
actually move super slick that's there's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
actually move super slick that's there's
no<00:00:51.719> galling<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.860> open<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
no galling at all and they open and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
no galling at all and they open and
close<00:00:55.430> perfect<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.690> couldn't<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.750> happier<00:00:58.140> with

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
close perfect I couldn't be happier with

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.950 
close perfect I couldn't be happier with
how<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.469> turned<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.730> actually<00:01:00.000> one

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
how this turned out so it's actually one

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.119 
how this turned out so it's actually one
of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> first<00:01:01.260> few<00:01:01.500> times<00:01:01.680> I've<00:01:01.829> used<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
of the first few times I've used the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
of the first few times I've used the
carbon<00:01:02.489> Iser<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.359> happy<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.840> how

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
carbon Iser but I'm very happy with how

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.899 
carbon Iser but I'm very happy with how
it<00:01:04.500> worked<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.979> I've<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> nice<00:01:06.390> lightweight

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
it worked so I've got a nice lightweight

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.679 
it worked so I've got a nice lightweight
fully<00:01:08.909> converted<00:01:10.159> mini<00:01:11.159> champ<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.790> I'm

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
fully converted mini champ and I'm

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.800 
fully converted mini champ and I'm
pretty<00:01:12.869> happy<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.600> tools

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
pretty happy with this all the tools

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.420 
pretty happy with this all the tools
open<00:01:16.049> nicely<00:01:18.380> there's<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.530> stickiness<00:01:19.979> it's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
open nicely there's no stickiness it's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.300 
open nicely there's no stickiness it's
all<00:01:20.610> smooth<00:01:21.619> now<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> course<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> lose<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
all smooth now of course you lose the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.630 
all smooth now of course you lose the
scale<00:01:23.640> tools<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:25.189> it's<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.580> an

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
scale tools because it's not really an

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
scale tools because it's not really an
easy<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> incorporate<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.259> pen<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
easy way to incorporate the pen or the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
easy way to incorporate the pen or the
tweezers<00:01:29.310> maybe<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> future<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> could

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
tweezers maybe in the future I could

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.170 
tweezers maybe in the future I could
figure<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.320> something<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
figure out something but for now this is

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.890 
figure out something but for now this is
just<00:01:33.479> straight<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.310> scale<00:01:35.310> swap<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
just straight up scale swap out and the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
just straight up scale swap out and the
way<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.200> works<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.430> used<00:01:39.590> 0<00:01:40.590> 80<00:01:40.920> threaded

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
way this works is I used 0 80 threaded

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
way this works is I used 0 80 threaded
three<00:01:42.090> pitch<00:01:42.299> torque<00:01:42.630> screws<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.399> are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
three pitch torque screws so they are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
three pitch torque screws so they are
drilled<00:01:44.850> through<00:01:45.290> sixteenth<00:01:46.290> inch<00:01:46.470> hole<00:01:46.649> from

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
drilled through sixteenth inch hole from

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.580 
drilled through sixteenth inch hole from
the<00:01:47.040> top<00:01:47.399> scale<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.780> middle<00:01:49.020> liners<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the top scale and the middle liners and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
the top scale and the middle liners and
the<00:01:49.680> back<00:01:49.890> scale<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.140> threaded

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the back scale is actually the threaded

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710 
the back scale is actually the threaded
one<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> screws<00:01:53.729> go<00:01:53.909> through<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
one so the screws go through all the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.370 
one so the screws go through all the
tools<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.610> screw<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> threaded<00:01:57.380> back

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
tools and screw into the threaded back

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
tools and screw into the threaded back
scale<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.460> actually<00:01:59.610> worked<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.000> pretty

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
scale so it's actually worked out pretty

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.030 
scale so it's actually worked out pretty
pretty<00:02:00.930> nicely<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.380> pretty<00:02:01.560> happy<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.920> its

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
pretty nicely I'm pretty happy with its

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.910 
pretty nicely I'm pretty happy with its
first<00:02:02.250> time<00:02:02.399> I've<00:02:02.520> tried<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.560> see<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
first time I've tried it see all the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.989 
first time I've tried it see all the
tools<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.880> snap<00:02:08.539> alright<00:02:09.539> thanks<00:02:09.959> guys
