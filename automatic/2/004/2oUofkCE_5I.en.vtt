00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.729
 when playing two of them some of them are Siamese brothers 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.029
 to wedy 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.929
 the Aryans 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.189
 the pavement says of an office building 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.759
 the bathroom area 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.270
 each in a flat area 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.220
 past 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 the first thing you should 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.499
 on the thickness of feathers 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.499
 in case they ride 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.710
 but I separated myself bidding 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.410
 with this book 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.690
 martinho de almeida guilherme 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.170
 two doors 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.510
 some securities 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.950
 the penalties 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.040
 one way 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.370
 simple to solve by sinning 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 of the 13 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.660
 3 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.970
 and I have is that the thickness of the lines 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.750
 a simple way so 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 in less than two weeks 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 and doing the following 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 to get injured 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.269
 the thickness is 0 points 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.720
 13 millimeters 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.460
 and then 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.890
 the masonry 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 the coordinator who in the Netherlands 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 bento xvi homes selected 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.539
 I'll put the thickness 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.270
 it will be 40 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 it's not the best way 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 however simple the problems are 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.640
 is set once this setting 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.520
 only in the middle 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 with this lw inter button 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.290
 you can view 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.710
 the injured people 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.160
 these people is not true either 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.540
 tomorrow 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 simply a way of showing on the screen put this 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 notice now 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 the print command 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.910
 can be used 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.760
 two ways 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 with an impression directly in online mode 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.219
 or believe in christmas 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.439
 Let's start with the bike. 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.439
 the mobile printing can be used 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.109
 a preview 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.369
 predicting 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.369
 in them then we will continue 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.449
 thirty years in charge of the institution 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.269
 or strong 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.129
 I have this picture 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 who often tip their hobbies 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.759
 the new schalke sweater 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.529
 I have here 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.949
 the dark water printer 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.030
 check out the printers I have 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.019
 the words 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.569
 on the computer 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.569
 the bus and from the 2007 version 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.729
 has the direct impression to the court that the pdf 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.399
 so it was chosen 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.439
 a press simulation 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.349
 another thing that I'm going to do 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.029
 to choose 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.029
 choose a veneer 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.569
 most used 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.099
 Here in Brazil 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.870
 so have a 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.549
 four kinds of green cause 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.789
 the police 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.789
 and went horizontal 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.909
 another thing I have to do 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.529
 is here 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:23.839
 The chosen one 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.849
 the queen's title 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.309
 in a statement 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.979
 he asks if you want to apply said yes 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.639
 I chose the world 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.049
 this impression of the world the club will make all the 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.799
 six free companies 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.489
 however there is an exception 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.150
 I'm going to get out of this depression a bit 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
 we can only address this issue of scut 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.439
 and I'll come in 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.799
 here in the travel chart 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.289
 where I go here 9 0 who get into the frame of thing again 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.229
 eight years later 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.659
 this stage with his health because he has three days 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.539
 this is more is this one 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.779
 Working hard 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.979
 with monochrome printing 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.499
 of these 255 exhibitions 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.570
 in this table I always leave companies 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.799
 if they did not do the noise inspection 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.159
 I click on this one necklace option 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.159
 and then I make a configuration 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.889
 won 10 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.990
 16 million in resources 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.919
 these things are 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.060
 stewardship reform 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.620
 for three numbers 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.529
 separated by commas 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.080
 and any 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.779
 the estate of the old 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.499
 at the time of printing 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.389
 even if the choice is 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.999
 this print is frog 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.139
 but left unharmed 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.360
 in the case of black and white laser printers 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.270
 this impression but we left with distinction compatible 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.189
 with this tone of press 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.189
 returning to the picture of depression 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.229
 something else that is important 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.879
 to do it 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.539
 the choice of the English area 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.120
 ae 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 in this session 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.279
 have to select the print area 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.889
 and now the press has appeared 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930
 another thing is to scale 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:35.629
 click here 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.469
 turn off this button 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.069
 and I will choose was here 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.150
 these scales question 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.729
 available on the bus 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:45.939
 in the installation 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.069
 not for development 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.139
 we need to be reconfigured after 10 years in one 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.150
 the posthumous 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.789
 pass a sea ruler 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.460
 the fiscal adjustment 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.460
 in this first value I put value 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:04.879
 bye 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.919
 Why I draw medicine is my fury is in millimeters 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.249
 at the moment it's a thousand 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.610
 and down here 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.869
 I put 

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:16.969
 the scale they want from me 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.969
 the vocalist lot 200 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.330
 I still have it here 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.190
 once 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.550
 we will see fundamental measures 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.089
 I can 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.619
 team to centralize the newly 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.749
 and I can also make position adjustments here 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.860
 I can apply this setting 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.860
 al muhamadi is not intimidated 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.400
 I figure it will change again. 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.399
 in the same place of origin 

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.520
 I have a preview 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.080
 in this position 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.080
 that appears wrote 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.069
 force and impulsion of viva 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.080
 once would have chosen this position ok 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.430
 the file name appears 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.399
 that see me here 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.639
 serginho 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.080
 I do not really 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.240
 with that impression 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.969
 Opening pv 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.839
 I have is what interests 

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.839
 the two floors of the building 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.039
 to put things into the drawing will require the situation 

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:42.210
 to keep the disease away 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.819
 he will be examined in the next hour
