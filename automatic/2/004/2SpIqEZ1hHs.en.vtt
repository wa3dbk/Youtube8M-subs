00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.210
 Y 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 very good today 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.610
 a new video that has to do with the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.520
 history of these new maps good of 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.540
 this new map we want to give the name 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.310
 of the map is weekly 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.430
 howard and something even interesting is that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 wrigley forward is because an event is a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.550
 like that one was an event a project 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.129
 of the government of china and that is what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.350
 curious here how good if you are 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.059
 seeing the pattern of these maps the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 first the first map was called green 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.350
 room the second one is calling great 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.949
 light power the wind ron green room was 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.320
 a USA project of the forces of 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.360
 the us military which consisted 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.729
 in hanford california that is where it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.830
 find the wind zombies map this 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.570
 throw as well as that chemical does not remember 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.549
 the name of the chemist this throw it like this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.049
 like that in the air to try more or 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.970
 less the effects that weapons have 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.940
 nuclear enemies in them 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.000
 then they say they scattered 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.330
 all this this chemical by air and in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.799
 instead of resulting in something scientific in 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.299
 something that you can say good then 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.350
 I learned something from this thing that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.479
 military say that if it works 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.240
 and it turned out that there was too much radiation 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.450
 in hanford and the animals they were 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 radiated in the plants of 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.780
 everything everything that had to do with 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.360
 plants with food some children 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.280
 they were affected because they took 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.619
 milk from cows that were exposed to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.329
 bone radiation all that and let's say that 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.490
 this project ended in catastrophe 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.310
 because at the end of the day it was like 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.130
 that a great great great in a great 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.039
 Radiation result in the whole field 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.619
 of california and watling howard is a 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.789
 china project 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.250
 that it was around the 1960s if 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.750
 I'm not wrong and this project is grayling 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.880
 howard in Spanish means a great 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.490
 I take a big step forward a great 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.439
 advancement 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 this project was from the government of china 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.120
 which was that everyone tried 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.370
 as well as that to the extreme as well as that 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.890
 turn something rural into something 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.950
 completely advanced then it's like 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.140
 for example if yes they produced I say is 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.280
 an example did not occur this three 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 kilos of iron per month that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.860
 produce 300 then it's that the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.260
 Chinese were fully activated this one 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.290
 they tried too hard 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.690
 too many this one had too much 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.239
 agriculture all everything everything they did 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.680
 too much and what happened what 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.329
 not does me good history the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.159
 I have not really done my homework well 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.709
 ok the story but it turns out that something 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.930
 something like this serve you faced too much 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.299
 they did not stick too much so I know 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.129
 high form the name in Spanish is 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.210
 having too many crops have 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.950
 too many crops 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.080
 and say that everything is fine seeing 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.720
 those crops and the weather was pretty 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.480
 well they saw it quite nice but of the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.430
 nothing this I do not know I do not know I do not know what 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.990
 it happened because it was rain that fell one 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.060
 rain but incredible or a storm 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.710
 incredible or flooded in some way not 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.830
 I know I do not know in any way the water came to 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.870
 those harvests and left them without harvests or 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.450
 those of hosting 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.409
 without food he left them with nothing and then 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.120
 let's say you have nothing else 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.090
 too exhausted and therefore without food 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.310
 I was a bastard and it turned out that this is 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.549
 loss of crops resulted in near 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.489
 30 million Chinese deaths because 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.110
 do not have to eat and then treyarch 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.060
 I do not know what the hell he's doing I do not know 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.040
 what the hell have green ron in mind 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.349
 a US project that ends in 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.260
 catastrophe watling howard is a project 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.640
 of china that ends in catastrophe and if 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.140
 continue with this pattern possibly the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.430
 three other maps that follow also go 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.400
 to be government projects that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.349
 they ended in catastrophe I do not know that they are 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.690
 planning the trier ones that seriously this 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.420
 if my theory is correct and the next one goes 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.989
 to be in Paris there must be some 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.519
 project that she has finished in 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.310
 catastrophe in france or something by the 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.420
 style because I do not know what the hell is 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.239
 thinking again I do not know what the hell 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.280
 want but but he 's doing the 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.570
 things too be too much 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.160
 interesting is another interesting thing 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.180
 about this project the great game 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.460
 award is that in 1500 they were 1,516 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.139
 that there was a meteor shower in 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.729
 lantana in that not so one and china I do not know 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.320
 where the hell is that but it is that 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.389
 that a meteorite juve and the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.849
 largest fragment of the meteorite it 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.260
 they took Japan to Tokyo Japan and what 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.479
 they have exhibition in the museum of 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.070
 science and nature the important thing of 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.419
 this meteorite help is that where 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.430
 during this time the great lift 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.990
 Howard asked the Chinese to 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.570
 they got iron they get iron 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.340
 from where outside to be able to increase the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.280
 production of this product to be able 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.389
 increase metal production 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.949
 so then it was that it melted in 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.539
 melted metal things do not already 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.770
 they remove things for anything to 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.930
 have more iron and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.190
 and other people went to look for iron 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.500
 as well as in minecraft you are going to look 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.780
 iron this people went to look 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.400
 metal minerals and it turns out that 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.889
 they found pieces of metal and 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.430
 they said good let's melt it for 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.800
 can create more iron and it turns out that 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.650
 these minerals these bits of 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.789
 -according to them- iron were pieces of the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.729
 meteorite were was mineral to liberate me 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.159
 iron meteorites and they looked from this 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.970
 way here as you can see this is a 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:38.360
 fragment of one of these terminals 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.159
 meteorite these irons that they found 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.050
 there in China and it does not remind you of something like that 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:49.069
 as you see this fragment does not 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.849
 remember this to 115 apple meteor 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.950
 china life rice everything is well meaning 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.500
 now 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.570
 it's quite interesting this 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.000
 and well, if this meteorite is 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.730
 practically identical to the meteorite 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.190
 of 115 elements 115 and it's something pretty 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.670
 interesting possibly the group does not 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.670
 35 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.210
 China sent him this 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.330
 this meteorite this element 115 to the 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.580
 group 9 35 and 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.020
 and so they have an alliance because 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.159
 you remember that they had an alliance 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.840
 with japan then possibly also 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.979
 with china then well nothing more than 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.870
 nothing so that they knew that so that 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.939
 they knew why the name of the maps 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.400
 this one if you want to know more about this 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:37.620
 then teach it to be investigated 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.970
 same and so if it is necessary to be a video 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.350
 completely explaining this as 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.850
 I'm going to do, you know, it's not me 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.919
 no problem I like to make videos of 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.320
 this kind of story but then nothing 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.460
 gentlemen that would be all remember that the 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.930
 of troy that are new loquillo if 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.970
 they always have the story plans of 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.220
 made this from china of the wild life 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.590
 hour leaves from kinder totem in the 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.820
 wii version this distinguishes us the 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.710
 history the team planned since 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.050
 came out the almost almost is and is 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.610
 incredible because such a long story 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.259
 and that they adapt the each type of 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.600
 good game to each game has managed to 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.010
 black ops and backup 2 is very 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.330
 bastard for the tutorials never leave 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.830
 to surprise the gentlemen and that nothing 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.380
 grace to see gentlemen think a lot 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.800
 we see later bye it's not true 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.800
 goodbye
