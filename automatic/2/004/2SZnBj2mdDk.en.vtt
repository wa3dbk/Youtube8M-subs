they were 16-ounce bottles and they were
I<00:03:58.970> remember<00:03:59.970> what<00:04:00.060> they<00:04:00.150> were

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.129 

let<00:04:03.780> me<00:04:03.870> think<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:05.030> think<00:04:06.030> they<00:04:06.090> were<00:04:06.150> twelve

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139
