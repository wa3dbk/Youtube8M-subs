00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 welcome to the world of survival and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 expected by many and we enter 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.179
 in the application of 27 suddenly saurus 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.099
 here we see how it is going and we start 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.009
 with the common name explanation 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 brontosaurus soon saved thrown as 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.939
 species is from the herbivore Cretaceous and 2 and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.490
 his wild way among the most creatures 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.470
 great views on the island says that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.840
 soon sauros lazarus is the largest 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.630
 of any sauropod on which I have 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
 read indeed the dinosaur is so 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 massive that ignores most of the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.890
 creatures on the island I've seen a herd 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.510
 of raptor to tear apart a dinosaur 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.059
 small while suddenly saurios follows 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.539
 eating seemingly oblivious to the package 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.960
 that are hunting we go that as it happens of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.240
 everything can be stepped on that he 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.310
 domesticated because it is docile to 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.190
 soon secure base of animal load 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.440
 ideal many peaceful tribes what 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.240
 they use to carry large quantities 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 of resources while the tribes of 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.220
 war they use to mobilize their 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.860
 army unfortunately its enormity 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.550
 means that most attempts 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.250
 to take it can take our 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.800
 as long as any other creature of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 this island some may think that this 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.020
 it is an apatosaurus an argentinosaurus u 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 other fingers it is a strange island 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.509
 a strange world and I am the one who does the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 investigation here eye I'm convinced 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.860
 that this genre is suddenly saurus and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.590
 no one can tell me otherwise my 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.330
 I study my rules now I'm more in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.580
 doubt who is the one who writes these two 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.050
 years we are going to give it to you and I hope this 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.840
 I have served you a little more than 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.640
 information about these 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.079
 what are we going to do, I invite you to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.270
 enter the channel discuss what 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.979
 you want to comment I have a lot of a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.439
 way is that there is everything that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.380
 surely it could be provoking you 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.729
 orgasm of laughter from those that you already because 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.069
