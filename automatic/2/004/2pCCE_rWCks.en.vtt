00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.450 
physically gifted quarterback in the NFL
he's<00:00:28.930> that<00:00:29.080> talented<00:00:29.290> as<00:00:29.620> a<00:00:29.650> runner<00:00:29.950> as<00:00:30.160> a

he's that talented as a runner as a
passer<00:00:30.970> really<00:00:31.570> got<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.750> come<00:00:31.900> along<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.320> keep

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
working on his accuracy keep learning

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.610 
working on his accuracy keep learning
the<00:00:34.030> playbook<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:34.540> keep<00:00:34.660> developing<00:00:34.930> but

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
the playbook and keep developing but

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.140 
the playbook and keep developing but
he's<00:00:35.710> definitely<00:00:35.890> shown<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.490> ton<00:00:36.610> of<00:00:36.670> potential

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
he's definitely shown a ton of potential

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.550 
he's definitely shown a ton of potential
his<00:00:37.390> first<00:00:37.570> season<00:00:37.720> I<00:00:38.020> think<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.320> lot<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.470> people

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
his first season I think a lot of people

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.780 
his first season I think a lot of people
were<00:00:38.770> surprised<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.220> they<00:00:39.370> did<00:00:39.550> come<00:00:39.700> out

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
were surprised that they did come out

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.100 
were surprised that they did come out
throwing<00:00:40.030> as<00:00:40.239> much<00:00:40.420> they<00:00:40.600> did<00:00:40.750> with<00:00:40.870> those<00:00:40.930> two

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
throwing as much they did with those two

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.450 
throwing as much they did with those two
running<00:00:41.380> backs<00:00:41.410> they<00:00:41.650> didn't<00:00:41.890> run<00:00:42.010> it<00:00:42.160> to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
running backs they didn't run it to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.979 
running backs they didn't run it to
protect<00:00:42.850> him<00:00:43.000> they<00:00:43.120> let<00:00:43.270> him<00:00:43.420> just<00:00:43.570> go<00:00:43.720> after

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
protect him they let him just go after

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.479 
protect him they let him just go after
but<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.410> all<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.530> concerns<00:00:44.950> that<00:00:45.040> evaluate

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
but of all the concerns that evaluate

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.460 
but of all the concerns that evaluate
errs<00:00:45.579> had<00:00:45.790> on<00:00:45.970> cam<00:00:46.239> strictly<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.079> field

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
errs had on cam strictly on the field

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.110 
errs had on cam strictly on the field
what's<00:00:47.950> been<00:00:48.100> answered<00:00:48.399> so<00:00:48.520> far<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:49.030> what

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
what's been answered so far and what

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.729 
what's been answered so far and what
still<00:00:49.329> needs<00:00:49.390> work<00:00:49.600> I<00:00:50.020> came<00:00:50.500> out<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:50.680> the

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
still needs work I came out in the

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.440 
still needs work I came out in the
preseason<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.340> they<00:00:51.430> look<00:00:51.610> very<00:00:51.640> spotty<00:00:52.180> with

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
preseason and they look very spotty with

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.360 
preseason and they look very spotty with
his<00:00:52.570> accuracy<00:00:52.930> is<00:00:53.380> mechanics<00:00:53.980> I<00:00:54.100> think<00:00:54.280> there

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
his accuracy is mechanics I think there

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.979 
his accuracy is mechanics I think there
was<00:00:54.489> some<00:00:54.610> major<00:00:54.970> questions<00:00:55.540> about<00:00:55.809> how<00:00:55.930> he

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
was some major questions about how he

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.360 
was some major questions about how he
was<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.320> fare<00:00:56.590> as<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.739> passer<00:00:57.100> during<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
was going to fare as a passer during the

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.130 
was going to fare as a passer during the
season<00:00:57.700> then<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.210> comes<00:00:58.360> out<00:00:58.570> in<00:00:58.690> week<00:00:58.809> one<00:00:59.020> and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
season then it comes out in week one and

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.750 
season then it comes out in week one and
just<00:00:59.230> lights<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.710> up<00:00:59.800> and<00:00:59.980> he<00:01:00.040> continued<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.610> do

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
just lights it up and he continued to do

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.400 
just lights it up and he continued to do
it<00:01:00.880> throughout<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.149> season<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:01.989> I<00:01:02.020> think<00:01:02.260> his

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
it throughout the season so I think his

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.380 
it throughout the season so I think his
passing<00:01:02.920> mechanics<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.520> fluid<00:01:03.910> release<00:01:04.210> I

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
passing mechanics is fluid release I

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.940 
passing mechanics is fluid release I
think<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.689> really<00:01:04.899> showed<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> lot<00:01:05.259> as<00:01:05.590> a

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
think you really showed a lot as a

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.680 
think you really showed a lot as a
passer<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:06.610> season<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.940> lot<00:01:07.090> more<00:01:07.299> than<00:01:07.450> teams

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
passer this season a lot more than teams

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.090 
passer this season a lot more than teams
had<00:01:07.810> expected<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.470> lot<00:01:08.650> more<00:01:08.710> than<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.070> expected

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
had expected a lot more than I expected

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.160 
had expected a lot more than I expected
you<00:01:10.000> look<00:01:10.150> at<00:01:10.270> what<00:01:10.360> he's<00:01:10.570> improving<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.080> do

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
you look at what he's improving I do

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.719 
you look at what he's improving I do
think<00:01:11.530> he<00:01:11.590> needs<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.860> learn<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.370> play<00:01:12.549> book

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
think he needs to learn it to play book

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:13.830 
think he needs to learn it to play book
I<00:01:12.850> think<00:01:13.030> he<00:01:13.090> needs<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.299> continue<00:01:13.570> learning

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
I think he needs to continue learning

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.300 
I think he needs to continue learning
and<00:01:14.290> what<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.620> means<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.890> lead<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.280> team

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
and what it means to lead that team

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.980 
and what it means to lead that team
obviously<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.120> defense<00:01:16.510> them<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.780> helping

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
obviously the defense them and helping

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.420 
obviously the defense them and helping
many<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:17.320> year<00:01:17.350> jon<00:01:17.710> beason<00:01:17.920> was<00:01:18.190> out<00:01:18.340> there

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
many this year jon beason was out there

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.490 
many this year jon beason was out there
