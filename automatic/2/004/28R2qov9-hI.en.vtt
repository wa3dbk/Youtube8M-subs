I mean that was a crappy header of

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.020 
I mean that was a crappy header of
course<00:04:37.040> some<00:04:37.160> people<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.550> was<00:04:37.669> good<00:04:37.790> cross

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
course some people so it was good cross

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.420

online and not getting a lot of 10 games
or<00:04:49.370> 20<00:04:49.550> games<00:04:49.940> seems<00:04:50.539> like<00:04:50.600> every<00:04:51.080> game<00:04:51.259> I<00:04:51.410> play

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
or 20 games seems like every game I play

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.230 
or 20 games seems like every game I play
there's<00:04:51.889> four<00:04:52.100> or<00:04:52.220> five<00:04:52.400> six<00:04:52.789> goals<00:04:53.000> in<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
there's four or five six goals in the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.270 
there's four or five six goals in the
game<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:54.259> don't<00:04:54.740> know<00:04:54.800> it's<00:04:54.949> just<00:04:55.070> too<00:04:55.250> much

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
game and I don't know it's just too much

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.830 
game and I don't know it's just too much
I<00:04:55.610> mean<00:04:55.729> it<00:04:55.820> seems<00:04:55.970> like<00:04:56.090> ultimate<00:04:56.509> team<00:04:56.630> might

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
I mean it seems like ultimate team might

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.110 
I mean it seems like ultimate team might
be<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.020> little<00:04:57.199> too<00:04:57.320> fast<00:04:57.740> online<00:04:58.039> still<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.820> do

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
be a little too fast online still I do

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.700 
be a little too fast online still I do
like<00:04:59.479> that<00:04:59.630> it's<00:04:59.690> faster<00:05:00.169> than<00:05:00.259> head<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.560> head

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
like that it's faster than head to head

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.740 
like that it's faster than head to head
seasons<00:05:00.919> or<00:05:01.310> better<00:05:01.639> than<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.360> know<00:05:02.449> just<00:05:02.479> the
