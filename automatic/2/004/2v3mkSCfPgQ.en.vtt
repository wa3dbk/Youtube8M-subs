00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
reason why I think it looks good to mix

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.010 
reason why I think it looks good to mix
brown<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.040> black<00:02:16.610> together<00:02:16.910> in<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.540> outfit

brown and black together in this outfit

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.550 
brown and black together in this outfit
is<00:02:18.170> because<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.860> shoe

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
is because of this shoe

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.140 
is because of this shoe
because<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:22.430> brown<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.910> black

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
because they have a brown and a black

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.870 
because they have a brown and a black
path<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> looks<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.070> kind<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.550> really

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
path so it looks like kind of really

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.420 
path so it looks like kind of really
