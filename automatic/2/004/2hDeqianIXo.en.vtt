hand<00:00:38.809> tool<00:00:39.019> process<00:00:39.530> is<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.710> lot<00:00:39.920> slower<00:00:40.280> and

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
hand tool process is a lot slower and

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.490 
hand tool process is a lot slower and
probably<00:00:41.330> takes<00:00:41.480> about<00:00:41.600> one<00:00:41.960> month<00:00:42.199> per

probably takes about one month per

probably takes about one month per
guitar<00:00:42.860> but<00:00:43.430> I<00:00:43.460> enjoy<00:00:43.820> almost<00:00:44.150> every<00:00:44.480> aspect

part<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.650> guitar<00:00:49.550> making<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.329> top<00:00:50.570> because

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
part of guitar making is the top because

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.200 
part of guitar making is the top because

I've<00:01:19.100> been<00:01:19.250> making<00:01:19.430> guitar<00:01:19.910> since<00:01:20.210> 2005<00:01:21.170> I

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
I've been making guitar since 2005 I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.940 
I've been making guitar since 2005 I
can't<00:01:22.580> really<00:01:22.940> remember<00:01:23.570> when<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.590> idea<00:01:24.890> came

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
can't really remember when the idea came

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.190 
can't really remember when the idea came
to<00:01:25.250> me<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.030> do<00:01:26.150> know<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.600> by<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.720> age<00:01:26.990> of

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
to me but I do know that by the age of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.120 
to me but I do know that by the age of
18<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.770> was<00:01:28.100> already<00:01:28.490> dreaming<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.240> it

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
18 I was already dreaming of it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.380 
18 I was already dreaming of it
I<00:01:31.570> think<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:32.750> using<00:01:32.960> hand<00:01:33.380> tools<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:34.729> just<00:01:35.150> it

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
I think that using hand tools is just it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.609 
I think that using hand tools is just it
just<00:01:35.840> feels<00:01:36.259> very<00:01:36.380> natural<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:37.250> me<00:01:38.619> it's

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
just feels very natural to me it's

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.090 
just feels very natural to me it's
something<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:41.619> never<00:01:42.619> seemed<00:01:42.920> like<00:01:43.009> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
something that never seemed like a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.310 
something that never seemed like a
question<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:44.270> was<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:44.600> always<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.170> solution

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
question it was just always the solution

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.530 
question it was just always the solution
I'm<00:01:45.920> going<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.369> build<00:01:46.520> guitars<00:01:46.700> using<00:01:47.299> hand

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
I'm going to build guitars using hand

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.800 
I'm going to build guitars using hand
tools<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.700> each<00:01:49.880> maker<00:01:50.210> finds<00:01:50.720> his

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
tools and you know each maker finds his

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.899 
tools and you know each maker finds his
own<00:01:50.930> process<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.830> there<00:01:52.130> are<00:01:52.220> many<00:01:52.490> ways<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
own process and there are many ways to

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.050 
own process and there are many ways to
build<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.240> guitar<00:01:53.630> as<00:01:53.899> there<00:01:54.320> are<00:01:54.380> luthiers<00:01:55.060> but

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
build a guitar as there are luthiers but

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.529 
build a guitar as there are luthiers but
focusing<00:01:56.690> my<00:01:56.899> process<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:58.009> hand<00:01:58.759> tools<00:01:59.090> has

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
focusing my process on hand tools has

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.380 
focusing my process on hand tools has
really<00:01:59.780> brought<00:01:59.960> me<00:01:59.990> closer<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.590> wood<00:02:00.950> and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
really brought me closer to wood and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.480 
really brought me closer to wood and
it's<00:02:02.390> really<00:02:03.319> been<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> very<00:02:03.619> important<00:02:04.250> part

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
it's really been a very important part

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.430 
it's really been a very important part
of<00:02:04.670> finding<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.030> deep<00:02:05.210> personal<00:02:05.690> satisfaction

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
of finding a deep personal satisfaction

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.650 
of finding a deep personal satisfaction
in<00:02:06.590> what<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.770> do

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
in what I do

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.180 
in what I do
guitar<00:02:08.660> makers<00:02:08.989> really<00:02:09.350> focus<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.100> are

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
guitar makers really focus on what are

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.610 
guitar makers really focus on what are
called<00:02:10.250> tone<00:02:10.729> woods<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.330> those<00:02:12.290> are<00:02:12.440> woods

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
called tone woods and those are woods

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.740 
called tone woods and those are woods
that<00:02:12.980> have<00:02:13.160> musical<00:02:13.730> properties<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.630> you

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that have musical properties and you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.350 
that have musical properties and you

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
kind of tap it you flex it you feel it

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.830 
kind of tap it you flex it you feel it
and<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.019> sounds<00:02:18.380> musical<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:19.400> varied<00:02:20.330> there

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
and it sounds musical it's varied there

range you can also look for wood that's

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.650 
range you can also look for wood that's
quick<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> fast<00:02:30.890> sound<00:02:31.400> or<00:02:31.790> that's<00:02:32.209> low
