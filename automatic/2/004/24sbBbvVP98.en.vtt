00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.649
 I had ended the relationship 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.080
 The practice of relationships reminds you 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.139
 when you talk about your story 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 is one of those things said we have to analyze the situation 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.210
 and was 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 the law establishes 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'll go another way 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.880
 let's go ahead 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.170
 therefore 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.060
 therefore 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.800
 the boy in love he is indeed never really disturbing if 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 I'm a personal friend 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 and intelligent 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.710
 but I think he may be surprised in January of this year they also get 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.510
 surprise 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.680
 unfortunately 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.880
 the first shift 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.190
 - I do not know if I understand 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.190
 In these cases, the relationship lasted three 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.740
 but with this sequence it is important to highlight cimed climbing okay no 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.440
 I'll explain anything 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 nor do I want them to go unpunished 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 alice looks like inside the state 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.490
 It's strange, it's so 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.850
 Who bought and whom does love need? 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 following day 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 Besides that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 I just take 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 inside what was my grandfather 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 if I knew he was with me 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.920
 during the three years in which I tried to stay with him the perceived vestas 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.619
 we are here to put these people have fainted several people if 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.179
 deliver a child dies 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.059
 and they are not aware of how much she said debora diniz 2007 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:13.749
 ef 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.400
 I thought it was time to return the essential is that there is nothing to 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:21.999
 add troop training in urban areas and the following year 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.529
 in season parquier 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.819
 for it will need to receive someone crying without stopping the sentimental side 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.099
 back to the good normative act 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.469
 it's a success story 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 new sanctions 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.099
 it's about the saints 25 years minutes 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.290
 at the same time 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 to talk to me 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.439
 Philip 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.279
 now I said 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.469
 call me 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.979
 nobody 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.699
 Who also got along? 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.289
 but that's another way 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.059
 the bragantino 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.649
 in that sense people all over the island 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:14.239
 I want to give the best of ourselves time, not even how I would 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.759
 plantar says it was true 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.479
 for he did not know how 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:23.529
 you may be aware of the stars - it is also close to 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.529
 talk talk to me anytime 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.310
 and so it was that I really had absolute 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.539
 and complete certainties 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.069
 but the celestial selection 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.979
 what are they 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.529
 I do not think a part of the relationship does not work out 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.869
 it is 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 trying to design a good late cycle 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.839
 I think half the men who is also what the customer wants even though I 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.079
 I thought it came 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.079
 in this respect the medicines 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.669
 and I would love to be 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:03.969
 at 10 minutes
