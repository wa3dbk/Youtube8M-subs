because as we continue on and get new
warmers<00:01:49.950> they're<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.820> making<00:01:51.360> plug-ins

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
warmers they're actually making plug-ins

for a lot of the large warmers so you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.399 
for a lot of the large warmers so you
just<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
just want to make sure that you have the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.160 
just want to make sure that you have the
right<00:01:55.590> size<00:01:56.250> warmer<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> put<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> price

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
right size warmer then you put the price

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
right size warmer then you put the price
and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> subtotal<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and then you do a subtotal now the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.190 
and then you do a subtotal now the
subtotal<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:00.990> everything<00:02:01.500> listed<00:02:01.920> above

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
subtotal is everything listed above

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.980 
subtotal is everything listed above
shipping<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> 10%<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> total<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
shipping is 10% of the total of the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.369 
shipping is 10% of the total of the
subtotal<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.940> think<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.869> actually<00:02:10.050> pretty

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
subtotal so I think it's actually pretty

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.030 
subtotal so I think it's actually pretty
easy<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.099> because<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.720> was<00:02:12.959> $80

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
easy to do that because if this was $80

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520 
easy to do that because if this was $80
the<00:02:14.340> shipping<00:02:14.580> would<00:02:14.820> be<00:02:14.940> $8<00:02:15.540> because<00:02:16.350> it's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the shipping would be $8 because it's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.240 
the shipping would be $8 because it's
$75<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.700> shipping<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.180> 750<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:20.010> actually

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
$75 the shipping is 750 so it's actually

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.480 
$75 the shipping is 750 so it's actually
pretty<00:02:20.580> easy<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.120> calculate<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:22.020> head

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
pretty easy to calculate in your head

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.790 
pretty easy to calculate in your head
based<00:02:23.490> on<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.970> number<00:02:24.270> if<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.570> was<00:02:24.690> 99<00:02:25.290> dollars

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
based on the number if it was 99 dollars

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
based on the number if it was 99 dollars
it<00:02:26.100> would<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.400> nine<00:02:26.580> dollars<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.210> ninety

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it would be nine dollars and ninety

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.810 
it would be nine dollars and ninety
cents<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.710> hopefully<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.190> makes<00:02:29.220> sense<00:02:29.670> but

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
cents so hopefully that makes sense but

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.990 
cents so hopefully that makes sense but
it<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:29.970> ten<00:02:30.360> percent<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.860> subtotal<00:02:32.460> now

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it is ten percent of the subtotal now

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.760 
it is ten percent of the subtotal now
remember<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> party

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
remember if this is a party

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.720 
remember if this is a party
and<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.430> total<00:02:36.000> orders<00:02:36.770> combined<00:02:37.770> are<00:02:38.100> more

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and the total orders combined are more

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.400 
and the total orders combined are more
than<00:02:38.850> one<00:02:39.000> hundred<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.330> fifty<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.900> nobody

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
than one hundred and fifty that nobody

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.970 
than one hundred and fifty that nobody
needs<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.800> pay<00:02:41.070> shipping<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.620> order

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
needs to pay shipping and if this order

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.010 
needs to pay shipping and if this order
was<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.160> hundred<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.640> fifty<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:44.940> more<00:02:45.390> then

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
was a hundred and fifty or more then

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.380 
was a hundred and fifty or more then
this<00:02:46.260> order<00:02:46.590> would<00:02:46.709> not<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.610> charged<00:02:48.090> for

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this order would not be charged for

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.949 
this order would not be charged for
shipping<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.400> next<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:50.910> would<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.120> sales<00:02:51.540> tax

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
shipping the next one would be sales tax

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.050 
shipping the next one would be sales tax
now<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.800> are<00:02:52.950> gonna<00:02:53.100> pay<00:02:53.340> shipping<00:02:53.640> maybe

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
now if they are gonna pay shipping maybe

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.460 
now if they are gonna pay shipping maybe
they're<00:02:54.300> having<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.690> direct<00:02:55.050> shipped<00:02:55.320> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
they're having it direct shipped to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.610 
they're having it direct shipped to
their<00:02:55.620> home<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.270> charge<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.989> shipping<00:02:58.020> or

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
their home you do charge the shipping or

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.120 
their home you do charge the shipping or
you<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:59.010> tax<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.700> shipping<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.810> it'd<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.130> $75

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
you do tax the shipping so it'd be $75

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.810 
you do tax the shipping so it'd be $75
plus<00:03:02.400> seven<00:03:02.760> dollars<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.209> fifty<00:03:03.300> cents<00:03:03.750> times

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
plus seven dollars and fifty cents times

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.170 
plus seven dollars and fifty cents times
the<00:03:05.820> percentage<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:07.080> state<00:03:08.180> charges

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the percentage that your state charges

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.920 
the percentage that your state charges
so<00:03:10.020> main<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.800> five<00:03:11.040> percent<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.150> five<00:03:12.660> percent

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
so main is five percent so five percent

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.979 
so main is five percent so five percent
of<00:03:13.380> seventy<00:03:13.920> five<00:03:14.100> plus<00:03:14.760> seven<00:03:14.940> fifty<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.660> four

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
of seventy five plus seven fifty is four

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.440 
of seventy five plus seven fifty is four
dollars<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.470> thirteen<00:03:16.860> cents<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.090> add

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
dollars and thirteen cents so now I add

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.120 
dollars and thirteen cents so now I add
