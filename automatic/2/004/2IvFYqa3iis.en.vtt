00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:22.419 
got a very compact ground block updated
detector<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:15.430> well<00:00:18.970> it<00:00:19.970> works<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:20.720> it's<00:00:21.470> it's

too white it's for high and yeah it's 41

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.530 
too white it's for high and yeah it's 41
it's<00:00:29.119> crazy<00:00:30.109> 8<00:00:30.410> compact<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.220> it<00:00:31.730> doesn't<00:00:32.480> take

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's crazy 8 compact and it doesn't take

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.260 
it's crazy 8 compact and it doesn't take
a<00:00:32.960> lot<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.200> resources<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:37.160> app<00:00:37.310> so<00:00:37.610> if<00:00:38.030> you

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
a lot of resources and the app so if you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.080 
a lot of resources and the app so if you
if<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:38.840> are<00:00:38.870> wondering<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:39.710> if<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.010> count<00:00:40.280> if

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
if you are wondering so if you count if

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.250 
if you are wondering so if you count if
you<00:00:41.270> count<00:00:41.480> it<00:00:41.660> one<00:00:42.050> two<00:00:42.470> three<00:00:42.500> four<00:00:42.890> but<00:00:44.260> yeah

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
you count it one two three four but yeah

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.120 
you count it one two three four but yeah
there's<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:45.890> book<00:00:46.130> here<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.020> if<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:48.800> also

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
there's this book here and if it also

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.920 
there's this book here and if it also
should<00:00:49.340> count<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:50.330> could<00:00:50.480> just<00:00:50.660> do<00:00:50.900> this

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
should count but you could just do this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.560 
should count but you could just do this
and<00:00:51.940> now<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.440> now<00:00:54.440> it's<00:00:54.560> for<00:00:55.070> high<00:00:55.570> instead

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
and now it's now it's for high instead

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.210 
and now it's now it's for high instead
of<00:00:56.690> being<00:00:56.900> five<00:00:57.170> high<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.360> yep<00:00:59.360> it's<00:00:59.630> pretty

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
of being five high and yep it's pretty

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.649 
of being five high and yep it's pretty
compact<00:01:01.220> and<00:01:01.490> it<00:01:02.450> does<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.960> its<00:01:03.380> job<00:01:04.449> but<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
compact and it does it its job but the

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.380 
compact and it does it its job but the
only<00:01:05.810> problem<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.460> not<00:01:07.729> fast<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
only problem is it's not fast with the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.719 
only problem is it's not fast with the
wall<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.229> yeah<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:10.130> will<00:01:10.280> need<00:01:10.399> to<00:01:10.460> do

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
wall so yeah you will need to do

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.029 
wall so yeah you will need to do
something<00:01:11.000> like<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.500> will<00:01:12.590> scour

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
something like this and you will scour

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:23.620 
something like this and you will scour
the<00:01:13.070> sub<00:01:13.460> also<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:15.609> yep<00:01:16.609> it<00:01:16.939> works<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:22.329> it<00:01:23.329> is

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
the sub also but yep it works and it is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.510 
the sub also but yep it works and it is
actually<00:01:24.109> very<00:01:24.799> easy<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.759> do<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:27.520> well

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
actually very easy to do it and well

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
switch over to the second side and yep

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.849 
switch over to the second side and yep
it's<00:01:47.780> pretty<00:01:48.729> compact<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.479> does<00:01:50.869> its<00:01:51.109> job

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's pretty compact and it does its job

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.109 
it's pretty compact and it does its job
yeah<00:01:52.729> guys<00:01:52.969> so<00:01:53.389> i<00:01:53.659> know<00:01:54.229> there's<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:55.119> design

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
yeah guys so i know there's a design

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.419 
yeah guys so i know there's a design
that<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.329> actually<00:01:56.959> smaller<00:01:57.139> than<00:01:57.499> this<00:01:57.889> but

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
that is actually smaller than this but

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.929 
that is actually smaller than this but
it<00:01:58.759> takes<00:01:59.060> more<00:01:59.240> resources<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.759> yet<00:02:01.759> this

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
it takes more resources and yet this

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.230 
it takes more resources and yet this
just<00:02:02.329> 62<00:02:02.959> sticky<00:02:03.889> pistons

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
just 62 sticky pistons

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.510 
just 62 sticky pistons

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
well click on the torches I I will not

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.250 
well click on the torches I I will not
count<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.970> torch<00:02:11.270> because<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.020> also

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
count this torch because you can also

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.300 
count this torch because you can also
just<00:02:12.650> use<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:13.160> lever<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.980> so
