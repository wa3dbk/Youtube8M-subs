00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.850 
screen system and I talked to the guys
who<00:04:33.849> built<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.510> now<00:04:35.289> we<00:04:35.349> are<00:04:35.800> using

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
who built it and now we are using

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.790 
who built it and now we are using
Android<00:04:36.849> based<00:04:37.260> he<00:04:38.260> said<00:04:38.470> you're<00:04:38.620> not<00:04:38.680> gonna

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
Android based he said you're not gonna

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.500 
Android based he said you're not gonna
see<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.070> lot<00:04:39.130> of<00:04:39.430> differences<00:04:39.910> from<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.360> end

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
see a lot of differences from the end

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.510 
see a lot of differences from the end
user<00:04:40.720> but<00:04:41.560> most<00:04:41.830> likely<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:42.310> gonna<00:04:42.370> be

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
user but most likely it's gonna be

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.100 
user but most likely it's gonna be
faster<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.240> it's<00:04:43.389> gonna<00:04:43.479> interact<00:04:43.900> with

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
faster and it's gonna interact with

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.200 
faster and it's gonna interact with
their<00:04:44.260> phones<00:04:44.560> our<00:04:44.979> Android<00:04:45.310> phones<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.789> our

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.159 
and that made sense to me but I'm not

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.459 
and that made sense to me but I'm not
opposed<00:07:30.969> asking<00:07:31.569> the<00:07:31.659> hard<00:07:31.810> questions<00:07:31.930> and

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:32.469 
opposed asking the hard questions and

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:34.290 
opposed asking the hard questions and
getting<00:07:32.680> to<00:07:32.770> the<00:07:32.860> truth<00:07:33.039> I'm<00:07:33.639> just<00:07:33.819> kidding

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.529 
getting to the truth I'm just kidding
so<00:07:34.629> that<00:07:35.349> pretty<00:07:35.680> much<00:07:35.860> finishes<00:07:36.490> off<00:07:36.969> my<00:07:37.300> walk

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:37.539 
so that pretty much finishes off my walk

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.679 
so that pretty much finishes off my walk
around<00:07:38.310> 3.5<00:07:39.310> liter<00:07:39.580> engine<00:07:40.000> we<00:07:40.180> don't<00:07:40.509> know

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:42.069 
any other specs so I'm kind of leaving

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:44.790
