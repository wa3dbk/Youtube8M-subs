00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.830 
to do a video about it so oh yeah you
know<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> beginner<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.740> guys<00:00:29.599> it's<00:00:30.599> pretty

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
know do a beginner you guys it's pretty

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.250 
know do a beginner you guys it's pretty
cool<00:00:31.080> size<00:00:31.679> comparison<00:00:32.630> with<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.930> minifigure

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
cool size comparison with a minifigure

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.630 
cool size comparison with a minifigure
so<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.530> see<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:38.010> minifigure

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so as you can see it's about minifigure

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.610 
so as you can see it's about minifigure
scale<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> pretty<00:00:41.760> cool<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.410> was<00:00:43.530> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
scale so pretty cool I think I was like

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
scale so pretty cool I think I was like
a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:43.800> laser<00:00:44.070> gun<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.640> front<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:47.030> two

a little laser gun in the front and two
of<00:00:48.149> these<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> back<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.170> three<00:00:49.739> thrusters

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
of these in the back and three thrusters

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.229 
of these in the back and three thrusters
and<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> cluster<00:00:51.270> actually<00:00:52.170> um<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.430> serve

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and this cluster actually um I serve

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.330 
and this cluster actually um I serve
eight<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:55.289> um<00:00:57.050> little<00:00:58.050> play<00:00:58.289> future<00:00:58.800> but

I'll<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.020> eventually<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.649> then

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
I'll get to that eventually and then

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.880 
I'll get to that eventually and then
this<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.399> droid<00:01:02.760> head<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> turntable

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.219 

and<00:01:08.119> it's<00:01:09.119> pretty<00:01:09.360> cool<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.930> obviously

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and it's pretty cool and then obviously

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.700 
and it's pretty cool and then obviously
the<00:01:10.799> cockpit<00:01:11.340> open<00:01:12.049> there's<00:01:13.049> no<00:01:13.170> room<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the cockpit open there's no room for a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.510 
the cockpit open there's no room for a
minifigure<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.630> that's<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
minifigure and that's where so the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.789 
minifigure and that's where so the
little<00:01:17.759> Play<00:01:17.880> feature<00:01:18.090> happens<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
little Play feature happens we do is you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.390 
little Play feature happens we do is you

press in this this dr. and it activates

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.600 
press in this this dr. and it activates
that<00:01:29.820> turn<00:01:30.329> clip

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that turn clip

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.840 
that turn clip
so<00:01:33.680> as<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.250> pretty<00:01:35.280> cool<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> never

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so as you see it's pretty cool I never

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.000 
so as you see it's pretty cool I never
keep<00:01:36.210> track<00:01:36.510> of<00:01:36.660> how<00:01:36.810> many<00:01:36.870> bricks<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.560> use<00:01:37.770> on

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
keep track of how many bricks I use on

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.420 
keep track of how many bricks I use on
these<00:01:38.220> creations<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.680> my<00:01:40.920> guess<00:01:41.190> would<00:01:41.370> be

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
these creations so but my guess would be

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.780 
these creations so but my guess would be
maybe<00:01:42.170> under<00:01:43.170> 100<00:01:43.620> maybe<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:44.130> 70<00:01:44.610> or

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
maybe under 100 maybe like 70 or

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.820 
maybe under 100 maybe like 70 or
something<00:01:44.970> maybe<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.510> little<00:01:45.540> more<00:01:45.750> well<00:01:46.740> I'm

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
something maybe a little more well I'm

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.320 
something maybe a little more well I'm
