picking up hot pans you know this is a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.860 
picking up hot pans you know this is a
vinyl<00:02:15.130> material<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.420> does<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
vinyl material so it does have the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.760 
vinyl material so it does have the
ability<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.410> melt<00:02:18.060> actually<00:02:19.060> use<00:02:19.180> them<00:02:19.770> quite

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
ability to melt actually use them quite

changing irrigation when the pipes are
basically<00:02:25.270> frozen<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:26.020> kind<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.709> that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
basically frozen it's kind of like that

frozen irrigation pipe you're gonna want

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.100 
frozen irrigation pipe you're gonna want
gloves<00:02:38.080> on<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:39.270> although<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.450> didn't<00:02:40.840> get<00:02:40.930> any

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
gloves on and although I didn't get any

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.620 
gloves on and although I didn't get any
scars<00:02:41.440> really<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:43.150> know<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.390> liner

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
scars really for that you know the liner

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.330 
scars really for that you know the liner
in<00:02:43.900> here<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.200> think<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.650> mostly<00:02:44.920> from<00:02:45.130> fire

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
in here I think is mostly from fire

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.220 
in here I think is mostly from fire
craft<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:46.180> over<00:02:46.390> two<00:02:46.570> years<00:02:46.840> they've<00:02:47.050> just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
craft in over two years they've just

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.460 
craft in over two years they've just
sort<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.530> worn<00:02:47.739> through<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.340> basically<00:02:49.470> see

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
sort of worn through and basically see

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.710 
sort of worn through and basically see
more<00:02:50.709> than<00:02:50.860> their<00:02:51.040> usefulness<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.060> went<00:02:52.660> to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
more than their usefulness so I went to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.380 
more than their usefulness so I went to
replace<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:54.310> basically<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:56.130> same

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
replace them with basically the same

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.810 
replace them with basically the same
all-weather<00:02:58.390> glove<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.620> originals<00:03:00.220> as

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
all-weather glove but the originals as

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.090 
all-weather glove but the originals as
soon<00:03:01.030> as<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.150> get<00:03:01.300> these<00:03:01.480> off<00:03:01.750> here<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.230> will<00:03:02.950> show

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
soon as I get these off here I will show

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.759 
soon as I get these off here I will show
you<00:03:03.190> them<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:04.870> are<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.019> little<00:03:05.530> bit<00:03:05.739> more

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
you them and they are a little bit more

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.490 
you them and they are a little bit more
neoprene<00:03:06.519> type<00:03:06.910> material<00:03:07.450> they<00:03:07.870> are<00:03:08.049> thicker

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
neoprene type material they are thicker

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.449 
neoprene type material they are thicker
and<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:10.570> are<00:03:10.810> softer<00:03:11.440> on<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.739> inside<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.130> will

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
and they are softer on the inside I will

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.080 
and they are softer on the inside I will
say<00:03:12.670> they've<00:03:13.450> got<00:03:13.660> more<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.090> Polartec

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
say they've got more of the Polartec

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.509 
say they've got more of the Polartec
lining<00:03:16.810> which<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.739> helps<00:03:18.190> with<00:03:18.459> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
lining which really helps with the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.250 
lining which really helps with the
wicking<00:03:19.030> when<00:03:19.420> you're<00:03:19.510> doing<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.780> lot<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.959> stuff

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
wicking when you're doing a lot of stuff

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.080 
wicking when you're doing a lot of stuff
but<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.870> get<00:03:22.989> these<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:23.880> because<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
but they get these on here because of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.330 
but they get these on here because of
the<00:03:25.180> thicker<00:03:25.390> material<00:03:25.709> although<00:03:26.709> these<00:03:27.040> are

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the thicker material although these are

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.270 
the thicker material although these are
just<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.239> waterproof<00:03:28.540> just<00:03:28.989> wind<00:03:29.320> proof<00:03:29.620> keep

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
just as waterproof just wind proof keep

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.610 
just as waterproof just wind proof keep

your hands nice and warm you start
losing<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.190> dexterity<00:03:33.910> now<00:03:34.420> these<00:03:34.690> are

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
losing that dexterity now these are

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.500 
losing that dexterity now these are
about<00:03:35.650> where<00:03:36.100> most<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:36.790> my<00:03:36.850> winter<00:03:37.150> gloves

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
about where most of my winter gloves

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.199 
about where most of my winter gloves
were<00:03:37.840> previously<00:03:38.709> they<00:03:39.640> are<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.820> little<00:03:40.060> bit

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
were previously they are a little bit

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.600

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.880 
stuff weather shield tri-lamb
it's<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.510> Hyperlight<00:04:14.079> is<00:04:14.379> quite<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.709> bit

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
it's just the Hyperlight is quite a bit

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.770 
it's just the Hyperlight is quite a bit
thinner<00:04:15.189> and<00:04:15.760> unfortunately<00:04:16.389> they<00:04:16.570> didn't

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
thinner and unfortunately they didn't

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.370 
thinner and unfortunately they didn't
have<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.139> in<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.289> Hyperlight<00:04:17.829> that<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.690> think

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
have it in the Hyperlight that I think

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.900 
have it in the Hyperlight that I think
the<00:04:20.470> only<00:04:20.590> hyper<00:04:20.949> light<00:04:21.190> they<00:04:21.340> have<00:04:21.459> locally

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
the only hyper light they have locally

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.060 
the only hyper light they have locally
here<00:04:22.150> was<00:04:22.449> they<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.050> new<00:04:23.229> touch<00:04:23.560> version

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
here was they have a new touch version

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.969 
here was they have a new touch version
where<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.210> pads<00:04:25.479> are<00:04:25.930> able<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.350> activate<00:04:26.770> like

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
where the pads are able to activate like

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.760 
where the pads are able to activate like
a<00:04:27.009> touchpad<00:04:28.139> well<00:04:29.139> I<00:04:29.169> thought<00:04:29.380> maybe<00:04:29.530> my

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
a touchpad well I thought maybe my

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.230 
a touchpad well I thought maybe my
tablet<00:04:30.130> was<00:04:30.250> charged<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.699> not<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:30.880> was<00:04:31.090> going

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
tablet was charged it's not I was going

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.960 
tablet was charged it's not I was going
to<00:04:31.300> demonstrate<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.340> hyper<00:04:33.639> light<00:04:33.940> I

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
to demonstrate the the hyper light I

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.719 
to demonstrate the the hyper light I
could<00:04:34.240> find<00:04:34.449> locally<00:04:34.870> here<00:04:35.169> is<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.919> new<00:04:36.220> touch

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
could find locally here is a new touch

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.120 
could find locally here is a new touch
pad<00:04:37.030> one<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.539> all<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.840> finger<00:04:38.110> tabs<00:04:38.410> work

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
pad one that all the finger tabs work

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.550 
pad one that all the finger tabs work
with<00:04:39.430> your<00:04:39.820> touch<00:04:40.090> screens<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.169> will<00:04:41.350> say

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
with your touch screens and I will say

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.469 
with your touch screens and I will say
that<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.009> hyper<00:04:42.370> lights<00:04:42.699> worked<00:04:43.120> with<00:04:43.330> my

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
that the hyper lights worked with my

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.510 
that the hyper lights worked with my
cell<00:04:43.780> phone<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:44.289> never<00:04:45.130> had<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.340> problem

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
cell phone I never had a problem

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.610 
cell phone I never had a problem
accessing<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.539> cell<00:04:46.780> phone<00:04:47.050> with<00:04:47.470> these

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
accessing the cell phone with these

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.020 
accessing the cell phone with these
gloves<00:04:47.889> on<00:04:48.160> even<00:04:48.400> though<00:04:48.490> they're<00:04:48.669> not<00:04:48.699> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
gloves on even though they're not the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.230 
gloves on even though they're not the
touch<00:04:49.270> version<00:04:49.570> I<00:04:50.530> may<00:04:50.979> probably<00:04:51.520> go<00:04:51.669> back<00:04:51.910> and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
touch version I may probably go back and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.540 
touch version I may probably go back and
buy<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.479> touch<00:04:52.810> version<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:53.860> but<00:04:54.009> because<00:04:54.280> I

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
buy the touch version so but because I

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.670 
buy the touch version so but because I
much<00:04:55.120> prefer<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.630> thinner<00:04:55.900> hyper<00:04:56.349> light

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
much prefer the thinner hyper light

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.089 
much prefer the thinner hyper light
these<00:04:57.310> are<00:04:57.669> good<00:04:58.300> gloves<00:04:58.690> but<00:04:59.289> they're<00:04:59.650> to<00:05:00.009> the

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
these are good gloves but they're to the

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.320 
these are good gloves but they're to the
point<00:05:00.370> where<00:05:00.580> you<00:05:00.759> start<00:05:00.820> loosing<00:05:01.300> that

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
point where you start loosing that

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.650 
point where you start loosing that
dexterity<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:03.039> they're<00:05:03.699> not<00:05:03.820> as<00:05:04.060> good<00:05:04.120> as<00:05:04.419> the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
dexterity and they're not as good as the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.170 
dexterity and they're not as good as the
you<00:05:05.289> know<00:05:05.440> huge<00:05:05.919> over<00:05:06.250> glove<00:05:06.520> mittens<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.030> I

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
you know huge over glove mittens that I

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.290 
you know huge over glove mittens that I
have<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.620> basically<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.669> want<00:05:09.880> something

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
have so basically you want something

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.150 
have so basically you want something

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
thin waterproof that you can wear that

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.710 
thin waterproof that you can wear that
you<00:05:12.250> can<00:05:12.400> use<00:05:12.580> by<00:05:12.789> putting<00:05:13.150> up<00:05:13.240> camp<00:05:13.509> and

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
you can use by putting up camp and

camp without wearing your really heavy

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.350 
camp without wearing your really heavy
gloves<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.770> this<00:05:18.400> sort<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.729> is<00:05:18.909> kind<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.210> in

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
gloves and this sort of is kind of in

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.149 
gloves and this sort of is kind of in
the<00:05:19.449> middle<00:05:19.659> where<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.470> almost<00:05:20.860> approaching

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
the middle where it's almost approaching

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.820 
the middle where it's almost approaching
that<00:05:21.550> too<00:05:22.389> thick<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.930> glove<00:05:23.199> to<00:05:23.409> really<00:05:23.620> do

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
that too thick of a glove to really do

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.560 
that too thick of a glove to really do
much<00:05:24.039> other<00:05:24.280> than<00:05:24.789> I<00:05:25.090> mean<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.419> can

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
much other than I mean you can

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.969 
much other than I mean you can
definitely<00:05:25.720> wear<00:05:25.960> these<00:05:26.229> in<00:05:26.440> ski<00:05:26.680> with<00:05:26.860> these

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
definitely wear these in ski with these

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.670 
definitely wear these in ski with these
and<00:05:27.190> everything<00:05:27.460> else<00:05:27.990> but<00:05:28.990> it<00:05:29.229> just<00:05:29.470> doesn't

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
and everything else but it just doesn't

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.170 
and everything else but it just doesn't
fill<00:05:29.949> that<00:05:30.099> niche<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.729> Hyperlight

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
fill that niche that the Hyperlight

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.779 
fill that niche that the Hyperlight
versions<00:05:31.720> did<00:05:31.990> so<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.949> recommend<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.580> hyper

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789

comfortable<00:05:52.240> I<00:05:52.449> sacrificed<00:05:53.409> them<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.770> didn't

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
comfortable I sacrificed them and didn't

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.520 
comfortable I sacrificed them and didn't
change<00:05:54.130> out<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.490> gloves<00:05:54.729> like<00:05:54.849> I<00:05:54.970> should<00:05:55.180> have

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
change out the gloves like I should have

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.460 
change out the gloves like I should have
and<00:05:56.940> this<00:05:57.940> is<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.180> result<00:05:58.570> so<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:59.050> will

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
and this is the result so I will

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.050 
and this is the result so I will
probably<00:05:59.650> be<00:05:59.979> taking<00:06:00.310> these<00:06:00.430> back<00:06:00.669> and

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
probably be taking these back and

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.149 
probably be taking these back and
picking<00:06:01.570> up<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.780> Hyperlight<00:06:02.199> versions<00:06:02.770> if<00:06:03.009> I

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
picking up the Hyperlight versions if I

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.350 
picking up the Hyperlight versions if I
can<00:06:03.310> only<00:06:03.430> find<00:06:03.639> the<00:06:03.789> touch<00:06:04.000> that<00:06:04.270> I'll

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
can only find the touch that I'll

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.300 
can only find the touch that I'll
probably<00:06:04.509> be<00:06:04.810> getting<00:06:05.050> those<00:06:05.409> but<00:06:06.039> I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
probably be getting those but I

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.860 
probably be getting those but I
recommend<00:06:06.610> you<00:06:06.759> looking<00:06:07.090> into<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.479> Cirrus

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
recommend you looking into the Cirrus

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.560 
recommend you looking into the Cirrus
all-weather<00:06:08.800> versions<00:06:09.400> there's<00:06:10.000> a<00:06:10.120> couple

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
all-weather versions there's a couple

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.439 
all-weather versions there's a couple
ones<00:06:10.900> they<00:06:11.110> do<00:06:11.169> have<00:06:11.440> one<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:11.800> is<00:06:11.949> fireproof

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
ones they do have one that is fireproof

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.629 
ones they do have one that is fireproof
I<00:06:13.449> have<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.810> feeling<00:06:14.199> it's<00:06:14.409> it'll<00:06:15.099> still<00:06:15.340> melt

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
I have a feeling it's it'll still melt

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.790 
I have a feeling it's it'll still melt
but<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.090> probably<00:06:16.240> won't<00:06:16.479> catch<00:06:16.810> fire<00:06:16.840> like<00:06:17.770> a

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
but it probably won't catch fire like a

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.279 
but it probably won't catch fire like a
lot<00:06:18.009> of<00:06:18.099> the<00:06:18.159> new<00:06:18.280> fireproof<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.990> know<00:06:20.080> mod

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
lot of the new fireproof you know mod

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.890 
lot of the new fireproof you know mod
acrylic<00:06:20.770> things<00:06:21.159> are<00:06:21.400> and<00:06:22.150> I<00:06:22.240> probably<00:06:22.510> won't

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
acrylic things are and I probably won't

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.080 
acrylic things are and I probably won't
get<00:06:23.680> those<00:06:23.919> or<00:06:24.159> recommend<00:06:24.639> those<00:06:24.789> because<00:06:25.029> I

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
get those or recommend those because I

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.800 
get those or recommend those because I
have<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.240> feeling

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
have a feeling

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.570 
have a feeling
that<00:06:26.230> they<00:06:26.380> would<00:06:26.560> still<00:06:26.770> melt<00:06:27.070> they're<00:06:27.400> not

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
that they would still melt they're not

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.180 
that they would still melt they're not
fireproof<00:06:28.180> they<00:06:28.780> just<00:06:28.990> won't<00:06:29.200> catch<00:06:29.560> fire<00:06:29.889> and

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
fireproof they just won't catch fire and

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.250 
fireproof they just won't catch fire and
melt<00:06:30.700> on<00:06:30.940> your<00:06:31.090> hand<00:06:31.389> it's<00:06:31.690> basically<00:06:32.110> all

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
melt on your hand it's basically all

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.680 
melt on your hand it's basically all
they<00:06:32.410> will<00:06:32.560> do<00:06:32.980> so<00:06:33.340> there<00:06:34.060> are<00:06:34.210> other<00:06:34.419> versions

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
they will do so there are other versions

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.260 
they will do so there are other versions
out<00:06:35.050> there<00:06:35.080> but<00:06:35.590> I<00:06:35.830> recommend<00:06:36.400> if<00:06:36.910> you<00:06:37.030> can<00:06:37.060> get

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
out there but I recommend if you can get

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.730 
out there but I recommend if you can get
the<00:06:37.360> all-weather<00:06:37.660> hyper<00:06:38.020> lights<00:06:38.320> whether<00:06:38.590> it

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
the all-weather hyper lights whether it

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.350 
the all-weather hyper lights whether it
be<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:38.980> touch<00:06:39.160> version<00:06:39.370> or<00:06:39.639> not<00:06:39.790> they're

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
be the touch version or not they're

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.410 
be the touch version or not they're
definitely<00:06:40.810> a<00:06:40.990> must
