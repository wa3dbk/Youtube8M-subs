00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.990
 during breakfast but also in the nice word iodized salt i5 it takes 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.949
 know that it's very good for you 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.499
 as perfectly fine then the day you see a radio host to whom 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.429
 you ask the direct question of whether it will study for our embassies 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.269
 the paf tells what happened in my life 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.400
 flows are strong with my wife 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.759
 the attitude of the representatives 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.650
 the map 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.569
 alicia keys about tickets for tibet 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.080
 but expensive has a lot of success 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.699
 oh yes the plane shot points or sms 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's because it happens and it can be nice 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 wear a priori as you are fan of bixi xiie xive of djenin scale and 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.300
 sanitation and that part of shaded and light 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.590
 and we should be able to get along with you 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.680
 percent since I'm already a fan of the xxx 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.140
 I take nothing away from his followers in France next to real stars 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.310
 of quality in the usa the title of johnny mitchell who could who 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.910
 returns by reinterpreting is by the way all his repertoire and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.790
 is learned 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.390
 any new dimension from elsewhere 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.520
 good kid is not there talking about the American qualifier we're here 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.639
 to talk about French music that you represent brilliantly analysts 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:04.589
 the mjc 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.870
 it can be said unfortunately that in Kosovo and the general public 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.310
 little news that is not yet very well known so so the question which 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.380
 wins 6 if you where do you come from an eclipse both players 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.530
 the magic comes already from communication so far the third 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 set local actions 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 I want here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.260
 this is our happiness because we must know that the right now you are 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.560
 until the early April menu kill him in them 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.590
 the liner of juliette roméo and juliette and if you will attack with the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.149
 first on September 30th so we have time to note remains of 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.830
 juliette to finish here it is finished in April the npa consists of 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.670
 the second musical is the first that agree 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.740
 but then it's working on his client because technician 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.929
 ok I played five 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.189
 and then you're going to attack so dracula the new musical kamel 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.060
 ouali here to interpret them in russia 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.860
 okay who lucien aubey first first 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 must set the scene dracula what will be what it will be history 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.900
 so after the press fit 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.760
 a festive canal brings a lot of things to the merger this 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.200
 show what the two main characters are not for the first 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.369
 times the singers but the dancers 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.559
 so sir dracula interpreted by helene necessary and even dared a 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.969
 minor so without her lover interpreted by natalie choquette 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.329
 this solid in this nathalie role will also play comedy 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.969
 and around this main character we find a troupe of seven singers 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.749
 which I'm part of 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.810
 my role is a unanimous decision of 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.289
 these main female characters 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.180
 Okay, and you're the one who opens the ball with him 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.900
 the first song extracted from the album foot that is coming for the April 4 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.589
 I believe 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.389
 for the 11th of april for the 11th of april you are always the ball with one two three 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.819
 a song that we must 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.189
 the man mademoiselle ayache me I do not do anything I repeat to the service 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.599
 so I imagine vote was killed anyway 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.489
 the youngest a few years ago when we consider bussières to a 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.460
 started at the magical DJ of the café-theater 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.730
 to ten kilometers to tell you with a rape with the songs in a certain 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.260
 comfort 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.629
 I know it's not the only one on this project and that moreover 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.629
 I have already written for the moment the missiles and other disaster 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.209
 that I will not know his first single these terms so little 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.790
 what is this unexpected but he sees the arrival of genealogists 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.280
 then you're not shy but here 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.040
 not at all 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.709
 I imagine because to ride like that every night 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.900
 on stage in front of thousands of spectators 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.210
 so dracula it will be on the 30th of September with them I quote that is indicated on the 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.339
 official website a great world premiere 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.369
 % and it's a little foolish to have opened the ball like this with the 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:34.379
 the first single 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.700
 the erp at the beginning when one lacks sleep says yes it made me a little 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.189
 task 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.689
 british airways 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.409
 for them it's a big pressure and then no it would be great 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.660
 launch of the farther fathers 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.549
 but reported and really good with him 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.639
 he is there 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.399
 what do these wishes of happiness mean 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.050
 rehearsals began at the imaginary museum 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.130
 for rehearsals started this summer 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.230
 strictly speaking, all that is consistent in his sector 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.800
 we already started working on the comedy alexi prayer 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.749
 here we start from the text tradition 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.749
 the local Basque also with nathalie dupuy almost 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.400
 the adjustment could succeed six times a week it can not be necessary 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:17.459
 not to start a street by r a month before it is not possible so the language 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.100
 but otherwise right now the the bulk of the work if the album 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.219
 I recorded all my songs 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.680
 all the shields 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.139
 for me still some recorded titles 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.650
 and then what is it then what will happen to you personal title 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.420
 of the father 6000 the taf the afp 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.450
 until in august i just want that 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.300
 judge that this summer rather 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.330
 how to ask for rehearsals what am I going to do how do you 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.010
 busy tempting olala judge this case we will be happy 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.260
 I come from la verna just between the comedy between ladybugs 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.710
 deschamps between judges mans summer 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.650
 richard mantra lyon as mixed talks from here or elsewhere 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.780
 she wears a body show these are the differences and the different 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.050
 promotions and looters 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.339
 beyond 5% 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:06.979
 between another signal here there can not be a hundred bodies full of things 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.959
 who are going far who will avenge that will be done by then I do not know yet I 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:12.610
 can not tell you really 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.199
 what will be his case because it is a surprise smoking to have hoped 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.110
 in vain 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.630
 so stop doing the same thing by which the only port 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.819
 the poor 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.030
 heads the poor acharya nepal 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.910
 is there anything you can tell us maybe I guess 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.270
 for the musicals mcm certainly it's fine but the purpose of the game 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.059
 this release of his personal album no 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.309
 haidar and effective is not really because m 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.619
 me my goal to make sure that women that ah yes the situation was known 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:41.559
 gicquel arrived in front of chelsea and hate messages under me I dreamed 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:42.600

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.960

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.330

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.560
 the pastors and his agency was one meter from 2 94 th gaza 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.800

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.389
 a good part of 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.659

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.240
 to the Chinese giants 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.229
 the mission became my calm girlfriend 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.869
 in this concert it was great 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.719
 % by hand it was really nice 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:08.870
 one month 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.870
 so the intrigued to realize full of dreams of little girl 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:14.099

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.689
 manca to train for 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.019
 what we wanted to do when we were kids and we managed to 

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:22.999
 do it's true that it's a year it's a great happiness 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.210
 and then not after the after I do not know 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.039
 silence 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.499
 since it's half in cd and especially the audience the wise 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.659
 I manage the transcendence 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.379
 to choose m of what I have to appreciate appreciates perhaps only 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.110
 yes actually relationships between people and otherwise I'll be ready 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.830
 but the presence of women in the city of the pastels of the scene 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.370
 just be interpreted yet a character 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.540
