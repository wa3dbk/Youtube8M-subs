00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
can't go wrong with either no when it

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.190 
can't go wrong with either no when it

the<00:06:46.030> price<00:06:46.270> like<00:06:46.450> I<00:06:46.570> mentioned<00:06:46.870> earlier<00:06:46.930> in

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
the price like I mentioned earlier in

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.320 
the price like I mentioned earlier in
the<00:06:47.349> video<00:06:47.440> and<00:06:47.830> the<00:06:48.280> main<00:06:48.430> thing<00:06:48.789> for<00:06:48.820> me<00:06:49.120> is

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
the video and the main thing for me is

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.060 
the video and the main thing for me is
actually<00:06:49.510> the<00:06:49.720> form<00:06:50.140> factor

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
actually the form factor

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.040 
actually the form factor
also<00:06:51.310> the<00:06:51.400> operating<00:06:51.820> systems<00:06:52.180> so<00:06:52.900> it's

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
also the operating systems so it's

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.050 
also the operating systems so it's
definitely<00:06:53.470> important<00:06:53.950> to<00:06:53.980> go<00:06:54.190> into<00:06:54.460> a<00:06:54.490> local

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
definitely important to go into a local

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.050 
definitely important to go into a local
store<00:06:55.390> maybe<00:06:56.200> check<00:06:56.500> those<00:06:56.710> devices<00:06:57.010> out<00:06:57.340> see
