00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
higher you know vibration and fuel it so

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.969 
higher you know vibration and fuel it so
you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:18.990> constantly<00:01:19.320> moving<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> whole

it strengthens your immune system it's
allowing<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.950> immune<00:01:41.130> system<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.700> more

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
allowing your immune system to be more

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700 
allowing your immune system to be more
effective<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> getting<00:01:43.229> rid<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
effective and getting rid of it and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
effective and getting rid of it and
getting<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> body<00:01:44.399> quicker<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.659> it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
getting on the body quicker so it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.030 
getting on the body quicker so it's
actually<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.140> immune<00:01:46.350> system<00:01:46.649> -<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.890> also

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
actually the immune system - it's also

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.410 
actually the immune system - it's also
anti-inflammatory

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
anti-inflammatory

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
anti-inflammatory
now<00:01:48.720> acne<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.740> along<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.100> most<00:01:50.369> other

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
now acne is and along with most other

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.749 
now acne is and along with most other
diseases<00:01:50.880> nothing<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.509> than<00:01:51.630> inflammation

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
diseases nothing more than inflammation

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.020 
diseases nothing more than inflammation
so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.240> mean<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.750> inflammation<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.560> in

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
so I mean it's it's inflammation it's in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.430 
so I mean it's it's inflammation it's in
formation<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.570> caused<00:01:56.750> by<00:01:56.960> multiple<00:01:57.110> things

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
formation is caused by multiple things

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.700 
formation is caused by multiple things
but<00:01:58.150> fish<00:01:59.150> oil<00:01:59.510> is<00:01:59.600> one<00:01:59.840> thing<00:02:00.110> along<00:02:00.500> with

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
but fish oil is one thing along with

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.380 
but fish oil is one thing along with
coconut<00:02:01.310> oil<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.580> olive<00:02:01.820> oil<00:02:02.000> things<00:02:02.240> like

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
coconut oil and olive oil things like

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.810 
coconut oil and olive oil things like
that<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.080> anti-inflammatory<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:04.460> fish

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
that that is anti-inflammatory so fish

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.350 
that that is anti-inflammatory so fish
oil<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.240> great<00:02:05.509> because<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.200> basically

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
oil is great because it basically

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.550 
oil is great because it basically
reverses<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.569> inflammation<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.470> would

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
reverses that inflammation that would

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.170 
reverses that inflammation that would
cost<00:02:09.709> Ocoee<00:02:10.039> versus<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.060> also

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
cost Ocoee versus that so it's also

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.690 
cost Ocoee versus that so it's also
anti-inflammatory<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.260> then<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.430> those<00:02:13.550> are

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
anti-inflammatory and then so those are

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.100 
anti-inflammatory and then so those are
those<00:02:13.790> are<00:02:13.850> just<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.180> few<00:02:14.300> benefits<00:02:14.810> from<00:02:14.930> fish

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
those are just a few benefits from fish

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.710 
those are just a few benefits from fish
whole<00:02:15.290> there's<00:02:15.440> other<00:02:15.620> benefits<00:02:15.709> too<00:02:16.720> overall

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
whole there's other benefits too overall

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.880 
whole there's other benefits too overall
it's<00:02:17.810> very<00:02:17.840> good<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.380> your<00:02:18.500> health

hair and nails of all three but
specifically<00:03:57.300> we're<00:03:57.420> talking<00:03:57.630> about<00:03:57.690> it's

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
specifically we're talking about it's

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.970 
specifically we're talking about it's
gonna<00:03:57.990> keep<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.640> fluid<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.200> elastic<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.890> if

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
gonna keep the fluid and elastic so if

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.680 
gonna keep the fluid and elastic so if
your<00:04:02.130> skin<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.460> kind<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.700> dried<00:04:03.060> out<00:04:03.330> and

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
feels dead and you know you know just

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.760 
feels dead and you know you know just
dead<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.690> crusty<00:04:10.200> if<00:04:10.290> you're<00:04:10.440> not<00:04:10.590> pressing

into that further but but it's omega-3

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.159 
into that further but but it's omega-3
fatty<00:04:35.850> acids<00:04:36.270> are<00:04:36.390> great<00:04:36.600> for<00:04:36.750> hair<00:04:36.870> skin<00:04:37.080> and

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.060 
and then the that's the fish you're
eating<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:12.720> that's<00:05:12.930> that's<00:05:13.650> not<00:05:13.800> healthy

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
eating and that's that's not healthy

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.650 
eating and that's that's not healthy
fish<00:05:14.280> it's<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.669> like<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.510> like

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
fish it's just like the it's just like

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.390 
fish it's just like the it's just like
the<00:05:15.780> chickens<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.320> cows<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:17.100> are<00:05:17.160> being

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
the chickens and cows that are being

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.850 
the chickens and cows that are being
mass<00:05:17.729> produced<00:05:17.760> in<00:05:18.540> huge<00:05:18.810> buildings<00:05:19.410> but

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
mass produced in huge buildings but

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.290 
mass produced in huge buildings but
smell<00:05:20.040> some<00:05:20.310> way<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.790> they're<00:05:20.940> pumped<00:05:21.180> with

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
smell some way and they're pumped with

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.430 
smell some way and they're pumped with
hormones<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.780> things<00:05:21.900> like<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.140> so<00:05:22.260> they

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
hormones and things like that so they

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.719 
hormones and things like that so they
grow<00:05:22.590> quicker<00:05:22.919> it's<00:05:23.040> not<00:05:23.190> healthy<00:05:23.460> for<00:05:23.490> you

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729
