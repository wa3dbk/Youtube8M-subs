00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:08.109
 and we are new video all 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.190
 we are in the guide of the frontis the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.190
 episode number 3 and well now I'll be 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.359
 seeing here that we are on the bus 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.939
 as always remembering little things 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.310
 and what we have to do is take the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.470
 wind turbine vale 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.970
 it's not going to be very important we have to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 take the wind turbine that 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.810
 build the first room to be able 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.140
 build the pack up and that is the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.710
 machine to improve and good once done 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.390
 that we follow any forward 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.300
 good options if a little thing is worth 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.629
 the next stop 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.129
 yes good if we have caught the trapdoor 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.379
 well also instead of placing the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.610
 we can place it there and good 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.489
 there you can see that there is one thing for 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.619
 buy and are knuckles are worth they are 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.360
 a thousand times better than those that the knife 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.940
 good bowie then you can buy it there 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.300
 OK 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.519
 that the trapdoor is up at 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.770
 right on the objects sites 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.690
 random busses are there 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.180
 and well the trapdoor can be put 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.020
 up on the bus 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.299
 and well your next stop here we do 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.790
 a little bit of points accomplish things we 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.560
 we get through the bus and we continue 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 to the next stop I'm so 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.159
 it's going to be important 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.799
 well once we have stopped 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.170
 now what we have to do what 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.689
 first it's going to be to open the door of the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.300
 booth to enter the electricity 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.220
 how am I seeing there 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.470
 we take all the things we put them 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
 we made electricity and we become 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 to get on the bus quickly so that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.070
 do not leave us we have to lose very 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.300
 Quick 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.820
 and well now, as you see, we are giving 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.729
 we have arrived here is worth it and we have to 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.530
 burst the box the safe is 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.050
 controlled, we throw them close to the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.440
 grenades and the doors burst is 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.229
 a little unreal but if it's done like that and 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.230
 well once we've done that we 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.670
 back to the car as guilty from 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.950
 first of all if you want to buy 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.270
 to hold more and we have 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.160
 bus 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.140
 and now the thing is going to be screwed 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.380
 ok because we have to give this as much 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.150
 difficult of all we have to give a 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.360
 full return is valid for the entire map 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.670
 we have to get to the first stop 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.440
 and bonus at the first stop what 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 we have to catch is the fan that 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 good in this case to me if I go to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.520
 spend dollars will last us the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.130
 You have fan if used for 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.650
 other things and good we take the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.870
 fan we give the whole spin we leave 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.450
 always a zombie so that the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.850
 rounds and it's not as difficult as I say 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
 we left a zombie with diodes so that 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.450
 run 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.760
 we are getting into the bus 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.790
 so that it starts up we get 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 we are closing from the doors to 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.989
 zombie so that he does not give us the pain 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.739
 and well so until until 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.079
 get to the stop is simply to give 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.290
 a complete and good turn now that 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.409
 we have time I am going to talk to you a little 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.810
 of what's good there you can see that I 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.840
 I control the brightness is worth the knuckle 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.329
 he's always going to kill a bear we passed 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.730
 round 20 and that from the rent 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.140
 20 and will always have 3 pretty 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.210
 good as I say 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.170
 and it's much faster than the bowie knife 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.380
 and good now that I have time like now 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.940
 I say I wanted to talk about 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.940
 in the next episode that is going to be 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.940
 everyone 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.300
 of the standard truck as queries 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.120
 standard is very difficult is the most 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.080
 difficult that there is and then it is also everything 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.340
 prepared 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.190
 one click a barrier of zombies 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.430
 that good 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.870
 it's quite useful to make money and if 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.459
 I'm stuck, well, it's also 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.989
 quite useful and then also I do not 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.150
 agreement that I had more prepared for you 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.660
 I have to upload the first game of the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.660
 black ops 2 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.020
 I do not remember what else but good 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.520
 quite a few things as I say later 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.550
 I also have think of a video of 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.400
 all the random objects of the bus 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.300
 because you already know that the objects 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.389
 random these come out 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.190
 in quite a few different places 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.069
 How good I want to make a video 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.190
 collecting everything is going to cost 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:52.039
 enough because they are sites that are 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.379
 sure at each stage at each stop of the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.880
 bus there is one and well I want what 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:01.030
 you have all collected in the video 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.740
 and well we got here to the stop and 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.290
 well here attentive to the data we have to 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.700
 put here the mannequin and good here and the 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.940
 will say that we need a source of 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.280
 electricity we put this and if we do not 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.630
 he says he does not need any source of 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.350
 news means that we have done it 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.290
 well for once done this we're going to 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.260
 going to the bus loading milk is the most 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.350
 fast we can get inside 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.450
 of the bus or good in my case as not 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.490
 I had the races to climb inside 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.210
 the bus what I had to do was 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.639
 way to give the zombie such 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.440
 and good as you can see the bumper is 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.190
 better the fan is spent and in addition 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.259
 It pulls a lot when we put something on it 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.900
 that needs electricity is spent 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.759
 pretty fast and good as I say 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.259
 here trying to get the bus started 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.360
 to be able to put a year in as 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.650
 you can see there is the bumper that 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.830
 is so that the zombies do not get involved 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.620
 inside ahead and good they are 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.960
 find in a random site that 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.539
 well as I say this is the most 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.639
 difficult the items or objects for 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.650
 the bus that always leave in places 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.210
 different and good that 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.720
 I have to make the compilation video 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.590
 that is the only video that needs to be recorded 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.030
 and good 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.030
 let's see a bit the subject 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.889
 we come back in the safe 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.020
 OK 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.360
 we are finishing we came to stop at the 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:34.500
 safe as you can see is open 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.830
 this door remember that good here 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.210
 we're going from the backup thing before 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.280
 we have to take all the pieces that 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.979
 good to look for them work the corners 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.629
 as always we take them and we are 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.110
 riding on the crafter table is worth and 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:51.210
 will continue riding you have to take the east and 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.220
 good as if you leave this room is worth it 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.719
 will automatically close the composition 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.819
 we have to do the same process 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:58.800
 put the dummy again there because if 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.569
 the door is closed when leaving wants 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.699
 say that the mannequin has been spent and 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.199
 well what we should do is give all 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.470
 the return do the same process all the 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:09.070
 little while 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.660
 to be able to improve again and good this 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.190
 very good place to stand here 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.840
 rounds 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.940
 I would never leave here I always 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.440
 would leave a person in here all 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.420
 the time 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.430
 and what I recommend as duty is 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.420
 that understands all the pieces can 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.420
 improve the soul 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.580
 you can improve the weapon up to three times 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.320
 three times in a row depends on the 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.420
 images and you can leave them behind three 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.160
 the only times that you can not 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.710
 improve two or three times are the 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.450
 ballistic knife or the python and good 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.000
 is acting some weapons that are a 

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.700
 little peculiar but good otherwise 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.890
 it can improve everything 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.120
 the project that I am already putting the 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:54.060
 last part and we improve not only in the 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.510
 track how many times we want two or 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.180
 three times 

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.070
 same with this and show them if it has 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.680
 liked to leave a like and a comment 

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.510
 to know what you think and I say goodbye and 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.980
 see you in the next video a greeting 

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.250
 and until next time 

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.250
 bye
