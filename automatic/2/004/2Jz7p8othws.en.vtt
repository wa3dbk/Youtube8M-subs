00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.870 
different than the way it looks in real
life<00:04:22.850> which<00:04:23.060> kind<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.780> stinks<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:25.340> whenever<00:04:25.640> I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
life which kind of stinks but whenever I

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.180 
life which kind of stinks but whenever I
show<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.570> when<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:27.020> like<00:04:27.410> baked<00:04:27.710> you'll

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
show you it when it's like baked you'll

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.950 
show you it when it's like baked you'll
be<00:04:28.310> able<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.550> tell<00:04:28.730> how<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.000> looks<00:04:29.150> anyway<00:04:29.900> to

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
be able to tell how it looks anyway to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.960 
be able to tell how it looks anyway to
see<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:31.070> kind<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.669> looked<00:04:31.970> yellowy<00:04:33.970> it's

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
see that it kind of looked yellowy it's

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.820 
see that it kind of looked yellowy it's
hard<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.240> get<00:04:35.390> within<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.810> cracks<00:04:36.140> but<00:04:36.710> you

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
hard to get within the cracks but you

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.710 
hard to get within the cracks but you
really<00:04:36.860> don't<00:04:37.220> want<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.520> do<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.240> before<00:04:38.360> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
really don't want to do it before the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.180 
really don't want to do it before the
cracks<00:04:38.960> aren't<00:04:39.230> done<00:04:39.350> trust<00:04:39.680> me<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.010> a

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
cracks aren't done trust me it's a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.270 
cracks aren't done trust me it's a
little<00:04:40.760> bit<00:04:41.030> weird<00:04:41.480> I'm<00:04:42.470> gonna<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:42.980> do<00:04:43.130> that

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
little bit weird I'm gonna just do that

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.490 
little bit weird I'm gonna just do that
same<00:04:43.550> bit<00:04:43.850> just<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.480> really<00:04:45.140> don't<00:04:45.290> want<00:04:45.440> to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
same bit just you really don't want to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.720 
same bit just you really don't want to
overdo<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.950> because<00:04:46.130> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.400> always<00:04:46.520> add

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
overdo it because you can always add

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.490 
overdo it because you can always add
more<00:04:46.760> later<00:04:47.090> just<00:04:47.630> think<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.020> that's<00:04:48.290> what<00:04:48.440> I

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
more later just think that that's what I

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500 
more later just think that that's what I
always<00:04:48.530> think<00:04:48.980> because<00:04:49.730> if<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:50.000> overdo<00:04:50.480> it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
always think because if you overdo it

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.860 
always think because if you overdo it
then<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.050> will<00:04:51.200> just<00:04:51.410> look<00:04:51.530> burnt<00:04:52.720> unless<00:04:53.720> you

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
then it will just look burnt unless you

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.390 
then it will just look burnt unless you
want<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.229> pull<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.500> burnt<00:04:54.740> then<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.070> really

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
want to pull it burnt then you really

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.150 
want to pull it burnt then you really
make<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.610> dark<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.120> I'd<00:04:56.630> like<00:04:56.810> dark<00:04:57.080> brown

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.760
