plays with it and I'll see that's the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.190 
plays with it and I'll see that's the
most<00:02:20.860> important<00:02:21.310> thing<00:02:21.519> about<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.659> chapter

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
most important thing about this chapter

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.819 
most important thing about this chapter
ah<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.609> said<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.029> was<00:02:25.180> very<00:02:25.480> fun<00:02:26.319> chapter

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
ah like I said it was very fun chapter

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:27.280 
ah like I said it was very fun chapter
to<00:02:26.980> me

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
to me

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.750 
to me
but<00:02:27.409> it<00:02:27.530> doesn't<00:02:27.860> help<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.280> story

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
but it doesn't help the story

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.899 
but it doesn't help the story
progression<00:02:29.150> at<00:02:29.450> all<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:31.310> thought<00:02:31.579> as<00:02:31.760> if

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
progression at all and I thought as if

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.240 
progression at all and I thought as if
it<00:02:32.060> was<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.209> little<00:02:32.390> bit<00:02:32.540> cliche<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it was a little bit cliche and just the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.759 
it was a little bit cliche and just the
usual<00:02:34.459> comedy<00:02:35.090> wasn't<00:02:35.269> there<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.720> was<00:02:36.110> kind<00:02:36.530> of

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
usual comedy wasn't there it was kind of

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.819 
usual comedy wasn't there it was kind of
funny<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.849> wasn't<00:02:38.239> Mesa<00:02:38.659> quick<00:02:38.930> funny<00:02:39.560> it

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
funny but it wasn't Mesa quick funny it

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.309 
funny but it wasn't Mesa quick funny it
was<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.129> uh<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.879> guy<00:02:41.150> magically<00:02:41.780> London<00:02:42.170> to

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
was just uh this guy magically London to

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.380 
was just uh this guy magically London to
his<00:02:42.439> harem<00:02:42.890> group<00:02:43.159> type<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.640> funny<00:02:43.819> which

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
his harem group type of funny which

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.449 
his harem group type of funny which
we've<00:02:44.780> seen<00:02:45.049> plenty<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.829> plenty<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.220> times

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
we've seen plenty and plenty of times

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.170 
we've seen plenty and plenty of times
before

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
before

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.720 
before
so<00:02:47.599> it<00:02:47.959> kinda<00:02:48.319> just<00:02:48.349> doesn't<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:49.370> that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
so it kinda just doesn't have that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.979 
so it kinda just doesn't have that
effect<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.829> should<00:02:52.220> have<00:02:52.459> on<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.569> unless

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989
