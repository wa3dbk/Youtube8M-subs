last<00:00:08.910> month's<00:00:09.420> now<00:00:09.540> or<00:00:10.200> maybe<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.590> earlier

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
last month's now or maybe was earlier

last month's now or maybe was earlier
this<00:00:11.010> month<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.340> can't<00:00:11.519> remember<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.630> um

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
this month I can't remember but um

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.600 
this month I can't remember but um
anyways<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.620> doing<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> lot<00:00:14.280> slower<00:00:14.490> than

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
anyways I'm doing it a lot slower than

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.910 
anyways I'm doing it a lot slower than
she<00:00:14.880> does<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.560> playing<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
she does it one because I'm playing it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.290 
she does it one because I'm playing it
acoustically<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.670> would<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:17.850> really<00:00:18.090> hard<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
acoustically and would be really hard to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570 
acoustically and would be really hard to
keep<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.020> also<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.310> kind<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
keep up but also just because I kind of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.410 
keep up but also just because I kind of
like<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.789> slower

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
like it slower

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.870 
like it slower
it's<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:22.020> sounds<00:00:22.199> more<00:00:22.320> country<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.670> wish

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
