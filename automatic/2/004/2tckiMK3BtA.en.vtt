00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
impression was the original wrath was

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.160 
impression was the original wrath was
you<00:00:57.310> know<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.580> rat<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:58.120> nature<00:00:58.720> it<00:00:58.870> deals<00:00:59.050> with

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
you know the rat of nature it deals with

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.260 
you know the rat of nature it deals with
wrath<00:00:59.410> or<00:00:59.710> excuse<00:01:00.400> me<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.580> deals<00:01:00.760> nature

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
wrath or excuse me it deals nature

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.070 
wrath or excuse me it deals nature
damage<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:02.830> looks<00:01:03.100> like<00:01:03.190> some<00:01:04.080> organic

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
damage so it looks like some organic

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.680 
damage so it looks like some organic
ball<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.920> energy<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.610> this<00:01:06.850> just<00:01:07.180> looks<00:01:07.420> like

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
ball of energy and this just looks like

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.490 
ball of energy and this just looks like
straight<00:01:07.900> up<00:01:08.020> solar<00:01:08.440> energy<00:01:09.010> which<00:01:09.790> kind<00:01:10.150> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
straight up solar energy which kind of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.990 
straight up solar energy which kind of
is<00:01:11.500> contradictory<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.370> mean<00:01:12.550> there's<00:01:12.729> solar

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
is contradictory I mean there's solar

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.510 
is contradictory I mean there's solar
and<00:01:13.210> lunar<00:01:13.270> bars<00:01:13.930> right<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.920> this<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.220> dealing

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
and lunar bars right and this is dealing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.670 
and lunar bars right and this is dealing
with<00:01:15.550> magic<00:01:16.060> damage<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:17.050> nature<00:01:17.410> damage

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
with magic damage not the nature damage

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.130 
with magic damage not the nature damage
not<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.160> arcane<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:19.750> just<00:01:19.930> don't

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
not the arcane and I just don't

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.500 
not the arcane and I just don't
understand<00:01:20.680> why<00:01:20.800> they<00:01:21.490> chose<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.000> make<00:01:22.360> it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
understand why they chose to make it

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.170
