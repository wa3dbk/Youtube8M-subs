and<00:01:57.520> earlier<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.479> stage<00:01:58.719> which<00:01:58.990> pissed<00:01:59.259> me

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
and earlier in the stage which pissed me

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.760 
and earlier in the stage which pissed me
off<00:01:59.469> is<00:01:59.859> I<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:00.250> ripping<00:02:00.759> this<00:02:00.850> guy<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.119> shreds

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
off is I like ripping this guy to shreds

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.020 
off is I like ripping this guy to shreds
and<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.039> no<00:02:03.130> reason<00:02:03.429> I<00:02:03.490> switch<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.759> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and then for no reason I switch to the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.919 
and then for no reason I switch to the
Hydra<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.810> then<00:02:05.469> kill<00:02:05.710> him<00:02:05.829> I<00:02:06.689> find<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.780> best

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
Hydra and then kill him I find the best

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.570 
Hydra and then kill him I find the best
strategy<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.649> stay<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.160> upper<00:02:09.399> deck

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.250 
strategy is to stay on the upper deck
and<00:02:09.789> just<00:02:09.940> use<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.270> Hydra<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.750> snipe<00:02:10.960> him<00:02:11.110> in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and just use the Hydra to snipe him in

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.310
