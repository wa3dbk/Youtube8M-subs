00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
crews are in doing all kinds of

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.630 
crews are in doing all kinds of
construction<00:00:26.800> they've<00:00:26.919> taken<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.279> carpets

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
construction they've taken the carpets

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.150 
construction they've taken the carpets
down<00:00:27.790> or<00:00:28.029> scraping<00:00:28.300> off<00:00:28.509> glue<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:29.770> I<00:00:29.829> figured

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
down or scraping off glue so I figured

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.639 
down or scraping off glue so I figured
since<00:00:30.759> I<00:00:30.880> got<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.059> be<00:00:31.210> here<00:00:31.329> anyways<00:00:31.720> I<00:00:31.989> might

any<00:00:59.199> kind<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.769> detail<00:01:00.550> let's<00:01:00.850> just<00:01:01.059> get<00:01:01.179> the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
any kind of detail let's just get the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.270 
any kind of detail let's just get the
movements<00:01:01.749> down<00:01:01.929> I'll<00:01:02.469> talk<00:01:02.649> about<00:01:02.679> details

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
movements down I'll talk about details

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.749 
movements down I'll talk about details
later<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.260> most<00:01:05.440> important<00:01:06.040> aspect<00:01:06.579> of

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
later so the most important aspect of

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.340 
later so the most important aspect of
bagua<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.540> think<00:01:07.840> if<00:01:07.899> you<00:01:07.990> were<00:01:08.079> to<00:01:08.170> choose

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
bagua that I think if you were to choose

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.740 
bagua that I think if you were to choose
one<00:01:08.740> part<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.159> agua<00:01:09.549> that<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.570> most

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
one part of agua that is the most

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.170 
one part of agua that is the most
important<00:01:11.259> part<00:01:11.470> as<00:01:11.710> well<00:01:12.670> as<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.880> most

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
important part as well as the most

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.749 
important part as well as the most
important<00:01:13.630> part<00:01:13.810> for<00:01:13.960> every<00:01:14.259> sport<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.920> every

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
important part for every sport and every

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.520 
important part for every sport and every
piece<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.210> athleticism<00:01:16.570> on<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.960> planet<00:01:17.350> and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
piece of athleticism on the planet and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.030 
piece of athleticism on the planet and
that<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.939> connection<00:01:19.719> that<00:01:20.409> your<00:01:20.710> body

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
that is the connection that your body

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.380 
that is the connection that your body
has<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.299> planet<00:01:22.780> Earth<00:01:23.100> okay<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.909> when<00:01:25.149> you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
has to the planet Earth okay so when you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.109 
has to the planet Earth okay so when you
have<00:01:25.689> a<00:01:25.960> rooted<00:01:26.350> stance<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.100> when<00:01:27.640> your<00:01:27.820> feet

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
have a rooted stance and when your feet

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.289 
have a rooted stance and when your feet
are<00:01:28.390> firmly<00:01:29.130> connected<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.399> earth<00:01:30.729> by

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
are firmly connected to the earth by

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.740 
are firmly connected to the earth by
sinking<00:01:31.960> down<00:01:32.439> like<00:01:32.829> this<00:01:33.130> your<00:01:34.000> power<00:01:34.329> your

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
sinking down like this your power your

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.170 
sinking down like this your power your
strength<00:01:35.140> your<00:01:35.680> ability<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.189> perform<00:01:36.460> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
strength your ability to perform the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.779 
strength your ability to perform the
action<00:01:37.570> at<00:01:37.689> hand<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.110> amplified<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:39.549> much

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
action at hand is amplified so much

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.910 
action at hand is amplified so much

always holding this turn as we walk the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.369 
always holding this turn as we walk the
circle<00:03:24.669> it's<00:03:25.510> really<00:03:25.780> good<00:03:25.900> for<00:03:26.139> core

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
circle it's really good for core

and the form is long and challenging

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.550 
and the form is long and challenging
mentally<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.440> do<00:03:32.799> this<00:03:33.010> conditioning

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
mentally so you do this conditioning

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.869 
mentally so you do this conditioning
constantly<00:03:35.560> throughout<00:03:36.010> performin<00:03:36.609> of<00:03:36.730> no

reason to do bagua is for the visual

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.550 
reason to do bagua is for the visual
awareness<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.870> things<00:03:50.019> we<00:03:50.199> do<00:03:50.349> when

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
awareness one of the things we do when

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.399 
awareness one of the things we do when
you<00:03:50.650> bagua<00:03:51.069> is<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.489> are<00:03:51.760> watching<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.840> hands

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
you bagua is we are watching the hands

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.050 
you bagua is we are watching the hands
that<00:03:53.530> are<00:03:53.650> facing<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:54.190> center<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.639> our<00:03:54.729> circle

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
that are facing the center of our circle

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.460 
that are facing the center of our circle
which<00:03:55.359> we're<00:03:55.479> going<00:03:55.599> to<00:03:55.659> talk<00:03:55.750> about<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.989> second

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
which we're going to talk about a second

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.899 
which we're going to talk about a second
and<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:57.220> what<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.459> do<00:03:57.609> is<00:03:57.699> when<00:03:57.790> you're

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
and so what you do is when you're

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.869 
and so what you do is when you're
watching<00:03:58.090> your<00:03:58.419> hands<00:03:58.859> you're<00:03:59.859> focused<00:04:00.729> on

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
watching your hands you're focused on

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.599 
watching your hands you're focused on
one<00:04:01.180> point<00:04:01.569> but<00:04:02.169> your<00:04:02.379> peripheral<00:04:03.010> vision<00:04:03.040> is

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
one point but your peripheral vision is

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.280 
one point but your peripheral vision is
taking<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.720> everything<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.829> half

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
taking in everything this half

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.110 
taking in everything this half
around<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.129> when<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.459> ever<00:04:07.670> needing

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
around you and so when you ever needing

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.770 
around you and so when you ever needing
to<00:04:08.269> use<00:04:08.980> visual<00:04:09.980> awareness<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.450> street

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
to use visual awareness on the street

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.380 
to use visual awareness on the street
you're<00:04:12.019> going<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.200> have<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.950> ability<00:04:13.219> to<00:04:13.819> see

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
you're going to have the ability to see

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.629 
you're going to have the ability to see
a<00:04:14.420> lot<00:04:14.750> going<00:04:15.049> on<00:04:15.140> at<00:04:15.319> one<00:04:15.469> time<00:04:15.500> they<00:04:16.250> say<00:04:16.459> that

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
a lot going on at one time they say that

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.140 
a lot going on at one time they say that
the<00:04:16.789> brain<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.479> able<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.079> take<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.949> billions<00:04:19.850> of

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
the brain is able to take in billions of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.779 
the brain is able to take in billions of
sources<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.139> information<00:04:21.259> that<00:04:22.039> we<00:04:22.550> can<00:04:22.580> only

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
sources of information that we can only

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.719 
sources of information that we can only
access<00:04:23.060> such<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.690> small<00:04:24.110> percentage<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.310> so

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
access such a small percentage of and so

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.180 
access such a small percentage of and so
I<00:04:25.789> guess<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:27.080> could<00:04:27.110> say<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.710> bagua

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
I guess that you could say that bagua

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.939 
I guess that you could say that bagua
training<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.789> an<00:04:29.150> attempt<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.810> make<00:04:30.710> that

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
training is an attempt to make that

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.159 
training is an attempt to make that
percentage<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:32.180> what<00:04:32.539> we<00:04:32.630> can<00:04:32.750> actually

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
percentage of what we can actually

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.170 
percentage of what we can actually
consciously<00:04:33.800> proceed<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.550> our<00:04:34.639> vision<00:04:35.030> a

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
consciously proceed with our vision a

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.120 
consciously proceed with our vision a
little<00:04:35.630> bit<00:04:35.840> greater<00:04:36.080> whether<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.800> works<00:04:36.979> or

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
little bit greater whether it works or

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.360 
little bit greater whether it works or
not

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
not

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.950 
not
I<00:04:37.580> can<00:04:37.910> tell<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.360> does<00:04:38.509> improve<00:04:38.840> my

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
I can tell you that it does improve my

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.529 
I can tell you that it does improve my
visual<00:04:39.380> awareness<00:04:39.580> number<00:04:40.580> three<00:04:40.849> reason<00:04:41.240> to

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
visual awareness number three reason to

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.560 
visual awareness number three reason to
practice<00:04:42.169> bagua<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.910> for<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.270> fighting

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
practice bagua is for the fighting

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.930 
practice bagua is for the fighting
applications<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:45.830> bagua<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.430> very<00:04:46.669> much

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
applications and so bagua is very much

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.290
