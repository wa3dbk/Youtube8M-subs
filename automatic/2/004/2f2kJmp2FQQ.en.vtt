page 60 frames per second hey can I get
the<00:00:11.700> video<00:00:11.940> up<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.210> at<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> center<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.840> i<00:00:12.900> can

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the video up here at the center so i can

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:23.179 
the video up here at the center so i can
drive<00:00:14.900> all<00:00:15.900> right<00:00:19.400> ok<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.230> had<00:00:23.039> actually

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
drive all right ok so I I had actually

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.400 
drive all right ok so I I had actually
thought<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.939> figured<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.630> most<00:00:24.840> technically

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
thought I figured out most technically

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
thought I figured out most technically
of<00:00:25.619> how<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> wanted<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.510> over

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
of how I wanted to do this a little over

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.880 
of how I wanted to do this a little over
a<00:00:27.750> year<00:00:27.810> ago<00:00:28.019> when<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.380> were<00:00:28.560> talking<00:00:28.859> about

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
a year ago when we were talking about

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.030 
a year ago when we were talking about
doing<00:00:29.250> something<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.300> am<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.560> when

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
doing something on the way I am but when

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.700 
doing something on the way I am but when
i<00:00:32.070> spit<00:00:32.340> out<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.420> ahead<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.530> went

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
i spit out to to go ahead if this went

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.040 
i spit out to to go ahead if this went
really<00:00:34.890> fairly<00:00:35.430> smoothly<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.020> have

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
really fairly smoothly and here we have

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
really fairly smoothly and here we have
really<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> mega<00:00:38.399> textured<00:00:38.850> goodness

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
really all of the mega textured goodness

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
really all of the mega textured goodness
that<00:00:39.450> we're<00:00:39.600> used<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> enrage<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:41.340> many

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that we're used to enrage and in many

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.510 
that we're used to enrage and in many
ways<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.660> incredibly<00:00:43.379> cool<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.950> an<00:00:44.100> ipad

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
ways this is incredibly cool on an ipad

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.910 
ways this is incredibly cool on an ipad
where<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.420> touch<00:00:45.660> moved<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.440> around<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
where the touch moved it around and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
where the touch moved it around and
looking<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.370> i<00:00:47.700> did<00:00:48.210> some<00:00:48.360> fairly<00:00:48.600> clever

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
looking at it i did some fairly clever

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
looking at it i did some fairly clever
things<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> approximate<00:00:50.100> sub-pixel

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
things to approximate sub-pixel

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.299 
things to approximate sub-pixel
precision<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> movement<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
precision on the movement and the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
precision on the movement and the
visceral<00:00:53.309> feel<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.059> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> dragging

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
visceral feel of just kind of dragging

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.450 
visceral feel of just kind of dragging
the<00:00:55.289> thing<00:00:55.469> around<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.940> very<00:00:57.510> neat<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
the thing around I is very very neat and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.549 
the thing around I is very very neat and
this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> running<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.300> iphone<00:01:00.840> 4<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.530> i

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this is running on an iphone 4 where i

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380 
this is running on an iphone 4 where i
could<00:01:02.100> wind<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.579> cranking<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> few<00:01:03.329> things

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
could wind up cranking up a few things

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
could wind up cranking up a few things
go<00:01:03.870> ahead<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.140> run<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> big<00:01:04.619> screen<00:01:04.979> here

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
go ahead and run on the big screen here

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
go ahead and run on the big screen here
but<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.790> runs<00:01:05.939> great<00:01:06.299> actually<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:07.020> an

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
is just my technology demo we're in the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.580 
is just my technology demo we're in the
process<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.740> pulling<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.880> game

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
process of pulling this into a game

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.819 
process of pulling this into a game
framework<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
framework but I know this was one of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
framework but I know this was one of
this<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.490> great<00:01:41.759> points<00:01:42.150> where

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
this was one of my great points where

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
this was one of my great points where
I'm<00:01:42.630> able<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I'm able to just kind of go in and do

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.520 
I'm able to just kind of go in and do
something<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.479> leverage<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> my

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
something really leverage all of my

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.109 
something really leverage all of my
skills<00:01:46.860> come<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.670> leave<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> lot<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
skills come in and just leave a lot of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
skills come in and just leave a lot of
people<00:01:48.479> going<00:01:48.630> huh<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.799> how<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.189> get

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
people going huh what how but then I get

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
people going huh what how but then I get
to<00:01:53.369> turn<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> over<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> other<00:01:54.090> people<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> go

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to turn it over to other people to go

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
to turn it over to other people to go
ahead<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> through<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> real<00:01:55.920> hard<00:01:56.159> work

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
ahead and through all the real hard work

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.649 
ahead and through all the real hard work
of<00:01:56.579> actually<00:01:56.939> turning<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of actually turning it into a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.319 
of actually turning it into a
full-fledged<00:01:57.930> game<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.670> there's<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.180> little

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
full-fledged game but there's my little

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:12.280 
full-fledged game but there's my little
demo<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.890> crowd

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.300 

and<00:02:13.219> so<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.659> imagine<00:02:14.829> things<00:02:15.829> like<00:02:16.069> this

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and so you can imagine things like this

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.059 
and so you can imagine things like this
going<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:17.090> look<00:02:18.019> towards<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.379> industry<00:02:18.890> in

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
going I look towards the industry in

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.280 
going I look towards the industry in
future<00:02:19.459> years<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.420> idea<00:02:20.719> that<00:02:20.780> yeah<00:02:21.079> I<00:02:21.109> just

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
future years the idea that yeah I just

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.780 
future years the idea that yeah I just
pulled<00:02:21.680> out<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.890> my<00:02:21.980> pocket<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> machine

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
pulled out of my pocket the machine

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.940 
pulled out of my pocket the machine
there<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.319> I<00:02:24.379> could<00:02:24.590> kill

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
there that you know I could kill

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.949 
there that you know I could kill
anything<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.849> previous<00:02:26.390> generation

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
anything on a previous generation

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.559 
anything on a previous generation
console<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.709> an<00:02:27.890> Xbox<00:02:28.159> or<00:02:28.609> I've<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
console like an Xbox or I've you know a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.869 
console like an Xbox or I've you know a
ps2<00:02:30.109> or<00:02:30.140> something<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.310> hardware<00:02:31.670> that's

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
ps2 or something on the hardware that's

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.000 
ps2 or something on the hardware that's
there<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.329> not<00:02:32.510> as<00:02:32.750> powerful<00:02:32.989> as<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.620> current

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
there it's not as powerful as a current

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.399 
there it's not as powerful as a current
generation<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:34.939> it's<00:02:35.209> not<00:02:35.420> all<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.989> far<00:02:36.379> off

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
generation but it's not all that far off

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.319 
generation but it's not all that far off
where<00:02:37.370> you're<00:02:37.609> basically<00:02:37.730> looking<00:02:37.970> at

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
where you're basically looking at

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.429 
where you're basically looking at
something<00:02:38.540> with<00:02:38.810> vertex<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.379> fragment

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
something with vertex and fragment

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.910 
something with vertex and fragment
shaders<00:02:40.189> 512<00:02:41.060> megabytes<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.629> memory<00:02:41.689> I<00:02:42.290> pretty

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
shaders 512 megabytes of memory I pretty

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.610 
shaders 512 megabytes of memory I pretty
good<00:02:43.129> storage<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.819> there<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.379> you<00:02:45.379> know<00:02:45.470> you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
good storage on there and you know you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.140 
good storage on there and you know you
can<00:02:45.650> imagine<00:02:45.950> coming<00:02:46.430> up<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.670> playing<00:02:46.909> some

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
can imagine coming up and playing some

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.940 
can imagine coming up and playing some
things<00:02:47.420> plugging<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:47.959> put<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.379> the<00:02:48.470> big<00:02:48.620> screen

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
things plugging in put on the big screen

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.339 
things plugging in put on the big screen
or<00:02:49.129> on<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:49.370> small<00:02:49.639> screen<00:02:49.909> on<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.840> still

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
or on the small screen on there it still
