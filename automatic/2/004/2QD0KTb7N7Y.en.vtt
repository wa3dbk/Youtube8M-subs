00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and here fresh countries literally gave this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.200
 Germany has not reached 700 tons in a week 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.200
 their gold bars which they kept in 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.139
 United States vaults where these 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.509
 no one knows the Germans now 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.150
 forbid to make an audit of your good 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 moreover, the Americans even refuse 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590
 publish lists of numbers of gold 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 ingots which are taken from the Germans on 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.930
 storage is more than a scandal 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.960
 ingot price in the order of 200 billion 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.530
 dollars now the whole world suspects us 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.270
 in the waste they say if German gold 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.700
 quietly sold in difficult times 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.670
 crisis to maintain the dollar then 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.180
 why should the other actually survive 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 and what logic is the world anyway 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.190
 deals with the new American regime 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.420
 who literally despises the rights of all 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 other countries and peoples 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.539
 individuals whether their own or others 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.899
 bad story bad for the world and bad 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.090
 for us, we follow the transformation further 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.339
 not everyone on the planet wants her 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.049
 fit 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.659
 at least germany overestimate 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.820
 already a lot before the american spies helped 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.070
 from Berlin, our correspondent Catherine 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 zorin 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.909
 Well, do not return back at least 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.310
 count ingots fail 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.479
 Americans do not allow Germans to audit 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 allowed to pick up 5 tons of the scanty part 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.320
 identity fh tnt longer we do not think that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.180
 the board of the German central bank may 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 know what's really going on with 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 our gold is not no checks 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.700
 access to the counting books of the federal 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.409
 backup system he doesn't we don't 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
 we can be one hundred percent sure that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 our gold was not given mutually 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.350
 roughly support for the United States dollar or 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 to relieve market tensions 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.100
 doubt that the good will return to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.259
 German house has some 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.299
 American economists Paul Robert 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 prevailing in the reagan administration 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 situation commented so they forced 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.659
 Germany to accept the loss and stop 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.460
 demand to be returned 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 the United States simply ordered his 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.689
 puppet state of Germany 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 shut up and make a statement that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.200
 Berlin wants to keep its own 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.099
 Federal Reserve Gold Reserve 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 system 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.600
 official Berlin needed to answer 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.040
 from Germany expelled the main 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.500
 kan scout if you believe 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.490
 Internet head of the Berlin office of cr 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.860
 raalfa corrugation 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.080
 resident with experience the question is financial 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 where gold is so hung in the air and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 It seems that the German government has matured 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.410
 serious conversation with your own 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 Spiegel citizens from the front page 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.550
 asks whether it is worth it now 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.350
 trust the Americans Catherine Zorin 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.950
 Yevgeny Zhuravlev to lead the week 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.950
 Germany
