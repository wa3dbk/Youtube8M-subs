them<00:02:04.210> out<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.900> looks<00:02:05.020> really<00:02:05.200> nice<00:02:05.320> when

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
them out so it looks really nice when

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.290 
them out so it looks really nice when
slicing<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.220> chunks<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.790> you've<00:02:06.910> got<00:02:07.060> none<00:02:07.270> of

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
slicing in chunks and you've got none of

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.240 
slicing in chunks and you've got none of
those<00:02:07.540> little<00:02:07.930> hard<00:02:08.440> bitty<00:02:08.710> bits<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.160> will

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
those little hard bitty bits that will

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.700 
those little hard bitty bits that will
get<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.460> your<00:02:09.520> teeth<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.630> then<00:02:10.960> it's<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.500> how

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
get in your teeth and then it's just how

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.320 
get in your teeth and then it's just how
you<00:02:11.740> want<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.100> prepare<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.670> serve<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.150> I

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
you want to prepare it to serve it I

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.630 
you want to prepare it to serve it I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
take really nice thin slices and you can

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.510 
take really nice thin slices and you can
display<00:02:22.810> these<00:02:22.960> on<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> plate<00:02:23.410> fan<00:02:24.220> them<00:02:24.400> out

syrup or a chili syrup and then you can

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.250 
syrup or a chili syrup and then you can
just<00:02:30.970> arrange<00:02:31.360> them<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> platter

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
just arrange them on a platter

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
just arrange them on a platter
or<00:02:32.440> an<00:02:32.650> individual<00:02:33.160> plates<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.670> your<00:02:34.090> guests

or an individual plates for your guests
like<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.870> drizzle<00:02:35.709> over<00:02:35.980> something<00:02:36.280> that's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
like that drizzle over something that's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.699 
like that drizzle over something that's
really<00:02:36.670> nice<00:02:36.870> otherwise<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.170> want<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.440> chunk

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
really nice otherwise you want to chunk

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.980 
really nice otherwise you want to chunk
it<00:02:38.860> up<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.220> probably<00:02:39.340> do<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:39.880> fruit<00:02:40.480> salad

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990

or if you want to pop it on skewers on a
barbecue<00:02:43.930> or<00:02:43.959> something<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.130> what<00:02:45.820> we're

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
barbecue or something so what we're

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.100 
barbecue or something so what we're
going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> do<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.300> kind<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.630> cut<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.989> into

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
going to do is we kind of cut it into

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.449 
going to do is we kind of cut it into
quarters<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.620> we're<00:02:47.860> going<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.040> remove<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
quarters and we're going to remove the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.729 
quarters and we're going to remove the
woody<00:02:48.700> core<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:50.050> let's<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.350> like<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.470> in

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
woody core so let's go like this so in

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.060 
woody core so let's go like this so in
half<00:02:54.010> first<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.610> all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.580 

like<00:03:01.070> app<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.810> then<00:03:02.990> we're<00:03:03.140> going<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.320> put<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
like app and then we're going to put it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.750 
like app and then we're going to put it
into<00:03:03.740> quarters<00:03:05.920> if<00:03:06.920> you've<00:03:07.100> cut<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.550> nice<00:03:07.730> and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
into quarters if you've cut it nice and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.790 
into quarters if you've cut it nice and
thinly<00:03:08.240> like<00:03:08.270> that<00:03:08.630> then<00:03:09.320> you<00:03:09.440> won't<00:03:09.560> really

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
thinly like that then you won't really

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.110 
thinly like that then you won't really
get<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.160> woody<00:03:10.370> bit<00:03:10.580> in<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.760> middle<00:03:11.030> because

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
get the woody bit in the middle because

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.670 
get the woody bit in the middle because
it's<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:11.480> thinly<00:03:11.840> sliced<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:12.320> if<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.470> want<00:03:12.620> to

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
it's so thinly sliced but if you want to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.020 
it's so thinly sliced but if you want to
have<00:03:12.770> it<00:03:12.830> in<00:03:12.920> chunks<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:13.430> going<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.640> be<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.820> bit

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
have it in chunks it's going to be a bit

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.420 
have it in chunks it's going to be a bit
hard<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.330> eat<00:03:14.570> now<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.770> see<00:03:16.070> where<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
hard to eat now you can see where the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.430 
hard to eat now you can see where the
woody<00:03:16.640> begins<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.870> tell<00:03:18.140> where<00:03:18.320> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
woody begins you can tell where the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.740 
woody begins you can tell where the
flesh<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.040> vein<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.030> pineapple

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
flesh because the vein of the pineapple

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.880 
flesh because the vein of the pineapple
changes<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.800> just<00:03:22.070> run<00:03:22.310> your<00:03:22.490> knife<00:03:22.550> down

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
changes so just run your knife down

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.240 
changes so just run your knife down
along<00:03:24.890> that<00:03:24.920> core<00:03:27.190> discard<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:29.140> then<00:03:30.250> to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
along that core discard that and then to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.770 
along that core discard that and then to
whatever<00:03:31.400> size<00:03:31.730> chunks<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.270> want<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.630> can

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
whatever size chunks you want you can

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.130 
whatever size chunks you want you can
just<00:03:32.960> prepare<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.800> rest<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> pineapple

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.690 

that's<00:03:42.140> perfect<00:03:42.740> as<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.010> said<00:03:43.220> for<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.460> fruit

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
that's perfect as I said for a fruit

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.790 
that's perfect as I said for a fruit
salad<00:03:43.940> or<00:03:44.750> popping<00:03:45.080> onto<00:03:45.290> skewers<00:03:45.530> or

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
salad or popping onto skewers or

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.380 
salad or popping onto skewers or
something<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.730> that's<00:03:47.150> how<00:03:47.300> you

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
something like that and that's how you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.080 
something like that and that's how you
prepare<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> pineapple
