00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
people who we were really meant to be in

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.930 
people who we were really meant to be in
the<00:00:12.480> world<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.620> would<00:00:13.799> connect<00:00:14.429> more<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.849> our

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the world we would connect more with our

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.910 
the world we would connect more with our
true<00:00:15.240> selves<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.809> express<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.500> all<00:00:16.740> the

true selves and express that all the
time<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.490> that's<00:00:18.150> what<00:00:18.390> growth<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.140> going

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
time and that's what growth is is going

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.950 
time and that's what growth is is going
toward<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.550> connection<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.630> our<00:00:21.779> inner

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
toward that connection with our inner

toward that connection with our inner
true<00:00:22.380> self<00:00:23.539> but<00:00:24.539> why<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:26.250> me

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
true self but why don't we do it to me

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.330 
true self but why don't we do it to me
it<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.420> scary<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
it is because it's so scary and what is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.049 
it is because it's so scary and what is
really<00:00:29.820> scary<00:00:30.240> about<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:31.399> when<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> stop<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
really scary about it when I stop and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.650 
really scary about it when I stop and
think<00:00:33.140> about<00:00:34.140> why<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.800> has<00:00:35.250> been<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.460> scary<00:00:36.270> for

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
think about why it has been so scary for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.900 
think about why it has been so scary for
me<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.989> grow<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:38.489> growing

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
me to grow and really growing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.540 
me to grow and really growing
emotionally<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:40.260> breaking<00:00:40.710> from<00:00:41.370> my

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
emotionally it's breaking from my

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.110 
emotionally it's breaking from my
parents<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:43.079> breaking<00:00:43.550> not<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.910> from

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
parents it's breaking not just from

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020 
parents it's breaking not just from
their<00:00:45.329> fears<00:00:46.129> but<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> fears<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.760> they

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
their fears but the fears that they

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.200 
their fears but the fears that they
instilled<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> me<00:00:49.700> basically<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
instilled in me basically I see the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.830 
instilled in me basically I see the
family<00:00:51.600> system<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> cult<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
family system is kind of a cult and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.270 
family system is kind of a cult and
that's<00:00:54.840> including<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:55.860> families

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that's including really good families

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
that's including really good families
too<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.210> screwed-up

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
too not just the really screwed-up

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.099 
too not just the really screwed-up
families<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.539> because<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.079> don't

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
families and because of that they don't

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.310 
families and because of that they don't
want<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:02.210> breaking<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.780> their<00:01:03.989> way<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
want people breaking out of their way of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.740 
want people breaking out of their way of
doing<00:01:04.619> things<00:01:04.890> their<00:01:05.189> way<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.489> thinking<00:01:05.750> their

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
doing things their way of thinking their

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
doing things their way of thinking their
way<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.049> behaving<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> world<00:01:08.010> their<00:01:08.340> way

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
way of behaving in the world their way

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.380 
way of behaving in the world their way
of<00:01:08.580> interacting<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.220> also<00:01:11.220> thinking<00:01:11.970> beyond

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
of interacting and also thinking beyond

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.289 
of interacting and also thinking beyond
their<00:01:13.350> limits<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.189> many<00:01:14.460> parents<00:01:14.939> who

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
their limits now I know many parents who

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.510 
their limits now I know many parents who
say<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.020> children<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.560> go<00:01:16.710> beyond<00:01:17.040> me<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
say I want my children to go beyond me I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280 
say I want my children to go beyond me I
want<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.090> children<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.689> better<00:01:18.900> things

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
want my children to do better things

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
want my children to do better things
than<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.220> done<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> world<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
than I have done in the world and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
than I have done in the world and
actually<00:01:21.479> my<00:01:21.630> own<00:01:21.750> parents<00:01:22.200> said<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.460> I

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
actually my own parents said that but I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.850 
actually my own parents said that but I
think<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> caveat<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.540> most<00:01:24.990> people<00:01:25.320> don't

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
think the caveat that most people don't

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.940 
think the caveat that most people don't
add<00:01:26.189> most<00:01:26.640> parents<00:01:27.119> don't<00:01:27.450> add<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.080> they

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
add most parents don't add is they

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
add most parents don't add is they
really<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.729> want<00:01:30.150> their<00:01:30.329> children<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
really don't want their children to be

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
really don't want their children to be
more<00:01:31.380> emotionally<00:01:32.159> mature<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.270> are

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more emotionally mature than they are

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.399 
more emotionally mature than they are
and<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> basically<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:36.869> gonna<00:01:37.020> grow

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and so basically if you're gonna grow

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
and so basically if you're gonna grow
you're<00:01:37.920> gonna<00:01:38.040> leave<00:01:38.430> behind<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:39.150> past

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you're gonna leave behind your past

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
you're gonna leave behind your past
you're<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.320> leave<00:01:40.619> behind<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.340> parents

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you're gonna leave behind your parents

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
you're gonna leave behind your parents
your<00:01:42.450> family<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> cults<00:01:43.649> from<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
your family the cults from which you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
your family the cults from which you
came<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:45.119> may<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> leave<00:01:45.630> behind<00:01:45.869> your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
came you may have to leave behind your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.490 
came you may have to leave behind your
culture<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.380> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
culture or a lot of it and I think this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.499 
culture or a lot of it and I think this
is<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.770> an<00:01:49.920> internal<00:01:50.399> process<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> terror

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
is all an internal process to the terror

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.030 
is all an internal process to the terror
isn't<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.110> terror<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> they're<00:01:52.920> gonna

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
isn't just terror that they're gonna

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920 
isn't just terror that they're gonna
reject<00:01:53.490> me<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.820> they're<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.119> gonna<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.720> me

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
reject me and they're not gonna like me

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.520 
reject me and they're not gonna like me
the<00:01:55.530> terror<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.130> within<00:01:56.460> mostly<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:58.020> when

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the terror is within mostly because when

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
the terror is within mostly because when
we're<00:01:58.649> children<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.729> internalize<00:02:00.090> our

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
we're children we internalize our

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
we're children we internalize our

parents we take them inside of us and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.039 
parents we take them inside of us and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
they become a part of us they actually

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
they become a part of us they actually
help<00:02:04.469> us<00:02:04.590> develop<00:02:05.130> our<00:02:05.219> personality<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.630> good

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and for bad and so we have to break with

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.530 
and for bad and so we have to break with
sides<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.530> ourselves<00:02:11.480> we<00:02:12.480> enter<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
sides of ourselves we enter a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.979 
sides of ourselves we enter a
and<00:02:13.659> that<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.140> don't<00:02:14.379> know<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.209> into<00:02:16.390> places

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
and that we don't know we go into places

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.569 
and that we don't know we go into places
that<00:02:17.680> are<00:02:18.040> very<00:02:18.370> unusual<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:21.250> we're<00:02:21.459> gonna

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
that are very unusual and if we're gonna

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.970 
that are very unusual and if we're gonna
really<00:02:21.790> do<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.209> well<00:02:22.450> we're<00:02:23.349> gonna<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.829> all

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
really do it well we're gonna be all

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.360 
really do it well we're gonna be all
alone

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
alone

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.660 
alone
and<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.049> deepest<00:02:26.500> fear<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.129> I've<00:02:27.310> seen

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and so the deepest fear that I've seen

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.940 
and so the deepest fear that I've seen
and<00:02:27.939> myself<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.659> others<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.909> fear<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and myself and others is the fear of the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.949 
and myself and others is the fear of the
child<00:02:33.310> within<00:02:33.670> us<00:02:33.849> being<00:02:34.120> abandoned

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
child within us being abandoned

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.080 
child within us being abandoned
so<00:02:35.409> it's<00:02:35.560> childhood<00:02:36.069> abandonment<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.909> that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so it's childhood abandonment that that

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.420 
so it's childhood abandonment that that
comes<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:37.689> with<00:02:38.650> growth<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.340> growth<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.389> also

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
comes up with growth and growth is also

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.559 
comes up with growth and growth is also
facing<00:02:43.920> facing<00:02:44.920> our<00:02:45.189> limitations<00:02:45.849> facing<00:02:46.450> our

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
facing facing our limitations facing our

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.589 
facing facing our limitations facing our
traumas<00:02:47.189> grieving<00:02:48.189> them<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:49.030> means<00:02:49.299> bringing

were once so important to me and that is

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.899 
were once so important to me and that is
entering<00:03:32.409> a<00:03:32.590> whole<00:03:32.829> new<00:03:32.859> terrain<00:03:33.430> where<00:03:33.819> the

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
entering a whole new terrain where the

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.360 
entering a whole new terrain where the
rules<00:03:34.180> are<00:03:34.389> different<00:03:34.419> and<00:03:34.900> our<00:03:35.500> internal

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
rules are different and our internal

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.800 
rules are different and our internal
cells<00:03:36.790> define<00:03:37.780> these<00:03:38.049> rules<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:40.180> simply

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
cells define these rules and it's simply

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.349 
cells define these rules and it's simply
not<00:03:41.079> easy<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.590> also<00:03:42.430> think<00:03:42.760> another<00:03:42.879> thing<00:03:43.239> that

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
not easy I also think another thing that

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.449 
not easy I also think another thing that
makes<00:03:43.510> growing<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.409> scary<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.190> difficult

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
makes growing so scary and so difficult

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.509 
makes growing so scary and so difficult
is<00:03:45.879> that<00:03:46.269> on<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:47.049> really<00:03:47.440> deep<00:03:47.470> level<00:03:47.620> not<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> lot

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
is that on a really deep level not a lot

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.369 
is that on a really deep level not a lot
of<00:03:48.549> people<00:03:48.940> are<00:03:49.060> doing<00:03:49.419> it<00:03:49.569> that<00:03:49.989> has<00:03:50.109> been<00:03:50.139> my

and<00:03:57.699> I<00:03:58.269> think<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.019> part<00:03:59.229> of<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.379> problem

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
and I think this is part of the problem

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.920 
and I think this is part of the problem
humanity<00:04:00.669> has<00:04:00.819> not<00:04:00.970> yet<00:04:01.239> reached<00:04:01.449> a<00:04:01.689> critical

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
humanity has not yet reached a critical

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.849 
humanity has not yet reached a critical
mass<00:04:02.310> not<00:04:03.310> even<00:04:03.669> close<00:04:03.909> to<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:05.019> most

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
mass not even close to it so that most

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.259 
mass not even close to it so that most
of<00:04:05.979> the<00:04:06.069> people<00:04:06.220> who<00:04:06.400> are<00:04:06.519> doing<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:06.939> deep

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
of the people who are doing really deep

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.719 
of the people who are doing really deep
inner<00:04:07.659> work<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.169> really<00:04:08.409> grow<00:04:08.829> in<00:04:09.129> significant

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
inner work to really grow in significant

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.300 
inner work to really grow in significant
ways<00:04:09.849> are<00:04:10.150> doing<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.659> almost<00:04:11.290> entirely<00:04:11.829> alone

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
ways are doing it almost entirely alone

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.659 
ways are doing it almost entirely alone
and<00:04:13.139> it's<00:04:14.139> very<00:04:14.349> scary<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.919> do<00:04:15.069> something<00:04:15.459> this

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
and it's very scary to do something this

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.909 
and it's very scary to do something this
profound<00:04:16.120> alone<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.169> lot<00:04:17.320> easier<00:04:17.530> with

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
profound alone it's a lot easier with

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.339 
profound alone it's a lot easier with
allies<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.030> think<00:04:19.269> if<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.479> world<00:04:19.690> changed<00:04:20.259> I

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
allies so I think if the world changed I

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.659 
allies so I think if the world changed I
think<00:04:20.530> if<00:04:20.620> there<00:04:20.739> were<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.829> lot<00:04:21.190> more<00:04:21.220> people

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
think if there were a lot more people

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.240 
think if there were a lot more people
who<00:04:22.000> were<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.180> lot<00:04:22.479> more<00:04:22.690> visible<00:04:23.200> about<00:04:23.800> really

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
who were a lot more visible about really

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.230 
who were a lot more visible about really
doing<00:04:24.550> massive

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
doing massive

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.580 
doing massive
and<00:04:25.509> really<00:04:25.750> getting<00:04:25.990> in<00:04:26.080> touch<00:04:26.229> with<00:04:26.440> who

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
and really getting in touch with who

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.350 
and really getting in touch with who
they<00:04:26.710> really<00:04:26.860> were<00:04:27.009> at<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.310> deep<00:04:27.490> level<00:04:27.520> it

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
they really were at a deep level it

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.610 
they really were at a deep level it
would<00:04:28.479> be<00:04:28.569> a<00:04:28.600> lot<00:04:28.840> easier<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.440> would<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.590> a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
would be a lot easier and it would be a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.110 
would be a lot easier and it would be a
lot<00:04:29.830> less<00:04:30.039> scary<00:04:30.340> because<00:04:30.789> there<00:04:30.910> would<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.030> a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
lot less scary because there would be a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.960 
lot less scary because there would be a
new<00:04:31.300> group<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.569> hold<00:04:31.900> us<00:04:32.139> right<00:04:32.860> now<00:04:33.130> since

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
new group to hold us right now since

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.029 
new group to hold us right now since
we're<00:04:34.150> doing<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.419> alone<00:04:34.660> we<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.830> face

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
we're doing it alone we have to face

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.349 
we're doing it alone we have to face
this<00:04:36.340> abyss<00:04:36.880> of<00:04:37.210> horror<00:04:37.569> all<00:04:37.840> by<00:04:38.199> ourselves
