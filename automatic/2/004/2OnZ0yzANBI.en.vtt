00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.740
 and there are very good other people that such 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.950
 how are you welcome to a new 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.889
 tutorial on how to make a director of 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.750
 players and agent this have asked me 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.460
 much by private message today is a 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.529
 detector of players to cheat 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.850
 etc 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.590
 well this is not only good to do 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.390
 traps and accomplishes a lot of things people 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.029
 for example to activate something without that without 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.399
 that there is nothing to activate it 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.020
 and is visually not good because I'll 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.510
 teach a little how it works 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.399
 a few accessories here for 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.100
 that you see how it would be in the form of a trap 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.110
 for example okay and well let's twist 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.200
 around here and I know not with April and we 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.260
 we are going to fall, and how can you choose 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.260
 an object worth this is based on this 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.510
 technique is worth while going through here I'm going to 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.149
 catch an object is worth any of you 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.520
 you put and you are going to activate a circuit 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.890
 doing anything is worth it to me 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.770
 let it explode read this any 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 thing is good, let's go with the tutorial 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.880
 good good people first thing we're going to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.820
 do is show how this works 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.610
 to see if I'm less than this is the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.700
 glass hall almost and from one of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 width that I pass through here is worth not 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.500
 nothing happens but if I put here in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.900
 this corner as you see 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.240
 this corner I go through here and be 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.150
 together block equivalents if I put in 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.300
 this corner an item like that and that is 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.790
 floating then when I pass through here what 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.070
 I pick up even if the item is here what 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.869
 I pick up perfect because this was based on 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.460
 I will teach you 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.530
 a moment how it's done from the back 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 it's because they do not have anything more people 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.840
 as we see here our corner such and 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.000
 well here would be the circuit worth 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.130
 only a soldering iron a plate 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.410
 pressure of wood so that the item me 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.630
 is is activating the depressions of 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.300
 the non-active stone plate is activate 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.340
 with items and neither as arrows nor with anything 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.759
 and here a reston torch that happens 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.739
 with this it is worth imagining and I will decide but 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.230
 nobody passes here and then meditate 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.270
 Well, this trap would not work 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.160
 circuit make that resets each 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.260
 some time is worth what you have to have 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.540
 note that it is a trap of tnt this 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.760
 are activated only with the item available 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.400
 It's worth it when it comes to making yourself 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.530
 except for this corner I'm going to pick 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.360
 the item and what we're going to see is that it 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.810
 will automatically reset the farm 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.410
 OK 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.380
 I remember 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.570
 and it resets itself is worth so to speak 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.930
 when I pick up the item it resets and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.630
 active over what is left behind 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.940
 I've done a trap here before 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.940
 simple for fall is worth simply put 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.300
 the ribbons here for example okay let's go 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.490
 to put the example here 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.640
 that the pulling these blocks caught 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.320
 towards here and the objective that had wafer 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.690
 in this trap it would be very good since 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.400
 you put a lot of blocks down 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.010
 and down with said percy all 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.700
 correct the other side of the enemy 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.320
 they would be picked up okay ok here we can 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.450
 that a staircase is worth to pass the 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.420
 current 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.910
 to see right here since by the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.390
 another side looks exactly the same 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.849
 well here you can take the flow 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.220
 of this pressure play is worth being 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.520
 active is for 'being plate here will go 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.240
 an active momentum ale 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.240
 we go up here 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.920
 and correct these people and good this 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.560
 lentil ladder will pass these 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.880
 evils well then we in theory if 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.770
 we went through here what we would do exist 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.620
 and we would stay good people I hope that 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.850
 you liked this tutorial and now 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.840
 you know 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.840
 bye
