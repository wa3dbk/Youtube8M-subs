00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
why I do this it doesn't take me very

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090

much time and to me it's well worth it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.460 
much time and to me it's well worth it
well<00:01:23.520> worth<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.939> half-hour<00:01:24.570> after<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
well worth the half-hour after what I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.320 
well worth the half-hour after what I
put<00:01:25.650> into<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.610> black<00:01:26.790> electricians

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

put into this so the black electricians
tape<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.659> use<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> hold<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> bubble<00:01:28.680> plastic

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
tape I use to hold on the bubble plastic

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
tape I use to hold on the bubble plastic
most<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.759> bubble<00:01:30.030> plastic<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.540> used<00:01:30.689> for

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
most you know bubble plastic is used for

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
most you know bubble plastic is used for
packing<00:01:31.229> very<00:01:31.799> good<00:01:31.979> insulator<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.549> these

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
packing very good insulator for these

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
packing very good insulator for these
bananas<00:01:33.119> I've<00:01:33.600> been<00:01:33.780> growing<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.079> since

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
bananas I've been growing these since

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.190 
bananas I've been growing these since
1989<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.270> few<00:01:36.509> years<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.960> used<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
1989 and the first few years I used to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350 
1989 and the first few years I used to
protect<00:01:37.530> them<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> cage<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.909> leaves

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
protect them with a cage with leaves

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
protect them with a cage with leaves
inside<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> tarp<00:01:40.259> over<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> found<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
inside and a tarp over it but I found a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
inside and a tarp over it but I found a
better<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.210> bubble<00:01:42.479> raft<00:01:42.689> works<00:01:42.960> really

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
better way the bubble raft works really

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.410 
better way the bubble raft works really
nice<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.520> simple<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.299> it's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
nice and it's simple to use and it's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.230 
nice and it's simple to use and it's
easy<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.840> store<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.520> I'll<00:01:47.520> grab<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> camera<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
easy to store so I'll grab the camera in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
easy to store so I'll grab the camera in
a<00:01:48.270> minute<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> show<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.399> what

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
a minute and I'm going to show you what

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
a minute and I'm going to show you what
we've<00:01:50.579> done<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> pups<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.479> don't<00:01:51.630> worry

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
we've done here the pups I don't worry

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
we've done here the pups I don't worry
about<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> gets<00:01:52.799> cold<00:01:53.040> it'll<00:01:53.250> freeze<00:01:53.490> these

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
about if it gets cold it'll freeze these

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
about if it gets cold it'll freeze these
down<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.630> say<00:01:54.780> last<00:01:54.960> winter<00:01:55.290> was<00:01:55.380> so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
down but like I say last winter was so

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
down but like I say last winter was so
mild<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.640> didn't<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.060> frost<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
mild we didn't get any frost here and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.730 
mild we didn't get any frost here and
they<00:01:57.719> went<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:57.930> through<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.290> winter<00:01:58.560> till

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
they went right through the winter till

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
they went right through the winter till
spring<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> leaf<00:01:59.280> state<00:01:59.579> green<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.329> started

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
spring the leaf state green and started

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
spring the leaf state green and started
growing<00:02:01.350> again<00:02:01.500> new<00:02:01.799> ones<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.219> ended<00:02:02.670> up

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
growing again new ones and ended up

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
growing again new ones and ended up
cutting<00:02:02.939> off<00:02:03.149> all<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> old<00:02:03.630> ones<00:02:03.750> summers

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
cutting off all the old ones summers

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.810 
cutting off all the old ones summers
very<00:02:04.680> dry<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
very dry there so you see a lot of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600 
very dry there so you see a lot of
burning<00:02:06.240> along<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> edge<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.500> these<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
burning along the edge of these of the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.820 
burning along the edge of these of the
foliage<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> bad<00:02:10.349> day<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.649> here

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
foliage so it's not a bad day out here

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
foliage so it's not a bad day out here
it's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> nice<00:02:11.129> day<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.520> protecting<00:02:11.940> bananas

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's a nice day for protecting bananas

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.429 
it's a nice day for protecting bananas
it's

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439

getting near mid-october and still

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.379 
getting near mid-october and still
continuing<00:02:17.430> drying<00:02:17.670> looks<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:17.999> next<00:02:18.180> week's

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:18.389 
continuing drying looks like next week's

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.670 
continuing drying looks like next week's
forecast<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.139> to<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.260> nice<00:02:19.439> and<00:02:19.620> warm

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
too but I just like to get this done in

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.170 
too but I just like to get this done in
case<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.859> sudden<00:02:23.159> cold<00:02:23.400> wave<00:02:23.609> comes<00:02:23.909> in<00:02:24.060> in

growers love to grow these in your
gardens<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.069> there's<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.219> bubble<00:02:44.459> plastic

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
gardens so there's the bubble plastic

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.670 
gardens so there's the bubble plastic
these<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.629> bigger<00:02:45.810> bubbles<00:02:46.169> on<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.500> one

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
these are the bigger bubbles on this one

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.619 
these are the bigger bubbles on this one
here<00:02:47.459> there's<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.939> smaller<00:02:48.180> bubbles<00:02:48.540> they

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
here there's the smaller bubbles they

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.869 
here there's the smaller bubbles they
both<00:02:48.780> work<00:02:49.019> sufficiently<00:02:49.769> well<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
both work sufficiently well here in the
