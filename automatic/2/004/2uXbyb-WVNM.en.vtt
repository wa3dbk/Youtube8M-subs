00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.969
 [Applause] 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.740
 the first law or principle 1 of mendel 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.790
 it is known as the principle of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.730
 uniformity of hybrids in f1 this law 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.489
 it's known like that because when they cross 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.840
 two progenitors one purebred 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:32.230
 dominant to uppercase a capital 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.590
 another purebred recessive to tiny to 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:41.050
 lowercase all his descendants are 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.969
 Hybrids equal to uppercase or lowercase 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.399
 to this first generation of 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.399
 descendants that come from 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:53.320
 Purebred progenitors is called 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:56.590
 first generation filial or f1 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.800
 the capital letters represent the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.830
 dominant characters the letters 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 lower case letters represent the characters 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.010
 recessive 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.850
 when an individual has the genotype a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 uppercase to uppercase means that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.700
 inherited a dominant gene from the father and a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.950
 dominant gene of the mother because of this 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.219
 known as purebred or homozygous 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.030
 when an individual has the genotype a 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:32.149
 lowercase to lowercase means that 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.640
 inherited a recessive gene from the father and a 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.090
 recessive gene of the mother 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.700
 as both genes are recessive this 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 individual is also of pure race or homo 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.070
 zygote when an individual has the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.810
 Genotype to uppercase or lowercase 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.330
 means that he inherited a dominant gene from 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.480
 one of its parents and a gene 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.540
 recessive of the other parent 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.650
 how the individual has a dominant gene 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.860
 and another recessive is no longer pure race 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.950
 so it is mastered hybrid or 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.110
 heterozygotes 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.989
 the characteristics of the genes 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 dominant appear whenever a 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.220
 individual carries a dominant gene by 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.080
 example in the case of peas the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.870
 yellow color of the seeds is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.049
 dominant 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.209
 so if the genotype of a plant 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.030
 of pea is capitalized a capital letter 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.870
 the pea seed will be yellow 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.750
 if the genotype is a capital letter or 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.810
 tiny the seed will also be 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.050
 yellow because the gene is present 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.680
 dominant to uppercase 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.620
 and the recessive characters are observed 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.910
 only when the dominant gene is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.750
 absent therefore a green seed 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.470
 has a recessive phenotype homozygous to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.970
 lowercase to lowercase since if it were 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.120
 heterozygous to uppercase to lowercase the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.940
 seed of the plant would be yellow 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.180
 the dominant gene would not allow it to 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.320
 express the phenotype encoded by the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.320
 recessive allele 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.080
 the phenotype is the characteristic 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.200
 observable in this case the color of the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.530
 fried pork seed 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.400
 For its part, the genotype refers to 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.239
 type of genes that the individual has in 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.080
 summary the phenotype is the way in which 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.959
 the genotype and genotype is manifested 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.620
 is the kind of genes that the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.620
 individual 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.699

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.690
 the first law of mendel can be

 graph in a square 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.350
 of punnett as follows 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.970
 one is made a table of three 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.650

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.140

 male gametes this is a capital letter and 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.680
 a capital letter 3 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.630
 in the horizontal gray cells it 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.280
 write down the possible alleles of the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.820

 female gamete 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.980
 this process is done as follows
