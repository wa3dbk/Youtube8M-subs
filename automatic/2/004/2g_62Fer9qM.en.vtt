Padawan<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.549> doesn't<00:02:53.760> deserve<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.000> read<00:02:54.180> yet

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
Padawan so it doesn't deserve a read yet

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
really like to seen it to have in a

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.920 
really like to seen it to have in a
longer<00:05:58.490> rope<00:05:58.669> giving<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.330> know<00:05:59.449> when
