00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.269
 and hello everyone I'm ready in a video and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.979
 well we are in minecraft and good the 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.660
 truth is that he had been very inattentive 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.839
 and had not realized that they had left 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 new commands that the truth is 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.590
 extremely good and that gives me the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.410
 opportunity to make them many more 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.780
 tutorials that I found by a forum 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.360
 such as create response 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.220
 Customized our customized and 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.380
 many things that are already going up 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.820
 little by little I will try to climb right now 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.440
 video per day because the truth is that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'm really enjoying this and I 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.570
 I would like you to know it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 good today we're going to see a command that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.030
 good flame let's see over here 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.220
 the command called set block for what 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 this command serves what that blog does 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.600
 is basically putting one more block or 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.150
 less like word and I do not know if some 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 you know him but nothing else can 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.700
 put a single block over there I read that it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.250
 plans that this can be done soon 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.870
 like the chubby or with many blocks 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.059
 remove blocks things of that style with 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.370
 pure command although I was age prefer 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.160
 al mst in fine very well 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.720
 said block what it occupies is these new 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.340
 little things that the truth is that I do not know how 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.400
 put them on the keyboard you do not see the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.860
 little symbol here or anything like that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 so I copy them I leave them in the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 description by the way all the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.290
 commands that you use here will be gone 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.830
 leaving in the description very well set 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.690
 What block it occupies are coordinates 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.670
 mainly but not coordinates 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.620
 take in kraft customers with this 3 if 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.620
 it is not used coordinates in a way 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.170
 different takes the command block as 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.200
 the coordinate 000 height 0 and all 0 then 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.530
 for example 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.980
 here is unlocked this would be x this 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.310
 it's still there and this would be z 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.170
 and this would be 0 2 to 0 because it's the height 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.560
 zeros that would give the same heights in this 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.820
 same height I hope it's clear 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.410
 well these would be coordinates have 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.690
 that put this thing and then the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.310
 coordinate space this thing and then 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.470
 the coordinate and so on xyz 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.010
 then you have to write minecraft two 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.370
 points and the block they want to place 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.630
 with lowercase letters then a zero that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.950
 in truth I do not know very well why 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.580
 I still do not understand it at all 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.220
 but I can explain them to you and then in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.880
 replay yes that would be to replace or if 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.680
 there is a block and for example if I have 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 here I can replace a block 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.540
 ruben 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.770
 and it seems to me that the replay was removed 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.260
 it does not replace it anymore 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.300
 until the block disappears puts it 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.300
 or if he did it good 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.040
 well I do not know why he did it because not the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.650
 joke is that something like that goes very well 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.870
 This command works like this stay 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.189
 clear in the block can do anything for 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.409
 stones example 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.110
 everything has capitals I committed 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.560
 an error that was to put with the first 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.090
 capital letter and this was replaced 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.680
 can be with any block to 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.390
 exception of things like I do not know about swords 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.159
 things like that and if your block 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.340
 Take a space for example to see one 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.750
 easy that they do not give much English 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.680
 crafting table 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.680
 it would be like that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.090
 and put a diagonal of the ones below 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.629
 table 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 yes and well they put everything very nice 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.000
 everything all not very well now basically 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.980
 this is the command after a while I'm going to 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.750
 teach how to spawn with this be 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.360
 customize your remaining spaces 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.310
 very spawn is how you want with the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.239
 range you want even more than with 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.769
 msd can be customized even that 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.230
 bring enchanted armor to all that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.599
 very well but that will be the time now them 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190
 I'm going to give a small example, let's say 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.200
 it's an adventure map is a puzzle 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.329
 they have a minute to get to four 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.000
 stations and have all this be thrown away 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:11.200
 to deactivate a pump for example 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.049
 very well I do not know this is the first 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.239
 station they do trip here that happens 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.579
 the network are just one example I'm just 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.229
 of happening recently I got well and now and so 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.820
 the pump is already deactivated it's just a 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.250
 example the truth is that the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.660
 command but at the moment it's a bit 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.510
 this useless except for the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.720
 We are so I recommend them to 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.370
 your adventure maps and by the way to 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.340
 I'll give you a tour of my house 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.100
 I'm finishing after years 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.980
 and well, we have all this here and 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.870
 very nice and then after a while I bring 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.970
 many more tutorials of various commands 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.280
 that have been dating and I did not even 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.810
 I found out well, I hope this has been 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.400
 liked and see you in a following 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.400
 video until the next goodbye
