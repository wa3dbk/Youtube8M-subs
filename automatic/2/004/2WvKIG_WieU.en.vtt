also<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.750> expect<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> lights<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> turn

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
also you would expect the lights to turn

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.280 
also you would expect the lights to turn
green<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.310> they're<00:01:56.460> fully<00:01:56.729> charged

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
green when they're fully charged

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
green when they're fully charged
which<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.829> believe<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.130> say<00:01:59.310> putting<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
which I believe they say putting on the
charge<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.180> 10<00:02:00.329> hours<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> first<00:02:00.899> get

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
charge for 10 hours when you first get

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
charge for 10 hours when you first get
them<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> thought<00:02:02.310> -<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> charger<00:02:03.030> 24

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
them but I thought - on the charger 24

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
them but I thought - on the charger 24
hours<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.560> lights<00:02:04.740> were<00:02:04.890> still<00:02:04.920> ready<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
hours and the lights were still ready so

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.190 
hours and the lights were still ready so
I'm<00:02:05.670> gonna<00:02:05.790> sure<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.329> my<00:02:06.479> lights<00:02:06.719> don't<00:02:06.930> turn

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
