with<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.090> Pittsburgh<00:00:47.300> Steelers<00:00:47.600> certainly<00:00:48.470> I

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
with the Pittsburgh Steelers certainly I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:01:02.710

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
think there's a bison is then we'll

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.689 
think there's a bison is then we'll
handle<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.110> will<00:01:03.290> take<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.680> lead<00:01:03.920> with<00:01:04.430> most

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
handle it will take it lead with most

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.680 
handle it will take it lead with most
important<00:01:05.089> thing<00:01:05.180> isn't<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.510> much<00:01:05.540> the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
important thing isn't so much the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.900 
important thing isn't so much the
punishment<00:01:06.260> is<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.440> lessen<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.280> he's<00:01:07.640> learned

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
punishment is to lessen and he's learned

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.110 
punishment is to lessen and he's learned
and<00:01:08.150> only<00:01:08.930> times<00:01:09.170> gonna<00:01:09.380> tell<00:01:09.820> he's<00:01:10.820> got<00:01:11.030> an

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
and only times gonna tell he's got an

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.400 
and only times gonna tell he's got an
opportunity<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.340> think<00:01:14.020> restore<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
opportunity to to I think restore the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.550 
opportunity to to I think restore the
faith<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:16.180> people<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.900> league<00:01:18.080> in<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
faith that people in the league in the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.080 
faith that people in the league in the
city<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.860> Pittsburgh<00:01:19.340> when<00:01:19.580> his<00:01:19.700> football
