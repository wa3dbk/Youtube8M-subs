kind of tapers down and then from about
the<00:01:24.570> probe<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.159> spinal<00:01:26.549> cord

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
the probe down it is the spinal cord

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.609 
the probe down it is the spinal cord
okay<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> another<00:01:30.810> model<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.350> brain

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
okay this is another model of the brain

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.740 
okay this is another model of the brain
that<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.250> need<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> point<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.540> let's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that I need at this point but let's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.679 
that I need at this point but let's
orient<00:01:34.170> ourselves<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.460> model<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.570> we

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
orient ourselves to this model here we

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.940 
orient ourselves to this model here we
find<00:01:36.930> cerebrum

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
find cerebrum

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.359 
find cerebrum
here's<00:01:38.369> cerebellum<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.350> pons

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
here's cerebellum this is pons

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.780 
here's cerebellum this is pons
this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.299> medulla<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.399> here<00:01:44.430> is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this is medulla and then down here is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
this is medulla and then down here is
spinal<00:01:45.299> cord<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.409> based<00:01:46.710> essentially

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
spinal cord so it's based essentially

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.780 
spinal cord so it's based essentially
the<00:01:47.460> same<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.570> model<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
the same but on this model we have the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
the same but on this model we have the
hypothesis<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> pituitary<00:01:51.780> gland<00:01:52.110> which

this white little stick like thing which

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.719 
this white little stick like thing which
is<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.750> infundibulum<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> here's<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
is the infundibulum so here's the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.210 
is the infundibulum so here's the
infundibulum<00:02:06.110> here's<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> hypothesis<00:02:08.069> or

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
infundibulum here's the hypothesis or

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639

where I able to bend in between here and

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.210 
where I able to bend in between here and
see<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:36.209> see<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:37.260> bumps<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:38.040> make

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
see it I could see the bumps that make

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.430 
see it I could see the bumps that make
up<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.549> corpora<00:03:38.940> quadrigemina<00:03:39.349> although<00:03:40.349> I'm

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
only looking at half of them now so

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.330 
only looking at half of them now so
instead<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.510> four<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> can<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.379> two<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:44.280> is
