00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hey, what 's up, man? 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 welcome to one more 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 personal video as you have seen from the title 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.500
 dude this video is going to be epic is going to be 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 finally the great decision of which is the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
 car faster gta5 personal beauty the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 Next I'll explain to you the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.869
 rules and I'll put on the screen the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
 dispute the four fastest cars to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.070
 to leave the gta that the entity 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 adler and use around is personal rules 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.510
 next, all cars will do this. 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 Straight here, okay? 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 they will start with the wheel on top of the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.950
 last track not of that in the case of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.420
 first track here and that track both 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 the car pump wheels on top of this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.170
 track and both cars 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.450
 In fact, all four cars will be 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 two blocks away or for one 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 block and another block on top of the line 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.440
 two wheels of the auto school that is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.649
 gift for example stay will be here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.739
 the start of the test for all of them beauty 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 is the following you will see now 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.500
 the dispute between the cars and myself 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'll tell you the difference between them. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.790
 It can be can be expensive I think amoral 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.799
 I think they are the same because the following 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
 well I'll talk later you see 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.420
 The video makes watching the video, it's watching. 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 the four in the end will have a slow 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 motion rim and then after the slow motion I 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.240
 I'll put my final considerations 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.240
 b since though the video 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.290
 the beauty but is the following you saw there 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.440
 The first result was the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.760
 entity followed face because of 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.760
 thousandths by the az around shortly after 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.320
 the last tour in the forecourt of the crowd 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.209
 first to the last if you 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.670
 to repair is in the case does not 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.459
 control is like the times 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.880
 thousandths of a second and is as follows 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.390
 were face between the first between the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.510
 so oo oite tite and goodbye the difference 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.430
 It was less than 1 second ago. 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.900
 what do we do? 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.700
 consideration only by remembering the cases 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.130
 not so quintana and none so all 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.620
 generated newcomers there in the garage 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.600
 Geez, what do we take in? 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.130
 consider that cases 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.470
 as severe and or less than one second 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.840
 honestly I think everyone is the same 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.480
 because this one second that gave 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.750
 between the first and the last may have been 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.540
 affected a little something I did in 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.400
 To realize is a little wind that hit by 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.410
 Who knows that gta has a physical 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.920
 own very fuck mainly with 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.810
 regarding air resistance and tals 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.670
 may be a synchronization error of the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 video that honestly is not me 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.320
 all the calculations right I made one is 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.209
 in the case whenever he accelerated with the car 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.870
 first accelerated afterwards did not release r 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.150
 2 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.640
 I made a noise I do well in all 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.670
 It's very tall, and I made the cut. 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.350
 based on this, so it's more expensive 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.940
 can be can be by a thousandth of 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 second difference of each of the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.000
 cars resulted in the adept 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.890
 was quoted the most slowly in the then 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.920
 according to the western section is the 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.079
 fast if the test is 100% correct 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.320
 entity the car imt the fastest followed 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.660
 ten thousandths wander around by 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.170
 a couple more times but a 30 40 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.170
 thousandths there for tourism and then for 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.989
 90 thousandths for the one of personal beauty if 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.340
 the test is 100% correct this 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.079
 result like this has to play a 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.880
 margin of error I honestly 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.470
 I do not think it 's seen that franklin 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.389
 it was a little hat to drive suspended 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.780
 and he gets so personal it's like he can not 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.880
 gives to 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.609
 100% correct the test in the gallery 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.710
 unfortunately then I really think that 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.480
 they all run the same thing to them 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.960
 must be made and must have been made 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.870
 all under the same mold in the case then 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.210
 so type cast then they picked up a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.580
 very fast car in these formats and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.610
 over them draw the horn shape 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.120
 is style wheel and tals 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.889
 and then the cars have the same result 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.970
 Beauty guys, I honestly think it's 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.410
 equal wanted to know how the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.510
 I wanted to comment that you leave a 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.250
 commenting on what you think 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.510
 Do you really think that you are the same as 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.040
 it has an equal result according to 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.260
 what you can see in my video or if 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.600
 do you think any of the results there 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.360
 it went wrong if you think some car 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.669
 faster such remembering in textiles 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 cars without danny ie all cars 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.080
 pealed and the result was this until 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.419
 possible that making some cars have 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.640
 difference between the other and such 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.290
 I drove faster here on the 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.210
 I'm from the funk garage to the 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.950
 place that I was the same entity 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.020
 chairman regretted it was the car that 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.510
 I got here faster nor is it mine. 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.050
 favorite car in the game but apparently 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.060
 it is yes the faster beauty the test is 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.880
 correct and if it's not correct I repeat 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.300
 is the tie because the difference between one and 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.860
 another was minimal personal beauty I hope 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.510
 That was cool, I pray for 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.210
 Please allow too much evaluation. 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.940
 I work to make this video and it's expensive. 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.250
 joinha your favorite are key 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.600
 At this moment I hope you have 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.520
 liked the video
