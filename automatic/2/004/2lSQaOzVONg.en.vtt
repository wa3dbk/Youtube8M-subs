00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
my video that I would do something on

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.459 
my video that I would do something on
isolating<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.000> muscles<00:00:41.390> next<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
isolating the muscles next to

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.040 
isolating the muscles next to
visualization<00:00:43.429> isolating<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.420> muscles<00:00:44.809> is

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
visualization isolating the muscles is

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.009 
visualization isolating the muscles is
also<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> very<00:00:45.829> important<00:00:46.370> part<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:47.019> facial

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
also a very important part of facial

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.000 
also a very important part of facial
exercises<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.920> getting<00:00:49.609> it<00:00:49.699> right<00:00:49.940> means

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
exercises and getting it right means

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.840 
exercises and getting it right means
that<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:52.370> that<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.839> will<00:00:53.989> not<00:00:54.429> create<00:00:55.429> extra

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
that it that you will not create extra

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.619 
that it that you will not create extra
wrinkles<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:56.300> your<00:00:56.329> face<00:00:56.920> if<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:57.980> do<00:00:58.219> it<00:00:58.370> wrong

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
wrinkles on your face if you do it wrong

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.029 
wrinkles on your face if you do it wrong
unfortunately<00:00:59.629> if<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:00.289> keep<00:01:00.530> doing<00:01:00.890> and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
unfortunately if you keep doing and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.579 
unfortunately if you keep doing and
educating<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> muscles<00:01:02.480> in<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.140> certain<00:01:03.440> way

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
educating the muscles in a certain way

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.490 
educating the muscles in a certain way
you<00:01:03.859> will<00:01:03.890> create<00:01:04.400> wrinkles<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.200> some<00:01:06.200> people

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
you will create wrinkles and some people

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.370 
you will create wrinkles and some people
do<00:01:06.650> say<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.100> facial<00:01:07.460> exercises<00:01:08.170> create<00:01:09.170> more

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
do say that facial exercises create more

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.240 
do say that facial exercises create more
wrinkles<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:11.060> they<00:01:11.360> possibly<00:01:11.810> could<00:01:12.170> but<00:01:13.130> you

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
wrinkles and they possibly could but you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.740 
wrinkles and they possibly could but you
have<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.580> know<00:01:13.700> how<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.910> do<00:01:14.120> them<00:01:14.300> properly

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
have to know how to do them properly

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.500 
have to know how to do them properly
and<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.680> reason<00:01:16.010> why<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:17.270> been

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
and this is the reason why I have been

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.590 
and this is the reason why I have been
giving<00:01:17.780> these<00:01:17.900> videos<00:01:18.320> out<00:01:18.730> so<00:01:19.730> when<00:01:20.480> you're

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
giving these videos out so when you're

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000 
giving these videos out so when you're
after<00:01:20.900> laying<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.260> muscles<00:01:21.620> what<00:01:21.890> it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
after laying the muscles what it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.010 
after laying the muscles what it
actually<00:01:22.160> is<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.120> you're<00:01:23.480> using<00:01:23.720> your

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
actually is is the you're using your

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.740 
actually is is the you're using your
fingers<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:25.130> create<00:01:25.280> resistance<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
fingers to create resistance on the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.560 
fingers to create resistance on the
muscles<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.640> your<00:01:28.640> fingers<00:01:29.090> are<00:01:29.450> very

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
muscles and your fingers are very

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.770 
muscles and your fingers are very
similar<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.980> weights<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:32.120> use<00:01:32.450> when

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
similar to the weights that you use when

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.350 
similar to the weights that you use when
you<00:01:32.900> go<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.290> gym<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:33.910> if<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.030> can<00:01:35.180> see

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
you go to the gym so if you can see

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.000 
you go to the gym so if you can see
yourself<00:01:35.720> at<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.930> gym<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:36.830> lifting

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
yourself at the gym and you're lifting

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.060 
yourself at the gym and you're lifting
weights<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.660> weights<00:01:38.900> are<00:01:39.170> heavy<00:01:39.410> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
weights and the weights are heavy the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.120 
weights and the weights are heavy the
weight<00:01:40.280> creates<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.210> resistance<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
weight creates the resistance in the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.340 
weight creates the resistance in the
same<00:01:43.370> way<00:01:43.640> your<00:01:44.180> fingers<00:01:44.750> create<00:01:45.230> the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
same way your fingers create the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.680 
same way your fingers create the
resistance<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:46.100> these<00:01:46.520> tiny<00:01:46.940> muscles<00:01:47.480> on<00:01:47.660> your

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
resistance on these tiny muscles on your

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.020 
resistance on these tiny muscles on your
face<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:48.860> we<00:01:48.920> can't<00:01:49.250> possibly<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:50.660> weights

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
face now we can't possibly have weights

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.850 
face now we can't possibly have weights
you<00:01:53.030> know<00:01:53.150> for<00:01:53.630> weight<00:01:54.080> lifting<00:01:54.410> on<00:01:54.500> our<00:01:54.620> face

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
you know for weight lifting on our face

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.430 
you know for weight lifting on our face
so<00:01:55.190> because<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.240> muscles<00:01:56.660> are<00:01:56.810> just<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.140> fun

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so because the muscles are just so fun

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.990 
so because the muscles are just so fun
and<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:57.740> much<00:01:58.070> smaller<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.700> rest<00:01:58.910> of

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and so much smaller and the rest of

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.390 
and so much smaller and the rest of
ending<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.390> rest<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.690> our<00:01:59.780> body<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:01.040> our

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
ending the rest of our body so our

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.520 
ending the rest of our body so our
fingers<00:02:01.790> are<00:02:01.940> perfect<00:02:02.390> perfectly<00:02:03.260> designed

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
fingers are perfect perfectly designed

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.190 
fingers are perfect perfectly designed
for<00:02:04.010> this<00:02:04.130> purpose<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.720> when<00:02:05.900> you're<00:02:06.050> creating

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
for this purpose so when you're creating

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.590 
for this purpose so when you're creating
resistance<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.880> instance<00:02:08.240> if<00:02:08.420> you're<00:02:08.570> doing

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
resistance for instance if you're doing

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.140 
resistance for instance if you're doing
the<00:02:08.990> eye<00:02:09.020> exercise<00:02:10.009> which<00:02:10.460> helps<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.970> reduce

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the eye exercise which helps you reduce

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.840 
the eye exercise which helps you reduce
wrinkles

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
wrinkles

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.840 
wrinkles
around<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.600> eyes<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:13.350> if<00:02:13.800> you're<00:02:14.400> creating

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
around your eyes here if you're creating

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.680 
around your eyes here if you're creating
resistance<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.930> lift<00:02:16.920> up<00:02:17.130> your<00:02:17.340> eyes

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
resistance you have to lift up your eyes

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.200 
resistance you have to lift up your eyes
place<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:18.930> fingers<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.250> lines<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
place your fingers in the lines in the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.330 
place your fingers in the lines in the
in<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> place<00:02:21.690> where<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> lines<00:02:22.890> generally

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
in the place where the lines generally

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.920 
in the place where the lines generally
crinkle<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:24.900> hold<00:02:25.290> them<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:26.250> tight

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
crinkle and then hold them really tight

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.590 
crinkle and then hold them really tight
so<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.500> see<00:02:29.090> I'm<00:02:30.090> creating

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
so as you can see I'm creating

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.530 
so as you can see I'm creating
resistance<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.130> muscle<00:02:32.490> pulls<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
resistance as the muscle pulls in and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.030 
resistance as the muscle pulls in and
incidentally<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.260> exercise<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.010> really

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
incidentally this exercise is really

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.320 
incidentally this exercise is really
good<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.970> look<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.190> see<00:02:38.460> how

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
good if you look up so you can see how

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.200 
good if you look up so you can see how
I'm<00:02:39.780> pulling<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> muscle<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.830> bit<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:42.030> I've

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
I'm pulling the muscle a bit so I've

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.900 
I'm pulling the muscle a bit so I've
stretched<00:02:42.690> them<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.290> eyes<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:44.250> pulling

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
stretched them the eyes up I'm pulling

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.280 
stretched them the eyes up I'm pulling
the<00:02:45.000> muscle<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.390> little<00:02:45.630> bit<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.960> I'm<00:02:46.050> holding

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the muscle a little bit and I'm holding

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.820 
the muscle a little bit and I'm holding
it<00:02:46.560> firm<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.730> what<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.120> does<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.840> as<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
it firm and what this does is as the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.000 
it firm and what this does is as the
muscle<00:02:50.190> poor<00:02:50.430> source<00:02:50.910> or<00:02:51.470> cripples<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.680> or

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
muscle poor source or cripples in or

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.850 
muscle poor source or cripples in or
moves<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.240> you're<00:02:54.870> actually<00:02:55.200> pulling<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.710> out

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
moves in you're actually pulling it out

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.520 
moves in you're actually pulling it out
of<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.400> your<00:02:56.550> fingers<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.230> that's<00:02:58.230> where

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
of it with your fingers and that's where

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.340 
of it with your fingers and that's where
the<00:02:58.650> resistance<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.450> now<00:03:00.450> very<00:03:00.750> similar<00:03:01.170> if

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the resistance is now very similar if

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.740 
the resistance is now very similar if
you're<00:03:01.500> doing<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.180> exercise<00:03:03.180> between<00:03:03.420> your

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you're doing the exercise between your

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.770 
you're doing the exercise between your
eyes<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.680> place<00:03:04.980> your<00:03:05.250> fingers<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
eyes you place your fingers on the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.390 
eyes you place your fingers on the
muscle<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:08.840> push<00:03:09.840> down<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
muscle and you push down and then you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.280 
muscle and you push down and then you
push<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.120> muscle<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:14.690> now<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.140> do

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
push the muscle up now you have to do

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.780 
push the muscle up now you have to do
this<00:03:16.410> with<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> degree<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.130> firmness<00:03:17.400> not

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
this with a degree of firmness not

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.330 
this with a degree of firmness not
really<00:03:18.120> hard<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.960> a<00:03:19.020> degree<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.530> firmness<00:03:19.830> so

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
really hard but a degree of firmness so

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
really hard but a degree of firmness so
that<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.640> starts<00:03:21.060> creating<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.720> resistance

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that it starts creating that resistance

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
that it starts creating that resistance
now<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.520> what's<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:24.240> really

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
now this is what's really really

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.920 
now this is what's really really
important<00:03:25.490> for<00:03:26.490> your<00:03:26.790> facial<00:03:27.030> exercises<00:03:27.660> you

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
important for your facial exercises you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.170 
important for your facial exercises you
do<00:03:28.110> need<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.860> again<00:03:29.610> with<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:29.910> nose

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
do need to do this again with your nose

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.080 
do need to do this again with your nose
you<00:03:30.480> need<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.750> hold<00:03:30.960> that<00:03:31.110> up<00:03:31.550> push<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.580> up<00:03:32.850> and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
you need to hold that up push it up and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.270 
you need to hold that up push it up and
then<00:03:33.560> pull<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:35.010> muscle<00:03:35.430> down<00:03:36.710> now<00:03:37.710> employing

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
then pull the muscle down now employing

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.850 
then pull the muscle down now employing
the<00:03:38.490> muscle<00:03:38.850> down<00:03:39.090> or<00:03:39.450> pulling<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> muscle<00:03:40.560> in

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
the muscle down or pulling the muscle in

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.150 
the muscle down or pulling the muscle in
or<00:03:41.130> pulling<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> muscle<00:03:42.330> up<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.920> is

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
or pulling the muscle up that is

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.970 
or pulling the muscle up that is
exercising<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.150> muscle<00:03:45.560> obviously<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.770> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
exercising the muscle obviously up and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.970 
exercising the muscle obviously up and
down<00:03:47.330> but<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> fingers<00:03:48.900> are<00:03:49.170> creating<00:03:49.800> all

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
down but the fingers are creating all

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.940 
down but the fingers are creating all
that<00:03:50.250> weight<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.170> muscle<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.740> move

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that weight so that the muscle can move

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.100 
that weight so that the muscle can move
and<00:03:53.280> start<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.790> release<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.210> lactic<00:03:54.540> acid

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
and start to release the lactic acid

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.470 
and start to release the lactic acid
now<00:03:55.710> as<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.040> lactic<00:03:56.340> acid<00:03:56.670> starts<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.180> release

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
now as the lactic acid starts to release

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.690 
now as the lactic acid starts to release
what<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.440> means<00:03:58.710> is<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.010> all<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.340> energy

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
what that means is that all the energy

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.270 
what that means is that all the energy
in<00:04:00.300> in<00:04:00.540> very<00:04:00.810> simple<00:04:01.170> terms<00:04:01.230> all<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.770> energy

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
in in very simple terms all the energy

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.090 
in in very simple terms all the energy
in<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.520> muscle<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.300> cells<00:04:04.100> releasing

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
in the muscle and in the cells releasing

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.570 
in the muscle and in the cells releasing
they're<00:04:05.610> exhausting<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:08.040> means<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
they're exhausting and that means that

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.690 
they're exhausting and that means that
you<00:04:08.730> are<00:04:08.850> getting<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.420> best<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:11.040> best

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
you are getting the best the best

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.610 
you are getting the best the best
workout<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:12.630> your<00:04:12.750> face<00:04:12.960> when<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.350> start

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
workout for your face when you start

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.039 
workout for your face when you start
feeling<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.190> lactic<00:04:14.610> acid<00:04:15.000> burn<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.570> that's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
feeling that lactic acid burn and that's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.570 
feeling that lactic acid burn and that's
what<00:04:16.230> it's<00:04:16.350> often<00:04:16.620> called<00:04:16.830> if<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.250> lactic

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
what it's often called if the lactic

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.930 
what it's often called if the lactic
acid<00:04:17.880> burn<00:04:18.560> if<00:04:19.560> you're<00:04:19.770> if<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.100> go<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.280> gym<00:04:20.700> you
