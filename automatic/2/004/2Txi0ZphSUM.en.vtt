00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.590
 overview of two devices a party of regions 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 leopard 8 inch 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.619
 on the device is made in a thin case in 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.949
 the quality of performance they have the same 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.739
 This is the third revision of the device and 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.339
 rework not visible to the naked eye 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.400
 This applies primarily to the screen 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.600
 the film has become thicker added the senate is not 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.569
 framework 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.569
 Corps fasteners are also thicker 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.519
 both devices work under 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.080
 running google android 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.080
 1 and 5 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.740
 dismantling them too is the same 1.3.2 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 vice versa for each device 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 there is an accelerometer 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.950
 and two gigabytes of memory 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.520
 but pay attention to 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.970
 special offer for 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.760
 data services device site is 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.630
 100 rubles per gigabyte 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.130
 can be calculated 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.950
 I wondered what her wisdom card 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.650
 you need 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.620
 extra brightness according to apparatuses 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.630
 acceptable 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 seven-inch aspect ratio 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.730
 has a screen resolution of 800 by 480 pixels 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 and the aspect ratio is 16 9 and 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.510
 eight-inch has a ratio of 4 to three 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.870
 and accordingly points 800 on 600 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.010
 it can be seen 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.080
 in the browser 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 on the example of the mayor 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.960
 here we see 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.150
 fits into the screen of each device 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.880

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.370
 does not open 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.710
 especially with each device 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 for watching movies more suitable 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
