00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hall youtube and welcome to 9 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.670
 sloth country video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.189
 we start a new energy drink 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 test series and that around the ok 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.710
 energy drinks or 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.680
 they are really ok - 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 Energy drinks probably had them 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.730
 the point - still behind it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 I can you even okay ice brand you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 can not really be protected 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.510
 and of course I start with that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 normal to the energy drink i say now 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 just a classic no zero no sorry 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.649
 no other taste is in there 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.570
 but the normal stuff around simple 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.610
 comparatively point to have a fix point 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 I also like the other caterings 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.620
 then you can measure that by the design 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 I just succeeded this ok 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.879
 dot on it and then black and white 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 kept the other cans 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.879
 they still have that over fed 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 ok in white and then depending on 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.050
 Taste and variety are there 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.550
 then other color on it very nice so 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 visually I like that is something 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 other not that everyone here is trying 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 something with silver blue and white and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.880
 make red and then somehow like that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.340
 imitate other manufacturers 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.470
 then the ok drinks come out of the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 Switzerland from Switzerland being this one 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 here is now produced in Austria 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.500
 and then do not know where the jan 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 thank you very much at this point again 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 year media all members 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.170
 or was sent the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.670
 bought a few varieties okay there is 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.500
 meanwhile also here in Germany 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 but I think most of the holders in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.650
 Austria and Switzerland so all 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.750
 others we should look at 45 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 kilo calorie per 100 milliliter gift 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.939
 that is quite normal with and 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 Caffeine 32 milligrams per 100 milliliters 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.670
 Fits Fed it is free here found 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.770
 why is that because the foreign bought 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.409
 probably not but the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.570
 always make theirs the normal 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.880
 found bypass trick because you look up 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.299
 the ingredients is the first one is the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.040
 main component with 76% dairy 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.990
 This is always such a thing 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.980
 namely, when the actually even water 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.960
 besides as the main base then 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.340
 it is due to hurl it 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.020
 But now there is only one 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.100
 still only water still left 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.380
 stay and do yours 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.670
 Energy consumption is the whole thing up 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.230
 once found free 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.510
 just on the edge little lesson 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250
 but now we've talked enough 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.320
 want to know how the stuff tastes so 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.570
 I'm just expecting zero eight now 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.640
 but fifteen energy drink on again 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.010
 tomorrow's product base you can taste it 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.160
 so easy to get out of here for the first time 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.340
 yes gummi bear juice normal 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.590
 Gummy bears juice a bit sweet 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.600
 maybe ticking sweeter than usual 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.460
 but goes odor totally ok Sun 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.920
 annoying says normal again and have 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.080
 Wise right so we have here 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 our normal energydrinks stuff 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.540
 Bubble from the color everything like that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.020
 how do we scan that from I say 2000 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:11.640
 other energy drinks but now for a long time 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:15.130
 expected taste test cheers yes yes yes 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:20.860
 in the first millisecond one notices 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.470
 already this brand base how would that be 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.170
 so i do not know if thats the 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.800
 energy from homer jay that's always 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.120
 so one of my favorite whey parts there 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.590
 you can taste it immediately and here 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.140
 it is the same in the first one 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.970
 Millisecond you realize that it is such a 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.970
 is whey energy brings 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.160
 otherwise jagger super was not so 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.860
 super super delicious but absolutely delicious 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.849
 okay i say a little sweet as 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.849
 I'm used to that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.290
 I somehow feel like that 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.180
 still fresh 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.440
 I do not know everything the classic 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.170
 variant but I would become him now 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.280
 I would like to describe you 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.480
 standard stuff but a bit sweet 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.610
 you a little bit more fruity and 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.610
 fresher than you are used to otherwise 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 yes I do not know why but I would 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.150
 you now so it needs you without 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.500
 to be able to identify your fruit there 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.130
 no fruit is definitely not 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.650
 variety in it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.710
 they threatened to move back and acidic aroma 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:36.220
 should be with the dye 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:40.310
 no it is the standard sort but yes yes 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.660
 very solid standard energy drink on 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.850
 I already have whey base tenth 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.620
 let's say sorry a bit fresher 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.350
 a little sweeter than usual 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.820
 i think i would like to 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.350
 I definitely buy myself again 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.970
 or if I'm in there then 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.150
 stand and the choice would have or 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:01.580
 I would certainly take that yes 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.110
 I like it so great now look forward 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.570
 I look forward to the next varieties 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.850
 because if the base places and so positive 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.580
 Come away, I'll tell you then you can 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.810
 also with the taste 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.350
 coconut pineapple is not much wrong 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.340
 do so or it will be 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.590
 I do not describe 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.610

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.610
