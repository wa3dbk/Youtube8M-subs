 I know you've got it, I read it in her face 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.490
 fi casts the actress put me go you know 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 certain faces just lose sight of them 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 even if you lose them, don't forget them 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.750
 people talk full of advice and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.570
 advises things that she herself has 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.180
 wrong finds a non-raft raft 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 just ithaca is far away and this seems not 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.879
 calms certain events have been a weapon 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.160
 on the face of calm the account of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 his karma now only a barman can 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.940
 tell me what is right 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.239
 the only alchemist who stops this taboo 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.309
 Sacrifice scams is never only sec is 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 what I was alive under the skin 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.030
 daughter I have only two friends both 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.579
 called dry by the end of a child 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.800
 the other in a bottle I believe that 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.050
 we are losing the ability to live 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.479
 life with passion to take the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.950
 responsibility for what we are 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.010
 the ability to achieve results 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.790
 and to feel satisfied with life 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.470
 existentialism often has 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.240
 treated as a philosophy of 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.010
 despair but I believe it is 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.370
 exactly the chaste knows exactly 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.370
 local mind 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.190
 we always want what we don't have a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.140
 human need to pursue it c 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.820
 we destroy not placed in the for 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.040
 show it like certain things 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.100
 you lose everything take everything up to 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.500
 the pungent rhymes are striking the roses 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.990
 like rossano the usual suspect with the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.509
 kaiser source and if I can leave 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.420
 three already said goodbye you want to understand me but not 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.700
 I know I don't understand I god to take a 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.100
 punches if I had you next to me and in a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.630
 some sense has already done it to yours 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.610
 constant and do not know 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.680
 Now I asked him which he won 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.380
 peak against myself in an answer 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.600
 if disappeared into thin air like all the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.640
 motherfuckers in this jungle 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.340
 so that I too disappear as a 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.490
 great magician will remain only smoke in a 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.890
 big lake it is true that in the world there are 6 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.840
 billions of people we are 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.300
 nevertheless what you do but the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.069
 difference makes the difference first 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 in material terms it makes the difference 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.019
 for people it opens and creates a precedent 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.030
 in short , I believe that God needs this 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.489
 understand who we should never call 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.780
 out and think of being victims of one 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.780
 concomitance of strength 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 we are always the ones who decide who we are 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.600
 who we are who we are who we are who we are 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.600
 who we are who we are
