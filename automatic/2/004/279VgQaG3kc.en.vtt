00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
flowers are also on the ends and if you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330 
flowers are also on the ends and if you
look<00:00:45.420> across<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.770> plant<00:00:46.770> there<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.190> see

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
look across the plant there you can see

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
look across the plant there you can see
all<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.940> heads<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.870> flowers<00:00:49.200> coming

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
all these little heads of flowers coming

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
all these little heads of flowers coming
back<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.940> individual<00:00:51.420> flowers

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
back which have individual flowers

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
back which have individual flowers
coming<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.670> every

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
coming out on and one at a time at every

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380 
coming out on and one at a time at every
scale<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> flair<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> some<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
scale have a flair so some some of the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
scale have a flair so some some of the
Costas<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.140> their<00:00:58.350> flowers<00:00:59.100> right<00:00:59.430> at

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
Costas will have their flowers right at

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
Costas will have their flowers right at
the<00:00:59.699> base<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.570> plant<00:01:00.809> different<00:01:01.440> shape

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the base of the plant different shape

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
the base of the plant different shape
altogether<00:01:02.039> might<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.699> green<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.180> white

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
altogether might be green with white

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.580 
altogether might be green with white
flowers<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.430> yellow<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:06.960> costs<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
flowers and yellow but this one costs a

spiral<00:01:09.030> ginger<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> few<00:01:10.470> types

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
spiral ginger and there are a few types

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
spiral ginger and there are a few types
of<00:01:10.890> spiral<00:01:11.430> ginger<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> same<00:01:12.869> as

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
of spiral ginger not all the same as

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.280 
of spiral ginger not all the same as
this<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.549> but<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.909> Costas<00:01:15.390> Stralis

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this one but this is a Costas Stralis

this one but this is a Costas Stralis
and<00:01:16.409> health<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.280> interesting<00:01:17.490> thing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and health a really interesting thing

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.210 
and health a really interesting thing
about<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.270> plant<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.619> flower<00:01:19.890> dies

off<00:01:21.200> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.650> might<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:24.330> see

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
off if you might see this one here see

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980 
off if you might see this one here see
the<00:01:25.110> flowers<00:01:25.380> died<00:01:25.830> off<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.759> here's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> dead

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the flowers died off here here's a dead

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.920 
the flowers died off here here's a dead
flower<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.299> when<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.329> flower<00:01:30.630> door

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
flower down in here when the flower door

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
flower down in here when the flower door
is<00:01:31.110> often<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.159> actually<00:01:32.340> grows<00:01:32.810> these

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
is often look it actually grows these

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350 
is often look it actually grows these
new<00:01:34.079> plants<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> weight<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.210> grows

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
new plants and the weight as it grows

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 
new plants and the weight as it grows
the<00:01:36.420> new<00:01:36.720> plants<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.520> they've<00:01:38.670> got

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the new plants and you see they've got

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.410 
the new plants and you see they've got
roots<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:40.430> if<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.759> come<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.119> closely

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
roots and all if we just come in closely

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.440 
roots and all if we just come in closely
here<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> book<00:01:43.579> roots<00:01:44.579> after<00:01:45.329> its

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
here and see the book roots after its

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840 
here and see the book roots after its
flared<00:01:45.689> there's<00:01:46.079> new<00:01:46.860> plants<00:01:47.250> form<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
flared there's new plants form on the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.960 
flared there's new plants form on the
end<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.170> weight<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.700> these

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
end and the weight this is the way these

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.289 
end and the weight this is the way these
can<00:01:51.720> multiply<00:01:52.369> not<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> problem

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can multiply not that they're a problem

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.719 
can multiply not that they're a problem
because<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.799> slowly<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> weight

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
because they do it slowly but the weight

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.340 
because they do it slowly but the weight
of<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.969> brings<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> ground
