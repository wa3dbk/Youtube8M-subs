00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 certainly the dream of the majority that plays 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.940
 gta san andreas skateboard those 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.940
 game tracks is really 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.790
 but fuck there is no skateboard in the game right? 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:27.810
 Or do we have to try to find out 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:30.720
 this in 1 more breaking - who already played 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 or plays until this Tuesday andres is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010
 that wondering what floor 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.899
 skateboarding on those clues they have in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 We really do not understand much. 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.219
 sense of having radical clues like 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.960
 The downfall of the game is that we 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.270
 possibility of skateboarding that does not 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 There is a disgust but I explain this 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.710
 skate history I have a legend in the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.539
 forums and websites related to gta san 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 andreas in fact everything that is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 related to gta san andreas listen to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.360
 legend was not a tremendous success but 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.079
 anyway many people claim to have seen such 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.090
 warm up 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 others claim to have seen a guy 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.979
 walking on the skateboard up to people still 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.590
 who says he has the right time and place 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.200
 to appear the skateboard or skaters more 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 Old is everything 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.979
 some people do not know 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.049
 to interpret things does not know 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 interpret what is there in front of them 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.119
 leaving and entering days and tals 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 The reality is that skateboarding exists in the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.210
 game is my friend and he is there in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.579
 files of the most game until 3:00 p.m. 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.049
 But for some reason there is no 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.540
 circumstance, it was blocked in the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.070
 final version of the game lost 6 'reason 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.210
 But hang on there a little bit 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.009
 I tell you 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 the reality is that it was to be used 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:48.930
 as sea we do not know if it could be 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.790
 used as transportation game we have 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.009
 a baseball bat the giant stadium 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 even and not even play it 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.329
 same month of the same rockstar universe 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.659
 works different from the universe of other 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.509
 companies 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.850
 or it would be mano time kill someone 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.859
 with skateboarding in the game, and rockstar too 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.450
 I thought so only when it came to delivering 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.610
 the final version of the game 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.129
 programmers have stuck a question 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.290
 little complicated at the time they wanted 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.269
 put the skateboard in the game after fans too 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.530
 They wanted rockstar also wanted 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.440
 supported the idea 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.080
 everybody wanted everyone but the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.200
 physics at the time did not allow 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.269
 In 2004 the rockstar does not own 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.250
 the technology enough to put 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.349
 something like a skateboarding world game 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.299
 open yet another game of the size and 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.920
 fullness of gta san andreas 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.170
 the guys have already done miracles of making a 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.379
 game of that size nor at the time in 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.200
 2004 face'm fucking shit came the 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.970
 Face take a rabbit out of top hat 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 literally because it was very strong and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.819
 Grow up really fucking even then it does not work 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.069
 nor to complain about buggy the game he 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.109
 It was really fucking time for the fuckin 'season. 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.420
 Even you have to understand that. 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.099
 but they did not give up the idea and 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.200
 they decided to just block the 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.269
 simply take the game file 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.670
 that idea is that they do not 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.620
 They gave up the dream just postponed until 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.180
 to get an Indian that would 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.329
 realize your dream and that's how 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.130
 appeared in 2006 the skateboard in the game to 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.349
 who does not know how to put in the same universe of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.880
 gt as well as a kilt work all 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.569
 Rockstar games are in the same 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.099
 universe 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.810
 but if you understand nothing of the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.370
 rockstar universe does not know check out the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.769
 video I 'll leave the link in the description 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.299
 this video and they are there and you go 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.849
 to understand a little more beauty 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.889
 anyway the skate just did not arise gta san 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.200
 andreas because physics would not allow 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.419
 but the dream of walking with him in the saints 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.730
 and not just because there are way who knows 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.650
 can see in a future update of 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.650
 have so maybe not come up because 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.169
 in 2014 physics and india and rockstar 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.090
 are maybe the best in the world then 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.730
 do not lose hope because the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.950
 rockstar always does not always listen to 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.519
 fans and guys who like games 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.519
