hi everyone this is Erin for Zolo tech
and<00:00:02.669> I<00:00:03.060> thought<00:00:03.270> we'd<00:00:03.449> take<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.629> closer<00:00:04.020> look<00:00:04.350> at

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
and I thought we'd take a closer look at

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.829 
and I thought we'd take a closer look at
the<00:00:04.740> Microsoft<00:00:05.220> Surface<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:06.210> can<00:00:06.359> see<00:00:06.569> here's

couple<00:00:10.889> different<00:00:11.309> things<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.700> far<00:00:11.910> as

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
couple different things as far as

couple different things as far as
information<00:00:12.660> goes<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.380> Wi-Fi<00:00:13.950> signal

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
information goes we have Wi-Fi signal

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
information goes we have Wi-Fi signal
battery<00:00:15.000> some<00:00:15.750> messages<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> could<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.770> from

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
battery some messages this could be from

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.700 
battery some messages this could be from
Facebook<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> couple<00:00:18.090> other<00:00:18.210> places<00:00:18.710> time

Facebook or a couple other places time

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.150 
Facebook or a couple other places time
obviously<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.490> date<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.270> slide<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.410> we're

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
obviously and date I slide it up we're

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.790 
obviously and date I slide it up we're
presented<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.060> home<00:00:24.210> screen<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:25.650> is

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
presented with the home screen this is

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
presented with the home screen this is
the<00:00:25.949> Start<00:00:26.250> screen<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.449> no<00:00:27.599> more

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the Start screen now there is no more

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
the Start screen now there is no more
Start<00:00:28.170> button<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:29.220> thought<00:00:29.400> I'd<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
Start button and I thought I'd just do a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.959 
Start button and I thought I'd just do a
general<00:00:30.300> overview<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> how<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.320> use<00:00:31.740> this

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
general overview of how you use this

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.060 
general overview of how you use this
this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.239> basically<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.590> Windows<00:00:34.770> 8

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
this is basically the same as Windows 8

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040 
this is basically the same as Windows 8
as<00:00:35.219> far<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> works<00:00:36.300> although<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
as far as the way it works although it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
as far as the way it works although it
is<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.380> Windows<00:00:37.829> 8<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.790> won't<00:00:38.910> run

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
is not Windows 8 and that it won't run

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
is not Windows 8 and that it won't run
other<00:00:39.570> versions<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> Windows<00:00:40.980> programs

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
other versions of Windows programs

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.819 
other versions of Windows programs
that's<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.020> runs<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.530> ARM

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that's because it runs on an ARM

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.180 
that's because it runs on an ARM
architecture<00:00:44.300> which<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.719> x86<00:00:46.710> based<00:00:46.800> or

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
architecture which is not x86 based or

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.100 
architecture which is not x86 based or
basically<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:47.910> based<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> same

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
basically it's not based on the same

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.520 
basically it's not based on the same
sort<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> processor<00:00:50.219> architecture<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.030> runs

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
sort of processor architecture that runs

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
sort of processor architecture that runs
everything<00:00:52.530> else<00:00:52.770> meaning<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.730> old<00:00:53.940> Windows

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
everything else meaning your old Windows

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
everything else meaning your old Windows
programs<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.430> move<00:00:56.610> side

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
programs so you can see we can move side

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580 
programs so you can see we can move side
to<00:00:56.940> side<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> mouse

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to side now you can do this with a mouse

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
to side now you can do this with a mouse
by<00:00:58.920> scrolling<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.789> down<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
by scrolling up and down if you have the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
by scrolling up and down if you have the
keyboard<00:01:01.440> dock<00:01:01.859> attached<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> surface<00:01:02.699> or

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
keyboard dock attached to the surface or

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.429 
keyboard dock attached to the surface or
you<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.210> Windows<00:01:03.539> 8<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you have Windows 8 it's going to be the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.520 
you have Windows 8 it's going to be the
same<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.610> move<00:01:05.880> side<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> side<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.350> want

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
same this move side to side if we want

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
same this move side to side if we want
to<00:01:07.619> move<00:01:07.740> something<00:01:08.040> around<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:09.119> could<00:01:09.240> tap

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to move something around we could tap

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
to move something around we could tap
and<00:01:09.630> pull<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> move<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> around

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and pull down and we can move it around

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
and pull down and we can move it around
I<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.180> move<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:13.340> move<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> over

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I can move it over here move it over

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.330 
I can move it over here move it over
here<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> couple<00:01:16.350> options<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> tap

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
here I have a couple options if I tap

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.880 
here I have a couple options if I tap
and<00:01:17.580> drag<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.590> I'll<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
and drag down you can see I'll do that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
and drag down you can see I'll do that
again<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> larger<00:01:23.090> smaller<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
again we can make it larger smaller and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.920 
again we can make it larger smaller and
you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.460> most<00:01:26.729> tiles<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.420> every

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you can do that for most tiles not every

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
you can do that for most tiles not every
tile<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.799> supports<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.820> want

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
tile actually supports that if you want

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
tile actually supports that if you want
to<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.450> everything<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> pinch<00:01:31.619> out

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to see everything here we can pinch out

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
to see everything here we can pinch out
we<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.250> move<00:01:32.400> these<00:01:32.640> whole<00:01:32.909> groups<00:01:33.270> around<00:01:33.570> we

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
we can move these whole groups around we

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.020 
we can move these whole groups around we
can<00:01:34.020> name<00:01:34.320> them<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.759> too<00:01:35.820> much

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
can name them not going to go too much

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
can name them not going to go too much
into<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> wanted<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.009> show<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> is

into that what I wanted to show you is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.010 
into that what I wanted to show you is
how<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.610> use<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.390> most<00:01:39.600> people<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.960> I
