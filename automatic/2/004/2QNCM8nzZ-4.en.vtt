 I explain the results that rockstar has 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.590
 put before that shore area is a tweet 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.529
 in which he said that the best game 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.969
 that made people to create a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.890
 capture item as you can see where it is 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.170
 available to create capture that already its 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.489
 video is good just yesterday that what 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.479
 I went up at night because he uploaded a video 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.249
 saying that what was available was 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.589
 capture is worth then good rockstar has 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.989
 put a tweet which says that the 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.909
 game that captures more 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.710
 cool or cool is the first 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.030
 game checked in the game and it 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.859
 will take the creator of that game a 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.120
 million dollars worth I know there's a lot 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.319
 people who do not work the tricks that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.149
 they are still weighing in gta 5 and that 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.319
 is super need of money so 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.639
 this is going to come super good and 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.989
 as you already know to create a game of 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.459
 capture we do not need any money 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.750
 so this can be done by all 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.610
 world so it's a very very opportunity 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.110
 very good since there are so many people that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.010
 You will have seen that raffle but it says valley 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.540
 so that bill for what 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.280
 if a lot of people are going to participate 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.240
 Well, not because everyone thinks that 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.800
 everyone thinks they will participate 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 a lot of people and in the end everyone 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 ends up participating the 10 and the 14 that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.550
 involved some will be that it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.290
 carry not then few guys in the 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.600
 only requirement to do things 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.130
 verify dominance in the game 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.050
 of capture and to be able to choose to take 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.340
 the million dollars that was a lot 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.660
 of money because the only thing you have to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.610
 to do is to enter what is most someone 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.870
 the creator of capture and the only 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.640
 requirement as I tell you is the following 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.650
 it's worth here in details of capture where 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 they put labels you have to put what 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.830
 Next, we'll have lied so that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have to put pad and we put 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.060
 October as 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.430
 so you can see it well uy that there 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 You see, capture 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.840
 weekend also written effectively 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.010
 catch weekend yes yes yes what puts it 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.540
 just like this with the tweet 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.740
 so basically that is really unique 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.060
 requirement once you have each time 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.190
 this and the only thing he has to do is 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.110
 nothing then that there is your good departure 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.790
 it's your capture and then what 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.650
 create the most original possible coolest 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.940
 possible and as I say there are very few people 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.260
 that I will surely do so 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.970
 I recommend you do it because 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.800
 It surely takes about 10 20 minutes 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.410
 to a game of these well done and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.360
 surely as you carry the prize 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.590
 if you do it very well it has not been a 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.209
 boy basically that has been all there will be 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.620
 of a pretty short video as I say 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.640
 but that will serve you well 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.810
 utility since good if it takes it 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.040
 someone of you if he takes it 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.600
 someone who has seen this video 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.470
 thanks to this video the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.450
 prize so I put it for the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.709
 comments and given by the project to
