 the match in quebec in august 1990 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.669
 in what is the share is the instinct of survival of his career in Quebec 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.570
 it is a gamble as proof we learned a lot in quebec which has a 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 very very very prolific career 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.920

 five Quebecers insists me typically Quebecers in the running 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 and so early on what sort of thing is better than others when we are 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.500
 right here 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.330
 % and 18% 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.050
 fear that we consider them as can now reach its period 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.310
 classic ie from 1950 to 1960 and kennedy 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.420
 what to understand is that jean-paul lemieux 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.060
 % and in proto day not the same way 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 e early in his career it could not be assembled anymore worth it on 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.350
 mead for fat on the other hand when we talk about naïve patients because it's 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.440
 associated with own actions of academic training a bo5 but 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.410
 it was not the code jean-paul launay who had a very strong training a 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.960
 beautiful meaning and its period classified 1959 cents or 5 pence 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 in net withdrawal good overview of what it can represent by then with its 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.520
 works 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.060
 % enough euros 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 in near the visual composition is very very very purified e mullet the game 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.119
 of colors to the selection of colors as special we find 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.930
 a lot of color by a boron blain baïji concrete 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.980
 heavy rains are credited 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.510
 so the landscapes the horizons 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.160
 the way jean-paul lemieux composes his paintings it's true we scored 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.860
 by d the horizontal canvas place said 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.050
 about vertical canvases at the site 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.490
 but he holds his production it's really worth it and his hands 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.140
 especially when jean-paul lemire it's not good for an exhibition that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.320
 it's a retrospective but it's really an exhibition that lie 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.160
 the climax of jean-paul lamy in his production we are lucky to have to 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.500
 three as a poor internship a contest the art of visiting the exhibition on 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.449
 jean-paul lemieux 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.989
 so the museum shop 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.989
 % and the inn the good mine and the mansion of the lake william 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.199
 in front of% and prices and we avoid every ten godfathers will like cutting 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.609
