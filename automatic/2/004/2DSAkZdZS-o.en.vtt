00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 so connected shorter high beam here to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:12.240
 we will check this source to him 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:19.279
 including the power supply voltage I put 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.779
 about 12 volts at 12 volts 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 the current is 16 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:32.270
 now reread it turns out 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 consumption is a little over 19 here 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 pretty decent shines a little 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:50.149
 by the way so now is lowering second 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.149
 stresses 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 Here at 9 volts and already have all these 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.750
 day is dimmer 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:20.010
 from 9 to 16 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 In principle, it does not change brightly at all 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:45.990
 also eat they eat at least 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:48.320
 hood and a big thing like that again 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.460
 such LEDs 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 dazzle 33 wadded on the far 210 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:05.790
 and water lenses are worth 8 joyful general 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 he connects so sweet come on 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:17.640
 the heatsink size is good per click and 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:22.670
 staggering almost a bit so not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:26.730
 nothing melts here 1 season departure 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.750
 such a thing one power supply from 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 this is where is where is plus where is minus 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.900
 notation on the far too 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.520
 just the headlamp seat is plugged in
