and<00:00:00.120> as<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:01.050> said<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> kinetic<00:00:02.550> we

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
and as I said we're going to kinetic we

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.579 
and as I said we're going to kinetic we
determined<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.510> actually<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:04.560> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
determined that we're actually that the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
determined that we're actually that the
physiology<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.730> cell<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.150> controlled<00:00:06.839> by

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
physiology of the cell is controlled by

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.040 
physiology of the cell is controlled by
our<00:00:07.429> our<00:00:08.429> perceptions<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.480> world<00:00:09.510> and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
our our perceptions of the world and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.799 
our our perceptions of the world and
then<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> said<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.219> there<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.910> two<00:00:12.179> minds<00:00:12.690> that

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
then I said but there are two minds that

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
then I said but there are two minds that
are<00:00:12.870> operating<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> conscious<00:00:14.160> one

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
are operating here the conscious one

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.670 
are operating here the conscious one
which<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.120> really<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.839> spirit

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
which is really like the spirit

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.790 
which is really like the spirit
involving<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:18.000> our<00:00:18.240> experiences<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> spirit

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
involving with our experiences a spirit

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560 
involving with our experiences a spirit
like<00:00:19.980> putting<00:00:20.670> their<00:00:20.880> hands<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> wheel

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
like putting their hands on the wheel

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.840 
like putting their hands on the wheel
and<00:00:21.869> using<00:00:22.560> our<00:00:22.619> life<00:00:22.859> experiences<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.699> learn

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
and using our life experiences to learn

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.870 
and using our life experiences to learn
how<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> drive<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> car<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:26.099> there's<00:00:26.310> someone<00:00:26.640> or

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
how to drive a car so there's someone or

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.519 
how to drive a car so there's someone or
some<00:00:27.090> sense<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.019> doing<00:00:28.289> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
some sense of what we're really doing in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.019 
some sense of what we're really doing in
consciousness<00:00:28.890> we're<00:00:29.160> driving<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> vehicle

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
consciousness we're driving the vehicle

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780 
consciousness we're driving the vehicle
ourselves<00:00:30.420> yeah<00:00:31.070> eighty-five<00:00:32.070> percent<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
ourselves yeah eighty-five percent of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
ourselves yeah eighty-five percent of
our<00:00:33.260> functions<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.380> activities<00:00:34.440> are

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
our functions and activities are

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.020 
our functions and activities are
essentially<00:00:35.340> carried<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.760> by<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
essentially carried out by the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.450 
essentially carried out by the
subconscious<00:00:36.719> mind<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.980> significance

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
subconscious mind and the significance

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
subconscious mind and the significance
about<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.450> observe<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.350> when

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
about that is we don't observe that when

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
about that is we don't observe that when
it's<00:00:40.800> happening<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.760> subconscious

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's happening and that subconscious

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
it's happening and that subconscious
mind<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.079> even<00:00:43.320> programmed<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.129> us<00:00:44.340> it's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
mind is not even programmed by us it's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.779 
mind is not even programmed by us it's
actually<00:00:44.850> programmed<00:00:45.629> by<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.980> people<00:00:47.670> who

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
actually programmed by the people who

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
actually programmed by the people who
taught<00:00:48.149> us<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.570> early<00:00:48.930> life<00:00:49.170> experiences

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
taught us our early life experiences

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
taught us our early life experiences
from<00:00:50.010> before<00:00:50.520> birds<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> first<00:00:51.300> six

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
from before birds for the first six

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.959 
from before birds for the first six
years<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.620> conflicts<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.370> arise<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> our

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
years the conflicts that arise in our

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
years the conflicts that arise in our
lives<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.660> our<00:00:55.050> consciousness<00:00:55.949> may<00:00:56.129> be

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
lives are our consciousness may be

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.750 
lives are our consciousness may be
looking<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.640> health<00:00:57.180> happiness<00:00:57.629> prosperity

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
looking for health happiness prosperity

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
looking for health happiness prosperity
but<00:00:59.760> our<00:00:59.879> subconscious<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.750> programmed

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
but our subconscious which is programmed

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.930 
but our subconscious which is programmed
by<00:01:01.320> somebody<00:01:01.680> else<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.129> operating<00:01:02.820> our

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the web about conscious parenting is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.109 
the web about conscious parenting is
that<00:01:21.740> when<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.100> talk<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> child<00:01:23.880> less<00:01:24.090> than

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that when we talk to a child less than

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.120 
that when we talk to a child less than
six<00:01:24.479> years<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.780> age<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.409> brain<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.920> designed

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
six years of age the brain is designed

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
six years of age the brain is designed
it's<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> child's<00:01:27.750> brain<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.110> not

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's that the child's brain is not

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
it's that the child's brain is not
functioning<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.310> EEG<00:01:29.729> range<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.420> active

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
functioning in the EEG range of active

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
functioning in the EEG range of active
consciousness<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.250> lower

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
consciousness it's actually lower

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
consciousness it's actually lower
activity<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> called<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> hypnagogic

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
activity which is called the hypnagogic

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.130 
activity which is called the hypnagogic
state<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.090> reason<00:01:36.420> why<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.720> important

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
state and the reason why it is important

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
state and the reason why it is important
is<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> child<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> learn<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> rules

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
is the child has to learn all the rules

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520 
is the child has to learn all the rules
to<00:01:38.700> fit<00:01:38.850> into<00:01:39.000> society<00:01:39.180> doesn't<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.350> enough

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to fit into society doesn't have enough

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
to fit into society doesn't have enough
conscious<00:01:40.950> experience<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> contribute<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
conscious experience to contribute to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170 
conscious experience to contribute to
those<00:01:42.840> rules<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> brain<00:01:44.490> EEG

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
those rules and so the brain EEG

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.310

community wholeness and I change the
money<00:04:25.360> follows<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.930> advert<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.710> people<00:04:27.070> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
money follows the advert the people and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.749 
money follows the advert the people and
and<00:04:28.750> that's<00:04:28.930> why<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.280> medical<00:04:30.280> industry<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.699> a

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
and that's why the medical industry is a

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.909 
and that's why the medical industry is a
little<00:04:30.970> concerned<00:04:31.330> because<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.919> alternative

all about and that's the failing point

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.550 
all about and that's the failing point
that<00:05:12.580> we<00:05:12.759> experience<00:05:13.330> in<00:05:13.509> our<00:05:13.690> world<00:05:14.289> today

that we experience in our world today

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.649 
that we experience in our world today
especially<00:05:14.979> here<00:05:15.460> in<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.639> states<00:05:15.909> is<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
especially here in the states is the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.159 
especially here in the states is the
loss<00:05:16.900> of<00:05:17.139> community<00:05:17.710> which<00:05:17.949> really<00:05:18.610> was

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
loss of community which really was

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.510 
loss of community which really was
characteristic<00:05:20.169> of<00:05:20.289> the<00:05:20.860> state's<00:05:21.159> night<00:05:21.430> you

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
characteristic of the state's night you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.180 
characteristic of the state's night you
know<00:05:21.639> 50<00:05:22.030> years<00:05:22.060> ago<00:05:22.599> where<00:05:23.320> you<00:05:23.710> could<00:05:23.889> feel

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
safe in the community and now that's

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.100 
safe in the community and now that's
even<00:05:27.970> broken<00:05:28.180> down<00:05:28.419> that<00:05:28.599> we<00:05:28.690> don't<00:05:28.840> even<00:05:28.930> have

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
even broken down that we don't even have

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.520 
even broken down that we don't even have
community<00:05:30.099> within<00:05:30.280> family<00:05:30.880> anymore<00:05:31.120> that's<00:05:32.110> a

d evolution in a sense than you're right
that<00:05:35.530> we<00:05:36.310> really<00:05:36.610> have<00:05:36.729> to<00:05:36.789> come<00:05:37.030> back

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
that we really have to come back

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.270 
that we really have to come back
together<00:05:37.449> to<00:05:37.720> respect<00:05:38.349> one<00:05:38.500> another<00:05:38.770> know<00:05:39.039> who
