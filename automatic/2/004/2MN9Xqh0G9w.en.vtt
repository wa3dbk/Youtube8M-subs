00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.129
 that was not done to it's 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.409
 she also noticed German yet when comes the moment of 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.069
 compare their classes and another without additives 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.550
 they will be able to be proud of the result 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.550
 prefer 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.609
 it looks like you like 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.829
 There is no photo 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.079
 and for the consumer either 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.910
 but what exactly do we find in these additives 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.790
 that make light products 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 and are we sufficiently informed about their composition 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 it's david lined a few kilometers from brussels 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.780
 that we went looking for the answers 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.800
 at the end of this industrial zone 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200
 hides a very discreet factory 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.380
 subsidiary of one of the largest European chemical groups 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 the most used additives are manufactured by the industry 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.770
 the whole case 141 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.030
 more commonly called 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.140
 gelatin 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.400
 and the commercial manager of the machined 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.080
 Michel van den Berghe 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.890
 is proud to show us 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 everything you can do with its miracle product 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.070
 so how are these few examples 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.770
 the principal education of a salaried college 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 his burial for the food sector is 2% per year lucasfilm 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.310
 at the World level 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.750
 to succeed the doubled in the middle I judged the first market for him what 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.820
 are the pez candies 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.840
 but we also find Latin 4 in pharmaceutical capsules of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 photo dandruff 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660
 and even shampoos 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.960
 me then for 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.070
 announcements from his partner 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.010
 but for that 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.490
 you have to produce more and more 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.790
 then here factory runs at full speed 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.970
 and the famous Latin by Michel van den Berghe 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.850
 here it comes out 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.850
 at the end of the chain 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.290
 the value 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.799
 it's his spaghetti 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.679
 sticking to the fingers 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.439
 that night three losers 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.549
 the back then hit the back 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.969
 the cross 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.659
 three or four days of transformation 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.059
 in the bowels of a factory or these huge vats 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.209
 filled with acid and boiling water 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.209
 make a dampness prevail 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.619
 and in the middle of this stuffy atmosphere 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.549
 there is a detail that strikes the visitor 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:38.709
 and who enters 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.709
 to the most protected premises of the factory 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:53.889
 a pungent smell 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.829
 the city of burned grotto 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.889
 who floats on the whole site 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.339
 to the outside of the machined 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:02.179
 and the reason for this smell 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.229
 there she is 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:05.659
 it's the material 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.749
 with which gelatin is made 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.249
 to the saq through 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.899
 Japan by the voice of propaganda 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.429
 the flora of the pork skin arriving by whole pallets in its factory 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.539
 a raw material that costs him almost nothing 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.539
 and they buy all over Europe 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.229
 despite these templates 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.159
 see 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.719
 and every day 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.339
 almost 150 tons of pork rind 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.109
 tend to hangar 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.599
 to be devoured by a steel monster 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.629
 evocative name 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.629
 dino e russian 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:56.859
 thanks to this raw material for walking 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.269
 michel van den berghe manages to sell Latin know to less than 5 euros the 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.089
 kilo 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.469
 an unbeatable price 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.099
 which constantly opens up new markets 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.459
 as soon as the one who works well right now 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.649
 it is precisely the light products market 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:13.529
 everything is not perfect but it paid off 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.999
 I find 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.379
 here are partners 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.729
 ouattara must lighten 40% 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 to learn how to choose between on the terrace 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.649
 and at home always at the problem the biggest brands in assen 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.650
 in brand danone taillefer 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.740
 roussely and jo or the unemployed 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.069
 here is a fly the necessary steps 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.110
 then a product for the next hours 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.499
 for patrick jouin fat 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.069
 so to stabilize the product 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.069
 thomas kienzle we found the products or victims 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.659
 a product that manufacturers do not hesitate to use in large 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.759
 amount 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.050
 the only problem 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.999
 I know he sometimes forgets to write it on the labels 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.939
 when we look at them we read the gelatin 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.939
 born at the origin of the product 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.069
 he shot me but distanced the origin of the gelatin why 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.469
 I'm not from when is that the problem they were with 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.469
 we with that 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.149
 in fact afterward to the promise made at this age it's a 

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:22.469
 very sensitive subject 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.169
 asus still has priority 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.050
 the Jewish Muslim community and others 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.830
 with the problem launch with that 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.199
 and it would be disappointing when they go to Paris she is super disappointed 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.729
 by his troops 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.249
 the solution 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:39.839
 it is true that a lot 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.839
 because suddenly it goes from the port of marseille to apply 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.219
 this program provides for 14 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.229
 a question 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.599
 that they leave michel van den berg voiceless 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.449
 and to which no agrifood brand has wished 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:56.300
 reply 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.879
 despite our many requests 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.489
 to believe that pork gelatin is a subject he prefers to stay 

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:03.059
 discreet
