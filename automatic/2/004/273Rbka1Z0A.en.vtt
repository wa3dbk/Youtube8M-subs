00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello comrades with you freedoms and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 today we will expand our horizons 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 and in the usual diet in addition to SWAPO 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 also include retro cars 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 retro theme in general is very interesting because 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.100
 This is another era including the fact that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.039
 concerns aesthetics and brightest difference in 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.180
 fashion of different times and lustration example 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.519
 from a big movie 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.369
 take the spaceship in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.010
 presenting modern cinema 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.860
 This sensor is a touchscreen and overall full 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 ipad iphone and android 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.410
 remember how this video in the 60s and 70s 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.789
 years of the last century flashing lights 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.520
 copper wires 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.219
 skewed yes but it is very cool 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 imbalance and the same bias occurs in 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 the head of a modern motorist 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 when he met with some well 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.430
 own card and for this purpose 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.469
 and came to the oil garage to you 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 introduce one very interesting 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.840
 retro copy and reveal all of it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.060
 curious little chips and so here she is 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 car that interests us chevrolet 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.229
 78 year old corvette stingray c3 generation 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.570
 In my opinion one of the most beautiful 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.729
 ever released corvettes what 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 Motor Tudi forced up to 180 horse 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.079
 forces yes it is sad but this machine is a child 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.030
 very cruel in time in the 70s as 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.310
 we know the fuel crisis struck which 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.100
 hit hard by American power 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.130
 motors just like cops 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 grab twisted street gangsters 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.439
 fetters and handcuffs are on the street and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.149
 they nevertheless come with a feeling of complete 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.470
 moral superiority 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.020
 raised high 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.900
 bad is all friends really 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.510
 history anyone can open wikipedia and 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.970
 there to familiarize us with it this machine 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.980
 Interests as a person and a person as 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.290
 you can see this interesting and 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.120
 charismatic so get to know her 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.460
 closer 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.979
 man let shake your sleek strong 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.620
 hand dick cap trade and what 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:20.670
 cool de drive and not here so here 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.430
 we will not go far we must adapt 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.790
 somewhere and here we are friends 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.130
 faced with retro chip 1 on which the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.990
 we said at the very beginning that's what 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.350
 here the trunk outside it opens and 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.010
 to remove the removable roof panel to us 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:45.780
 will have to fold 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:47.420
 driver's seat put in there and this 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 friends are just the beginning of the main cluster 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.510
 noteworthy mulik she in the cabin at all 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.519
 view of the cabin of his stern then pretty 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.080
 peculiar no sports 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.239
 functionality of course speech and not 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 There is a sports entourage here 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.440
 present in full growth created in 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.239
 including this incredibly stylish 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.620
 front panel that rolls on 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.530
 you are like a sea wave 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 Yes, I just feel like Chris Tucker 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.920
 with the only difference that I'm not black 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.410
 seriously enough that rush hour film he 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.410
 issued on a black number to a strand 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.250
 don't need a curtsy of course it's great well 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.730
 how are things with tactile 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.350
 feelings of what to say in 70 years 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.930
 American men these were 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.510
 really stuck and brutal men 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.010
 I feel it when I try to fold 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.010
 Sunshield 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:57.340
 requires male effort when i click 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.440
 on the button on the selector machine when i 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.780
 shift paddles 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.030
 you play and it makes all sounds straight 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.540
 anturage and when you touch it and 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.570
 you move just replace now wanted 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.390
 to share a typical Americanism s 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.800
 for example to guess how emergency gang works 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.640
 but as follows to enable 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.390
 push this button 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.540
 and to activate it here it is 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.070
 again with the male effort the light 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:39.080
 This is how the chair turns into games. 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:41.790
 American wipers bred on here 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.440
 such a switch 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.510
 Adjustable pause this wheel well 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.320
 Castle 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.060
 use but very uncomfortable no well 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.010
 just look at the feeling that 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.700
 did not under the human hand and under 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.360
 claw of doctor zoidberg 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.740
 and of course our favorite trick 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.310
 this car to boot 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.630
 again in a whole collection of american you 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:15.710
 Smith Rack Thanks 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.700
 for example, here jefferson starship is 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.720
 not acid jefferson glue but come down 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.950
 you guess where it should be stuck to 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.950
 played music 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.370
 hundred 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.509
 Well, finally start the engine 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.310
 nominally here goes 180 horsepower 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.310
 but roar on all 400 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.860
 Well, it turns out that the main difference 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.810
 classics from some modern 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.419
 machines she is not so much technical 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.040
 how much all the same aesthetic if you 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.410
 liked the video and you would like to see 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.540
 more information and the other angles 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.639
 write about it in the comments as well, 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.120
 bye thanks for watching new 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.750
 meeting 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.750
 but
