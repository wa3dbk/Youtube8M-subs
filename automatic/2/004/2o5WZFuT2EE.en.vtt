00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.890 

taking<00:00:06.010> the<00:00:06.100> floor<00:00:06.370> here<00:00:07.210> so<00:00:07.420> you<00:00:07.510> can<00:00:07.660> see<00:00:07.870> a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
taking the floor here so you can see a

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.750 
taking the floor here so you can see a
little<00:00:08.080> bit<00:00:08.290> of<00:00:08.440> the<00:00:08.530> inside<00:00:08.680> this<00:00:09.400> is<00:00:09.610> the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
little bit of the inside this is the

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.470 
little bit of the inside this is the
center<00:00:11.640> channel<00:00:12.640> where<00:00:12.790> they<00:00:12.940> really<00:00:13.210> want<00:00:13.420> a

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
center channel where they really want a

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.470 
center channel where they really want a
lot<00:00:13.690> of<00:00:13.720> wires<00:00:14.050> to<00:00:14.470> run<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:15.880> a<00:00:15.910> few<00:00:16.180> problems

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
lot of wires to run got a few problems

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.210 
lot of wires to run got a few problems
with<00:00:16.869> it<00:00:17.020> not<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.439> least<00:00:17.590> of<00:00:17.800> which<00:00:17.860> is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
with it not the least of which is

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.670 
with it not the least of which is
there's<00:00:18.400> your<00:00:18.580> control<00:00:18.970> arm<00:00:19.270> and<00:00:19.990> as<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:20.560> can

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
there's your control arm and as you can

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.029 
there's your control arm and as you can
see<00:00:20.740> there<00:00:21.100> they<00:00:21.460> have<00:00:21.699> you<00:00:21.850> put<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.890> bushing<00:00:23.890> in

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
see there they have you put a bushing in

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.790 
see there they have you put a bushing in
there<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:25.210> so<00:00:25.570> all<00:00:25.869> your<00:00:26.080> wires<00:00:26.289> running<00:00:26.619> out

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
there and so all your wires running out

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.470 
there and so all your wires running out
to<00:00:26.920> the<00:00:26.949> ring<00:00:27.190> have<00:00:27.400> to<00:00:27.490> make<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.670> 90-degree

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
to the ring have to make a 90-degree

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
to the ring have to make a 90-degree
turn<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.430> then<00:00:30.430> follow<00:00:30.760> down<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.240> channel

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
turn and then follow down the channel

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.939 
turn and then follow down the channel
it's<00:00:33.430> too<00:00:33.580> much<00:00:33.730> of<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.940> chance<00:00:34.210> there<00:00:34.540> I<00:00:34.570> think

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
it's too much of a chance there I think

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.889 
it's too much of a chance there I think
that<00:00:35.949> that<00:00:36.160> wire<00:00:36.730> is<00:00:37.030> gonna<00:00:37.149> interfere<00:00:37.540> with

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
that that wire is gonna interfere with

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.180 
that that wire is gonna interfere with
that<00:00:38.020> control<00:00:38.440> there's<00:00:38.680> another<00:00:38.890> problem

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
that control there's another problem

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.090 
that control there's another problem
over<00:00:39.670> here<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.380> can<00:00:41.530> see<00:00:41.739> where<00:00:41.950> I've

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
over here that is you can see where I've

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.630 
over here that is you can see where I've
got<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.700> bushings<00:00:43.149> running<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.190> from<00:00:45.520> the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
got the bushings running out in from the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.720 
got the bushings running out in from the
wing<00:00:45.850> for<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.390> strobe<00:00:46.989> wire<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.430> moat

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
wing for the strobe wire there's a moat

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.330 
wing for the strobe wire there's a moat
that<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.480> build<00:00:49.719> that<00:00:50.500> goes<00:00:50.680> on<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.950> back<00:00:51.100> of

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
that you build that goes on the back of

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.569 
that you build that goes on the back of
the<00:00:51.399> 704<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.260> means<00:00:53.530> it's<00:00:53.950> really

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
the 704 and that means it's really

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.630 
the 704 and that means it's really
really<00:00:55.390> difficult<00:00:55.600> for<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:57.100> wire<00:00:57.340> to<00:00:57.550> get

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
really difficult for the wire to get

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.240 
really difficult for the wire to get
around<00:00:57.969> that<00:00:58.210> mountain<00:00:58.450> back<00:00:58.899> into<00:00:59.440> that

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
around that mountain back into that

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
around that mountain back into that
bushing<00:01:00.789> there

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
bushing there

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
bushing there
it<00:01:02.160> could<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.370> done<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.540> seems<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.900> me<00:01:03.990> I'd<00:01:04.110> have

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it could be done it seems to me I'd have

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.600 
it could be done it seems to me I'd have
to<00:01:04.410> provide<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.980> sort<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.309> shaping

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to provide some sort of shaping

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
to provide some sort of shaping
protection<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.510> however<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:07.980> I'm

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
protection there however and so I'm

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.060 
protection there however and so I'm
going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> look<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.640> another<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.300> this

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
going to look for another way to do this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.290 
going to look for another way to do this
besides<00:01:11.070> making<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.610> hard<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.000> turn

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
besides making that hard right turn

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.380 
besides making that hard right turn
there<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.690> control<00:01:13.050> arm<00:01:13.580> may<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.610> exposing

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
there that control arm may be exposing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560 
there that control arm may be exposing
the<00:01:15.900> wire<00:01:16.250> down<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.760> passenger<00:01:18.540> side

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the wire down at the passenger side

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.900 
the wire down at the passenger side
stick<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.650> may<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.920> interfering<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
stick and may be interfering with that

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.080 
stick and may be interfering with that
part<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.570> control<00:01:21.960> arm<00:01:22.700> okay<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:23.850> here's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
part of the control arm okay now here's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
part of the control arm okay now here's
the<00:01:24.180> destination<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the destination right here this is the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.730 
the destination right here this is the

Whelan Comet six system six whatever it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.180 
Whelan Comet six system six whatever it
is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.150 
is
Stroeve<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:30.450> I've<00:01:30.660> mounted<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.860> behind

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
Stroeve which I've mounted just behind

that vans cells and know that rudder

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
that vans cells and know that rudder
cable<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.830> doesn't<00:01:41.280> interfere<00:01:41.580> with<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
cable really doesn't interfere with it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.639 
cable really doesn't interfere with it
although<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.479> may<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:43.020> some<00:01:43.229> shaping

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
although I may put some shaping

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.190 
although I may put some shaping
protection<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.340> there

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
protection on there

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.230 
protection on there
as<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:45.950> can<00:01:46.039> see<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.460> wires<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.000> come

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
as you can see the wires have to come

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.660 
as you can see the wires have to come
out<00:01:47.680> here<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:48.909> then<00:01:49.909> somehow<00:01:50.210> end<00:01:50.570> up<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:52.490> that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
out here and then somehow end up in that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.690 
out here and then somehow end up in that
center<00:01:53.060> channel<00:01:53.860> again<00:01:54.860> without<00:01:55.070> interfering

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
center channel again without interfering

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.880 
center channel again without interfering
with<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.850> bellcrank<00:01:56.509> what<00:01:57.320> I'm<00:01:57.409> thinking<00:01:57.770> of

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
with the bellcrank what I'm thinking of

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.770 
with the bellcrank what I'm thinking of
doing<00:01:58.329> is<00:01:59.329> running<00:01:59.570> another<00:01:59.899> hole<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
doing is running another hole in a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.950 
doing is running another hole in a
bushing<00:02:02.780> under<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:04.210> baggage<00:02:05.210> compartment<00:02:05.869> on

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
bushing under the baggage compartment on

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.630 
bushing under the baggage compartment on
the<00:02:05.990> right<00:02:06.259> side<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.770> plane<00:02:07.039> for<00:02:07.429> wires

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the right side of the plane for wires

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.770 
the right side of the plane for wires
coming<00:02:08.030> out<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.269> there

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
coming out of there

wires take a heart right or a left by

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.860 
wires take a heart right or a left by
the<00:02:45.319> control<00:02:45.739> column<00:02:45.980> because<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.549> can<00:02:46.670> affect

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the control column because it can affect

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.420 
the control column because it can affect
it<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:48.019> hit<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> control<00:02:48.650> column<00:02:48.860> when<00:02:49.130> when

it can hit the control column when when

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160 
it can hit the control column when when
you're<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.760> your<00:02:49.850> full<00:02:50.150> aft<00:02:50.450> elevator

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
you're in your full aft elevator

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.890 
you're in your full aft elevator
position<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.670> what<00:02:52.819> he<00:02:52.970> did<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:53.389> kind<00:02:53.569> of<00:02:53.720> see

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
position so what he did you kind of see

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.720 
position so what he did you kind of see
it<00:02:54.019> over<00:02:54.200> there<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.500> left<00:02:54.769> because<00:02:55.549> he

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
it over there on the left because he

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.699 
it over there on the left because he
came<00:02:55.910> up<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.299> he<00:02:56.420> went<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:57.049> think<00:02:57.290> he<00:02:57.500> went<00:02:57.590> up

the<00:02:57.829> center<00:02:58.130> channel<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:59.000> he<00:02:59.090> came<00:02:59.269> out<00:02:59.329> into

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the center channel but he came out into

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.800 
the center channel but he came out into
the<00:03:00.200> under<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.769> floorboards

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the under the floorboards

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.370 
the under the floorboards
down<00:03:03.709> through<00:03:03.920> here<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.580> then<00:03:05.209> up<00:03:05.540> rather

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380

was<00:03:27.629> I<00:03:27.900> drilled<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:29.189> gets<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:30.019> 7/16<00:03:31.939> hole<00:03:32.939> not

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
was I drilled a it gets a 7/16 hole not

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.009 
was I drilled a it gets a 7/16 hole not
easy<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.110> do<00:03:34.290> here<00:03:34.879> because<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:36.180> how<00:03:36.569> close<00:03:36.840> it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
easy to do here because of how close it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.619 
easy to do here because of how close it
is<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.129> 1/4<00:03:38.909> inch<00:03:38.940> inside<00:03:39.390> diameter

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
is for a 1/4 inch inside diameter

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.569 
is for a 1/4 inch inside diameter
bushing<00:03:40.349> that's<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.590> smaller<00:03:40.890> bushing<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.489> I'm

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
bushing that's a smaller bushing but I'm

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.759 
bushing that's a smaller bushing but I'm
only<00:03:41.700> going<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:41.970> run<00:03:42.120> one<00:03:42.390> wire<00:03:42.659> it's<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
only going to run one wire it's just the

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.399 
only going to run one wire it's just the
quarter-inch<00:03:44.069> power<00:03:44.489> stroke<00:03:45.120> cable<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:46.260> then

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
quarter-inch power stroke cable and then

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.539 
quarter-inch power stroke cable and then
what<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.590> going<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.799> do<00:03:46.860> is<00:03:46.980> stagger<00:03:47.459> and

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
what I'm going to do is stagger and

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.360 
what I'm going to do is stagger and
across

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
across

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.650 
across
and<00:03:49.849> bring<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.180> up<00:03:50.269> okay<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:50.900> here's<00:03:51.230> my<00:03:51.290> chip

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
and bring it up okay so here's my chip

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.800 
and bring it up okay so here's my chip

putting your ribs in you know take a

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.270 
putting your ribs in you know take a
look<00:04:04.720> I've<00:04:05.720> staggered

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
look I've staggered

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.559 
look I've staggered
here<00:04:07.880> there<00:04:08.660> there<00:04:09.140> there<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.650> eventually<00:04:09.860> oh

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
here there there there and eventually oh

here there there there and eventually oh
it's<00:04:11.569> pretty<00:04:11.840> hard<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.380> get<00:04:12.730> well<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.790> can<00:04:13.910> get

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
it's pretty hard to get well you can get

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.940 
it's pretty hard to get well you can get
a<00:04:14.060> right-angle<00:04:14.630> drill<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.020> there<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:15.860> you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
a right-angle drill in there but you

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.349 
a right-angle drill in there but you
can't<00:04:16.160> get<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.340> unit<00:04:16.669> bit<00:04:16.790> in<00:04:16.970> there<00:04:17.150> unless

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
can't get a unit bit in there unless

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.509 
can't get a unit bit in there unless
you've<00:04:17.570> got<00:04:17.720> some<00:04:17.959> kind<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.230> nice<00:04:18.620> fancy<00:04:19.010> drill

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
you've got some kind of nice fancy drill

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.970 
you've got some kind of nice fancy drill
that<00:04:19.820> allows<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.750> unit<00:04:21.049> in<00:04:21.200> in<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.650> right<00:04:21.829> angle

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
that allows a unit in in the right angle

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.430 
that allows a unit in in the right angle
drill<00:04:22.480> so<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:23.570> might<00:04:23.720> want<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:23.960> just<00:04:24.139> figure

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
drill so you might want to just figure

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.490 
drill so you might want to just figure
out<00:04:24.500> what<00:04:24.770> your<00:04:24.950> wiring<00:04:25.160> run<00:04:25.550> for<00:04:25.790> your<00:04:25.880> stroke

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
out what your wiring run for your stroke

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.409 
out what your wiring run for your stroke
it's<00:04:27.500> gonna<00:04:27.740> be<00:04:27.889> ahead<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.220> time<00:04:28.430> another

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
it's gonna be ahead of time another

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.730 
it's gonna be ahead of time another
thing<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.900> keep<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.620> mind

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
thing to keep in mind

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.200 
thing to keep in mind
is<00:04:33.069> this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.350 

this<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> hole<00:04:37.229> that<00:04:37.740> comes<00:04:38.039> with<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:39.210> kit

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
this is the hole that comes with the kit

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.640 
this is the hole that comes with the kit
I<00:04:39.600> mean<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:39.990> where<00:04:40.139> they<00:04:40.259> want<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.560> to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
I mean this is where they want you to

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.129 
I mean this is where they want you to
run<00:04:40.830> your<00:04:40.979> wire<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:42.180> kit<00:04:42.389> pen<00:04:42.539> again<00:04:42.840> as<00:04:43.020> you

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
run your wire and a kit pen again as you

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.420 
run your wire and a kit pen again as you
can<00:04:43.289> see<00:04:43.440> before<00:04:43.620> this<00:04:44.039> is<00:04:44.160> what<00:04:44.310> would

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
can see before this is what would

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.370 
can see before this is what would
normally<00:04:44.639> get<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.180> into<00:04:45.419> trouble<00:04:45.780> because<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
normally get you into trouble because is

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.550 
normally get you into trouble because is
too<00:04:47.130> much<00:04:47.310> too<00:04:47.699> close<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.330> think<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
too much too close I think to the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.089 
too much too close I think to the
control<00:04:50.340> panels<00:04:50.789> I<00:04:51.090> put<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:51.990> right<00:04:52.020> here<00:04:52.440> as<00:04:53.039> a

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
control panels I put it right here as a

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.809 
control panels I put it right here as a
matter<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.430> fact<00:04:53.870> since<00:04:54.870> I'm<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.229> smart<00:04:55.789> when<00:04:56.789> I

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
matter of fact since I'm so smart when I

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.120 
matter of fact since I'm so smart when I
built<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.240> wings<00:04:57.449> I<00:04:57.840> put<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:58.949> in<00:04:59.099> that

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
built the wings I put that in that

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.300 
built the wings I put that in that
position<00:04:59.460> so<00:04:59.970> this<00:05:00.960> would<00:05:01.169> be<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.830> think<00:05:02.130> that's

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
position so this would be I think that's

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.450 
position so this would be I think that's
the<00:05:02.460> right<00:05:02.639> wing<00:05:02.880> there<00:05:03.979> is<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.280> left

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
the right wing there is that the left

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.279 
the right wing there is that the left
wing<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.849> can't<00:05:06.270> really<00:05:06.389> tell<00:05:06.690> but<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:06.930> can<00:05:07.139> see

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
wing I can't really tell but you can see

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.420 
wing I can't really tell but you can see
I<00:05:07.319> put<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.800> like<00:05:07.949> the<00:05:08.069> five<00:05:08.280> o'clock

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
I put it in like the five o'clock

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.820 
I put it in like the five o'clock
position<00:05:09.120> it<00:05:09.870> should<00:05:10.050> be<00:05:10.169> about<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.410> seven

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
position it should be about the seven

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.320 
position it should be about the seven
o'clock<00:05:10.919> position<00:05:11.639> once<00:05:11.820> you<00:05:11.940> put<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.210> in

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
o'clock position once you put it in

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.360 
o'clock position once you put it in
place<00:05:12.599> so<00:05:13.259> I'm<00:05:13.349> gonna<00:05:13.470> draw<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> hole<00:05:14.039> there<00:05:14.310> and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
place so I'm gonna draw a hole there and

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.070 
place so I'm gonna draw a hole there and
then<00:05:14.490> you're<00:05:14.610> gonna<00:05:14.699> see<00:05:15.419> why<00:05:15.630> that's<00:05:15.840> such<00:05:16.020> a

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
I'll just cut and only 15 feet of wire

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.930 
I'll just cut and only 15 feet of wire
stimulate<00:07:21.920> it<00:07:22.040> going<00:07:22.250> out<00:07:22.340> to<00:07:22.490> the<00:07:22.580> wing<00:07:22.760> and

I<00:07:28.930> have<00:07:29.930> manual<00:07:30.350> trip<00:07:30.650> it's<00:07:31.130> one<00:07:31.340> less<00:07:31.550> hole<00:07:32.050> to

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
I have manual trip it's one less hole to

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.320 
I have manual trip it's one less hole to
