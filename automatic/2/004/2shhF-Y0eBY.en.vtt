percent<00:01:28.650> smaller<00:01:28.830> because<00:01:29.130> nobody<00:01:29.490> these

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
percent smaller because nobody these

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.670

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.750 
console and so you take this is really I
think<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.080> being<00:01:34.290> marketed<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:35.040> almost<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
think it's being marketed as almost to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.970 
think it's being marketed as almost to
console<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.020> systems<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.710> sauna

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
console to you know systems in the sauna

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.980 
console to you know systems in the sauna
system<00:01:38.370> and<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.940> have<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.330> handheld<00:01:39.630> system

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
system and so you have a handheld system

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600 
system and so you have a handheld system
that<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.290> take<00:01:40.410> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.520> know
