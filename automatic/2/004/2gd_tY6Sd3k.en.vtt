00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
kind of turning it around here that's

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.630 
kind of turning it around here that's
pretty<00:00:28.710> neat

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.549 

how<00:00:37.180> high<00:00:37.329> can<00:00:37.360> you<00:00:37.720> go<00:00:37.870> without<00:00:38.110> hitting<00:00:38.410> the

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
how high can you go without hitting the

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.580 
how high can you go without hitting the
fans<00:00:38.800> mark

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.350 

is<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.280> too<00:00:44.430> risky<00:00:44.880> to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:47.030> in<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.150> pool

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
is it too risky to do that in the pool

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:02.690 
is it too risky to do that in the pool
room<00:00:48.570> here

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.090 

so<00:01:03.240> it's<00:01:03.450> an<00:01:03.630> autopilot<00:01:04.110> mode<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.739> I'm

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
so it's an autopilot mode right now I'm

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.700 
so it's an autopilot mode right now I'm
assuming

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:32.890 

you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.980 

that's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.050> front-facing<00:01:34.500> camera<00:01:35.870> and<00:01:36.870> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that's a front-facing camera and then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.930 
that's a front-facing camera and then
you've<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.230> a<00:01:37.440> downward<00:01:38.070> facing<00:01:38.220> camera<00:01:38.850> as

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
you've got a downward facing camera as

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.230 
you've got a downward facing camera as
well

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.510 

cool<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.470> go

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
cool there it go

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.080 
cool there it go
that's<00:01:45.520> what<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.700> looks<00:01:45.790> like<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.329> thick<00:01:46.570> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that's what it looks like I thick and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.380 
that's what it looks like I thick and
beautiful

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.149 

just<00:01:55.930> don't<00:01:56.020> land<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> lights<00:01:56.920> or
