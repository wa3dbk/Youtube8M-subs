yarn<00:00:07.570> comes<00:00:07.840> in<00:00:07.990> a<00:00:08.080> lot<00:00:08.230> of<00:00:08.260> different

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.770 
yarn comes in a lot of different

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.790 
yarn comes in a lot of different
textures<00:00:09.600> texture<00:00:10.600> can<00:00:10.809> be<00:00:10.930> achieved<00:00:11.410> by

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 
textures texture can be achieved by

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.180 
textures texture can be achieved by
mixing<00:00:12.240> different<00:00:13.350> kinds<00:00:14.350> of<00:00:14.559> yarns<00:00:14.980> together

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
mixing different kinds of yarns together

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.150 
mixing different kinds of yarns together
or<00:00:15.700> by<00:00:16.420> actually<00:00:16.900> inserting<00:00:17.440> things<00:00:17.619> into<00:00:18.070> the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
or by actually inserting things into the

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.759 
or by actually inserting things into the
yarn<00:00:18.400> something<00:00:19.330> like<00:00:19.510> this<00:00:19.780> which<00:00:20.619> almost

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
yarn something like this which almost

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.730 
yarn something like this which almost
looks<00:00:21.279> furry<00:00:21.939> or<00:00:22.300> feathery<00:00:22.720> I<00:00:23.109> think<00:00:23.590> it's<00:00:23.679> a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
looks furry or feathery I think it's a

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.980 
looks furry or feathery I think it's a
hundred<00:00:24.009> percent<00:00:24.099> rayon<00:00:24.640> but<00:00:25.599> that's<00:00:25.810> going

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
hundred percent rayon but that's going

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.749 
hundred percent rayon but that's going
to<00:00:26.050> give<00:00:26.259> you<00:00:26.410> sort<00:00:26.679> of<00:00:26.769> like<00:00:26.949> a<00:00:26.980> feathery<00:00:27.400> look

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
to give you sort of like a feathery look

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.310 
to give you sort of like a feathery look
if<00:00:27.910> you<00:00:28.029> want<00:00:28.179> to<00:00:28.269> add<00:00:28.390> it<00:00:28.539> as<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.720> trim<00:00:29.080> to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
if you want to add it as a trim to

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.519 
if you want to add it as a trim to
something<00:00:30.089> something<00:00:31.089> like<00:00:31.269> this<00:00:31.599> what

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
something something like this what

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.990 
something something like this what
they've<00:00:32.650> actually<00:00:32.860> done<00:00:33.310> is<00:00:33.670> they've<00:00:33.970> taken

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
they've actually done is they've taken

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.210 
they've actually done is they've taken
different<00:00:34.990> yarns<00:00:35.380> and<00:00:35.590> tied<00:00:35.800> them<00:00:36.040> together

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
different yarns and tied them together

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.610 
different yarns and tied them together
so<00:00:37.059> they'll<00:00:37.239> take<00:00:37.420> strands<00:00:37.930> of<00:00:38.020> wool<00:00:38.260> and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
so they'll take strands of wool and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.880 
so they'll take strands of wool and
alpaca<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.610> rayon<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.390> nylon<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:41.350> metallic

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
alpaca and rayon and nylon and metallic

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.560 
alpaca and rayon and nylon and metallic
and<00:00:42.070> they'll<00:00:42.190> tie<00:00:42.399> it<00:00:42.460> all<00:00:42.670> together<00:00:42.820> so<00:00:43.539> that

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
and they'll tie it all together so that

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.869 
and they'll tie it all together so that
as<00:00:43.870> you're<00:00:44.079> knitting<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.890> texture<00:00:45.340> sort<00:00:45.820> of

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
as you're knitting the texture sort of

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.470 
as you're knitting the texture sort of
changes<00:00:46.390> row-by-row<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:47.699> wool<00:00:48.699> like<00:00:48.969> this<00:00:49.210> is

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
changes row-by-row a wool like this is

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.170 
changes row-by-row a wool like this is
actually<00:00:50.050> wool<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.649> has<00:00:50.859> other<00:00:51.160> kinds<00:00:52.030> of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
actually wool that has other kinds of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.439 
actually wool that has other kinds of
yarn<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:52.960> textures<00:00:53.500> woven<00:00:54.100> throughout<00:00:54.399> it<00:00:54.760> so

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
yarn and textures woven throughout it so

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.500 
yarn and textures woven throughout it so
you'll<00:00:55.870> find<00:00:56.170> sort<00:00:56.859> of<00:00:56.949> metallics<00:00:57.579> maybe<00:00:58.269> some

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
you'll find sort of metallics maybe some

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.569 
you'll find sort of metallics maybe some
feathers<00:00:58.809> some<00:00:59.019> sequins<00:00:59.530> some<00:00:59.949> sparkles

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
feathers some sequins some sparkles

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.910 
feathers some sequins some sparkles
it'll<00:01:01.210> change<00:01:01.510> as<00:01:01.780> you're<00:01:01.960> knitting<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.440> but

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
it'll change as you're knitting it but

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.710 
it'll change as you're knitting it but
it's<00:01:03.039> all<00:01:03.250> woven<00:01:03.789> throughout<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.180> yarn<00:01:04.420> as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
it's all woven throughout the yarn as

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's all woven throughout the yarn as
opposed<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.730> something<00:01:06.730> like<00:01:06.760> this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
opposed to this something like this

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.600 
opposed to this something like this
actually<00:01:07.450> hat<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.410> mohair<00:01:09.040> but<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.460> actually

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
actually hat is mohair but it actually

actually hat is mohair but it actually
has<00:01:09.909> felted<00:01:10.420> balls<00:01:10.689> on<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.799> can<00:01:11.979> be<00:01:12.040> moved

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
has felted balls on it that can be moved

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.980 
has felted balls on it that can be moved
throughout<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.000> yarn<00:01:13.210> depending<00:01:13.689> on<00:01:13.780> how<00:01:13.930> you

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
throughout the yarn depending on how you

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.990 
throughout the yarn depending on how you
want<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.500> hang<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.220> can<00:01:15.400> create<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.700> cowl

as a as a cowl or baby as wrist warmers
as<00:01:33.250> an<00:01:33.340> accent<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:36.310> yarn<00:01:36.640> actually<00:01:36.970> has

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
as an accent this yarn actually has

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.030 
as an accent this yarn actually has
smaller<00:01:38.619> bits<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.909> yarn<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.259> spring<00:01:41.799> out<00:01:42.009> of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
smaller bits of yarn that spring out of

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.069 
smaller bits of yarn that spring out of
it<00:01:42.280> as<00:01:42.460> you're<00:01:42.729> knitting<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.630> you'll<00:01:43.840> knit<00:01:44.020> a

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
it as you're knitting so you'll knit a

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.530 
it as you're knitting so you'll knit a
flat<00:01:44.500> piece<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.280> then<00:01:45.549> pieces<00:01:46.210> will<00:01:46.509> start

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
flat piece and then pieces will start

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.330 
flat piece and then pieces will start
popping<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> different<00:01:48.009> colors<00:01:48.310> that

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
popping up of the different colors that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.490 
popping up of the different colors that
are<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.880> yarn<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.600> gives<00:01:49.990> your

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
are in the yarn and that gives your

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.420 
are in the yarn and that gives your
knitted<00:01:50.829> piece<00:01:51.100> texture<00:01:51.759> in<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.030> different<00:01:52.390> way

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
knitted piece texture in a different way

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.389 
knitted piece texture in a different way
this<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.640> brushed<00:01:55.000> SRI<00:01:55.509> it's<00:01:56.320> actually<00:01:56.890> baby

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
this is brushed SRI it's actually baby

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.039 
this is brushed SRI it's actually baby
sari<00:01:57.759> merino<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.680> bamboo<00:01:59.680> it<00:02:00.189> sort<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.270> knits

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
sari merino and bamboo it sort of knits

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.350 
sari merino and bamboo it sort of knits
like<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.320> cloud<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:03.100> very<00:02:03.399> very<00:02:03.670> soft<00:02:04.030> it's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
like a cloud it's very very soft it's

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.690
