00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.200
 good to all we are in the pool of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.060
 metropol in gran canarias that today we are going 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.580
 to make a competition 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.010
 and I'm going to take this opportunity to explain 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.320
 little of how outputs are made now 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.610
 I'm going to record a few outputs 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.740
 during the competition so you can see 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.060
 how the exit is made to the different 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.529
 styles especially for you to see the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.390
 difference between the output from 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.880
 up and the work output that would be 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.919
 in this case the back and more 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 further on we will explain how the 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.759
 output specifically both outside 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.710
 like inside the water in each of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.460
 the styles separately here you can see 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.680
 a poyete and basically there's 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 different types but I will tell you that when 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.440
 the referee gives a long beep that will be 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.840
 cpp 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.420
 or else a long game the swimmer what 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.829
 what you have to do is 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.480
 avoid in advance 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.230
 well this you can not have to swim 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.149
 neither any type of bracelets 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.489
 independent nothing with long appetite 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.769
 what you have to do is go up 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.470
 of the poyete is simply worth then 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.990
 then there is the signal of the preparations in 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.360
 the one that later on and in this case already 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.610
 finally we use fingers for something 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.020
 from the feet 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.440
 We not grabbed with toes 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.170
 here in the coyote to love the word 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.260
 when you get a short cupid or a signal 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.920
 acoustic type when you have exited the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.900
 you can do it with the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.120
 leg a little more open and holding on 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.460
 with your hands to the post inside and 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.080
 you can do the opposite also with 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.270
 the legs inside together and the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 arms out or you can make the exit 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.680
 American in which you have is similar to 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.570
 the exit of athletic tacos and has 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.240
 a front foot held with the fingers of 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.760
 the feet on the edge in front and one foot 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.540
 behind in some pools the projects 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.490
 they have a kind of base here that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.750
 It can be adjustable to support the foot 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.710
 from behind to help you make a 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.710
 American outlet 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.290
 the exit angle the exit angle 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.810
 it has to be 0 degrees that is 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.910
 you have to try to take a leap with the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.160
 greater horizontality and the greater length 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.890
 can not take a leap upward 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.750
 actually this afternoon in time or 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.430
 less so they have taught me because 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.230
 as the poyete is already in height 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.030
 new you have to look for length and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.319
 outputs from below as there are many 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.569
 people for example that leave because 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.150
 they are afraid to pull themselves up so high 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.890
 therefore they do not know how to fall well or they give here 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.320
 in the house since you already have from 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.959
 down then I would not jump with an angle 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.269
 of greater inclination of about 45 degrees 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.050
 serious when we go swimming back the 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.050
 long beep he 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.749
 publish and I have to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.459
 throw to the water months and in that case we're going 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.930
 in the hunt in this case as the beep 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.769
 long throwing into the water 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.769
 I love 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.469
 this would be the signal for consciousness 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.980
 of the long world then places you here 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.540
 prepared 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.629
 the malaga I have prepared in when the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.120
 referee says prepared after version and already 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.940
 would come out here when the position transacts 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.709
 it has to have more or less two or three 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.860
 fingers knees under water 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.250
 without excelling worth each one already puts 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.959
 the height that he considers will try 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.120
 hanging with the arms stretched out 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.459
 this part of the bottom of the project when 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.440
 they were inside says prepared in that 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.110
 moment of pressure to prepare and 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.260
 then in the video because the signal 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.879
 acoustic comes out back carrying the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.319
 arms back that we'll see in 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.360
 outputs back more 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.400
 specifically and I will record both by 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.780
 out of the water 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.450
 let's do with pepe sword 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.600
 the output simulation for the pp from 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.980
 up, come, do everything 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.010
 at the exit all professional I give you the 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.280
 exit 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.180
 where low 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.180
 on the street 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.239
 but pp the back exit 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.610
 it stays down it stays there there we go 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:20.370
 let's see with pepe but 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.370
 but pepe let me give you the pp 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:30.110
 I'm supposed to have done 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.110
 and now and now prepared 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.160
 the greeting of pepe is incredible the follow 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.289
 got pp for pepe so he could see 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.210
 someone 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.710
 amazing in the middle of the street to see what 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.400
 happens 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.550
 If you look at it, it detects that you have not yet 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.550
 has seen 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.879
 very well pp 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.650
 after 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.280
 green 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.289
 the middle chest shave the electrodes 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.289
 of the holter because how have you seen 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.349
 well very well the greeting to leave when 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.710
 I depilated everything not noticeably at 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.710
 brands
