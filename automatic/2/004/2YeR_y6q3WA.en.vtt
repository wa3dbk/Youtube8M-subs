warlock<00:00:18.210> resto<00:00:18.570> shaman<00:00:18.929> has<00:00:18.990> been<00:00:19.140> my

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
warlock resto shaman has been my

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.390 
warlock resto shaman has been my
favorite<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:20.669> or<00:00:20.789> less<00:00:20.849> because<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:23.099> frost

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
favorite more or less because the frost

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.200 
favorite more or less because the frost
variant<00:00:24.019> makes<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.859> apparent<00:00:26.579> these

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
variant makes it really apparent these

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
variant makes it really apparent these
switches<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.289> pressure<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.009> heaven<00:00:29.339> flow<00:00:29.699> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
switches and pressure and heaven flow of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.749 
switches and pressure and heaven flow of
the<00:00:29.999> game<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.179> works<00:00:30.449> out<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.599> well<00:00:30.839> so

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
the game that works out really well so

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
the game that works out really well so
yeah<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.239> mean<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.780> annoying<00:00:34.079> part<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
yeah but I mean the annoying part is it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
yeah but I mean the annoying part is it
is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.039> tournament<00:00:35.309> realm<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.930> because<00:00:36.930> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
is the tournament realm and because of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.819 
is the tournament realm and because of
that<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:37.940> kicks<00:00:38.940> almost<00:00:39.300> never<00:00:39.510> hit<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.109> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that my kicks almost never hit it's a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.010 
that my kicks almost never hit it's a
full<00:00:41.460> half<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.789> cast<00:00:42.030> before<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.780> go

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
full half a cast before they actually go

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
full half a cast before they actually go
up<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.440> almost<00:00:43.590> always<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> get

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
up so it's almost always that I get

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
up so it's almost always that I get
duped<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.019> pretty<00:00:46.469> much

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
duped or not so I'm just pretty much

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.869 
duped or not so I'm just pretty much
holding<00:00:46.769> onto<00:00:47.010> kicked<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> whole<00:00:47.460> time<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
holding onto kicked the whole time and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.310 
holding onto kicked the whole time and
kicking<00:00:48.210> every<00:00:48.449> couple<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.019> don't<00:00:49.199> be

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
kicking every couple so they don't be

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
kicking every couple so they don't be
comfortable<00:00:49.769> with<00:00:49.949> me<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.250> kicking<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
comfortable with me not kicking and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.840 
comfortable with me not kicking and
that's<00:00:51.660> about<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.070> as<00:00:53.070> soon<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.519> I<00:00:53.609> got<00:00:53.730> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the pressure will come off but then we

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
the pressure will come off but then we
can<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.730> into<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> single<00:01:18.240> target<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.600> actually

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
going to be for now we're just training

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
going to be for now we're just training
the<00:01:25.890> lock<00:01:26.070> mainly<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:26.550> he<00:01:26.790> hasn't<00:01:26.910> gotten

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the lock mainly because he hasn't gotten

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.900 
the lock mainly because he hasn't gotten
really<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.750> many<00:01:27.900> dots<00:01:28.440> up<00:01:28.680> or<00:01:28.860> we're<00:01:29.850> not

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910

taking<00:01:30.240> pressure<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.690> it<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:30.930> we're

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
taking pressure from it because we're

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.300 
taking pressure from it because we're
putting<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.470> enough<00:01:31.650> pressure<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.070> the
