the<00:01:56.049> new<00:01:56.200> questions<00:01:56.770> we've<00:01:56.890> got<00:01:57.070> for<00:01:57.100> Thunder

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
the new questions we've got for Thunder

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.160 
the new questions we've got for Thunder
is<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.700> ankle<00:01:58.030> slicer<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.630> it's<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.840> low<00:01:58.990> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
is the ankle slicer so it's a low of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.200 
is the ankle slicer so it's a low of
which<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.619> really<00:01:59.890> powerful<00:02:00.159> second<00:02:00.939> it's<00:02:01.030> got

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
which is really powerful second it's got

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.969 
which is really powerful second it's got
low<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.630> vulnerability<00:02:02.259> as<00:02:02.439> it's<00:02:02.649> pointing

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
low and vulnerability as it's pointing

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.039 
low and vulnerability as it's pointing
the<00:02:03.039> way<00:02:03.210> rush<00:02:04.210> down<00:02:04.390> character<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.840> going<00:02:04.990> to

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
the way rush down character is going to

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.959 
the way rush down character is going to
be<00:02:05.109> very<00:02:05.289> afraid<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.710> them<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.490> they<00:02:06.729> try<00:02:06.909> to

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
be very afraid of them if they try to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.839 
be very afraid of them if they try to
get<00:02:07.119> in<00:02:07.179> close<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.840> they<00:02:08.470> mess<00:02:08.649> up<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:09.069> as<00:02:09.670> far

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
get in close and they mess up and as far

for me see full model looks gorgeous
extremely<00:02:16.510> powerful<00:02:16.799> what<00:02:17.799> we<00:02:17.950> were<00:02:18.160> doing<00:02:18.489> we

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
extremely powerful what we were doing we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.400 
extremely powerful what we were doing we
designed<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.299> sort<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.569> thinking<00:02:19.900> hey<00:02:20.110> as<00:02:20.349> a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
designed it is sort of thinking hey as a

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.530 
designed it is sort of thinking hey as a
graplar<00:02:20.950> character<00:02:21.400> what<00:02:21.910> would<00:02:22.060> be<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.329> one

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
graplar character what would be the one

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.300 
graplar character what would be the one
thing<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.930> want<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.709> everyone<00:02:24.220> was

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
thing you want to do and everyone was

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
thing you want to do and everyone was
like<00:02:24.430> well<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.819> want<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:25.660> his<00:02:25.870> dash

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
like well you want to get in so his dash

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.350 
like well you want to get in so his dash
moves<00:02:26.560> further<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.280> completely<00:02:28.090> invulnerable

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
moves further is completely invulnerable

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.539 
moves further is completely invulnerable
and<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.290> special<00:02:29.680> cancelled<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.340> last

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
and can be special cancelled in the last

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.479 
and can be special cancelled in the last
half<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:31.720> basically<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.410> ultimate<00:02:33.280> tool

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
half so it's basically the ultimate tool

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.580 
half so it's basically the ultimate tool
for<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> grappler<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.420> get<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.720> quotes<00:02:34.989> safely

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
for a grappler and get in quotes safely

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.860 
for a grappler and get in quotes safely
we<00:02:36.069> wanted<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> key<00:02:36.700> read<00:02:36.970> immediately<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.720> be

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
and what we wanted to do not feel

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.110 
and what we wanted to do not feel
authentic<00:03:14.170> but<00:03:14.920> recapture<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.609> little<00:03:15.880> bit<00:03:16.000> of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
authentic but recapture a little bit of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.420 
authentic but recapture a little bit of
the<00:03:16.269> original<00:03:16.780> bridge<00:03:17.530> area<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.220> you'll

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
the original bridge area so you'll

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.030 
the original bridge area so you'll
notice<00:03:18.660> there's<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.750> nice<00:03:20.019> sort<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.590> landing

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
notice there's a nice sort of landing

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.680 
notice there's a nice sort of landing
area<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.459> when<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.700> camera<00:03:22.060> zooms<00:03:22.269> out<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
area and when the camera zooms out and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.479 
area and when the camera zooms out and
get<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> beautiful<00:03:23.380> view<00:03:23.739> into<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.040> background

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
get a beautiful view into the background

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.099 
get a beautiful view into the background
so<00:03:24.639> we<00:03:24.730> didn't<00:03:24.880> get<00:03:24.970> some<00:03:25.120> nice<00:03:25.299> Amash<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:26.019> the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
so we didn't get some nice Amash to the

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.900 
so we didn't get some nice Amash to the
past<00:03:26.349> while<00:03:26.650> modernizing<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.639> keeping<00:03:27.790> it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
past while modernizing it and keeping it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.390 
past while modernizing it and keeping it
more<00:03:28.180> authentic<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.470> with<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:29.980> old<00:03:30.130> rope

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
more authentic so with the old rope

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.879 
more authentic so with the old rope

the<00:03:42.160> gamescom<00:03:42.519> build<00:03:42.970> its<00:03:43.269> it's<00:03:43.780> spiritually

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
the gamescom build its it's spiritually

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.409 
the gamescom build its it's spiritually
in<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.950> same<00:03:45.190> vein<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.760> we<00:03:46.030> wanted<00:03:46.299> to

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
in the same vein and we wanted to

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.690 
in the same vein and we wanted to
capture<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.650> epic<00:03:48.010> nature<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.549> being

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
capture just the epic nature of being

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.699 
capture just the epic nature of being
against<00:03:49.389> let<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.720> elements<00:03:50.230> being<00:03:50.410> at<00:03:50.680> a

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
against let the elements being at a

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.030 
against let the elements being at a
higher<00:03:50.950> elevation<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:52.180> fight<00:03:52.660> against<00:03:53.109> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
higher elevation to fight against the

so<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.110> believe<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.740> really<00:03:55.950> captured<00:03:56.490> that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
so I believe we really captured that

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.570 
so I believe we really captured that
essence<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.480> being<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:57.900> top<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.320> world
