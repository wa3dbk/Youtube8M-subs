00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.839 

so<00:02:46.720> yeah<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> good<00:02:49.629> look<00:02:49.780> at<00:02:49.930> my<00:02:50.019> bake<00:02:50.200> I

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
so yeah get a good look at my bake I

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:59.210 
so yeah get a good look at my bake I
guess

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.950 

so<00:02:59.850> yeah<00:03:00.000> much<00:03:00.180> better<00:03:00.420> than<00:03:00.600> my<00:03:00.720> Yamaha<00:03:01.370> it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
so yeah much better than my Yamaha it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.830 
so yeah much better than my Yamaha it's
way<00:03:03.960> more<00:03:03.990> powerful<00:03:04.940> like<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.240> were<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
way more powerful like if you were if I

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.170 
way more powerful like if you were if I
would<00:03:06.960> just<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.530> say<00:03:07.710> like<00:03:08.280> somebody<00:03:09.060> was

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
would just just to say like somebody was

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.230 
would just just to say like somebody was
getting<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> 125<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.740> would<00:03:11.430> definitely<00:03:11.820> say<00:03:12.000> get

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
getting a 125 I would definitely say get

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
getting a 125 I would definitely say get
a<00:03:12.270> KTM<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:13.490> these<00:03:14.490> things<00:03:14.700> rip<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.170> I'm

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
a KTM because these things rip so I'm

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.840 
a KTM because these things rip so I'm
assuming<00:03:16.440> all<00:03:16.710> K<00:03:16.890> teams<00:03:17.220> are<00:03:17.400> faster<00:03:17.760> than

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
assuming all K teams are faster than

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:29.120 
assuming all K teams are faster than
Yamahas<00:03:19.100> my<00:03:20.100> Yamaha<00:03:20.430> was<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.700> good<00:03:20.910> bike<00:03:28.130> so

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
Yamahas my Yamaha was a good bike so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.580 
Yamahas my Yamaha was a good bike so
yeah<00:03:31.130> that's<00:03:32.130> my<00:03:32.870> KTM<00:03:34.070> 125<00:03:35.070> SX
