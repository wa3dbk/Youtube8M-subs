00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.129
 a lifting serves to reduce the double chin 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.930
 the facelift is a surgery of the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.900
 that in recent years there is talk 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:28.369
 we have often heard of everything up 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.500
 even announce his death I would say that 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.100
 it's just the opposite what it is 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.510
 true is that patients who come to 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.950
 our query requesting a 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.879
 facial rejuvenation through a 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.100
 lifting technique are patients who in 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.100
 100% of cases are referred 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.440
 by other patients who have already been 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.079
 submitted to this type of intervention and 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.120
 that are the best guarantee for this 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.960
 type of surgery 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.359
 this is a meticulous surgery where the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.780
 surgeon has to have a broad 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.900
 experience and know how to treat tissues 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.080
 very delicately to get 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.510
 natural results there is the crux of 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.130
 the question 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.720
 It can be said that the skin is a is one of 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.040
 the tissues the widest of our 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.100
 organism that does not support very well the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.190
 tension is to say we should not stretch the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.800
 skin we must reposition the tension 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.050
 must be 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.930
 made in deeper tissues in what 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.860
 what we call the muscle fascia there 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.980
 yes we can stretch and that will give us place 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.790
 to more permanent results in the 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.060
 time and especially to that once 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.860
 stretched those deep planes the skin 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.770
 it will not need to be stretched but it will be 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.320
 repositioned in its new placement 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.270
 special mention deserves all this that 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.350
 we are saying at neck level 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.540
 where we will find muscles very 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.990
 fine in the isthmus muscle that should 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.420
 be tensed must be relocated but 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.670
 we can also find 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.640
 important to clumps of fat such as 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.310
 that give rise to a double chin that should 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.349
 be withdrawn 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.959
 not in its entirety because if the 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.680
 we removed completely skeletal 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.910
 we will do too much is to that area but 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.840
 if extirpated in its excess for 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.849
 get a lot more contours 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 harmonics with the rest of the face 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.250
 definitely the only treatment 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.290
 advisable to treat a double chin is the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.950
 realization of a facelift in 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.950
 expert hands
