I<00:01:01.720> just<00:01:02.320> talked<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.680> over<00:01:02.800> how<00:01:03.100> we're<00:01:03.370> probably

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
I just talked it over how we're probably

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.150 
I just talked it over how we're probably
about<00:01:03.940> 100<00:01:04.630> meters<00:01:04.930> under<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.200> sea<00:01:05.440> here<00:01:05.710> it's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
about 100 meters under the sea here it's

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.880 
about 100 meters under the sea here it's
mind-blowing

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.410 

some<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.220> strange<00:01:16.490> feeling<00:01:16.820> being<00:01:17.210> down

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
some really strange feeling being down

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.790 
some really strange feeling being down
here

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.680 

well<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.830> can<00:01:25.070> see<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.970> strip<00:01:26.240> lights<00:01:26.480> on

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
well I can see that the strip lights on

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.420 
well I can see that the strip lights on
the<00:01:26.780> roof<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.230> just<00:01:27.470> one<00:01:27.740> long<00:01:27.950> line<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.160> them

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
the roof and just one long line of them

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.130 
the roof and just one long line of them
almost<00:01:28.970> feels<00:01:29.330> like<00:01:29.540> I'm<00:01:29.660> on<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> bit<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
almost feels like I'm on a bit of a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.180 
almost feels like I'm on a bit of a
conveyer<00:01:30.530> belt<00:01:32.260> this<00:01:33.260> could<00:01:33.530> be<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.680> really

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
conveyer belt this could be a really

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:48.919 
conveyer belt this could be a really
really<00:01:34.520> cool<00:01:34.730> stage<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.450> race

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.020 

it's<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.079> final<00:01:50.439> push<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.649> France<00:01:51.039> looking

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
it's the final push to France looking

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.279 
it's the final push to France looking
forward<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.450> seeing<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.780> end<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.110> tunnel

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
forward to seeing the end of this tunnel

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:12.870 
forward to seeing the end of this tunnel
now

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

hi<00:02:13.880> guys<00:02:14.180> Carly

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
hi guys Carly

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.780 
hi guys Carly
okay<00:02:16.049> are<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> rolling

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.479 

this<00:02:20.330> definitely<00:02:20.690> first<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.290> me

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
this definitely first to me

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.290 
this definitely first to me
and<00:02:22.640> kind<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.090> filming<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.230> kind<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.590> scale

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and kind of filming this kind of scale

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.320 
and kind of filming this kind of scale
so<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> definitely<00:02:26.810> feels<00:02:27.230> like

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
so it definitely feels like

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.000 
so it definitely feels like
it's<00:02:28.690> going<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> be<00:02:29.020> more<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> time<00:02:29.710> trial

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
it's going to be more like a time trial

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.310 
it's going to be more like a time trial
writing<00:02:30.460> providing<00:02:31.300> 50<00:02:31.690> kilometers<00:02:32.140> through

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
writing providing 50 kilometers through

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.970 
writing providing 50 kilometers through
the<00:02:32.500> tunnel<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.130> my

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the tunnel on my

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.500 
the tunnel on my

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.560 
UK standing in France now has really
really<00:03:26.010> weird<00:03:26.190> experience<00:03:26.880> going<00:03:27.480> through

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
really weird experience going through

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.450 
really weird experience going through
the<00:03:27.870> tunnel<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.560> almost<00:03:28.710> feel<00:03:29.070> as<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:29.340> you

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
the tunnel you almost feel as if you

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.880 
the tunnel you almost feel as if you
lose<00:03:29.670> track<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.120> distance<00:03:30.930> perception<00:03:31.650> it's

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
lose track of distance perception it's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.890 
lose track of distance perception it's
you've<00:03:32.550> got<00:03:32.730> no<00:03:32.880> nothing<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.540> gauge<00:03:33.720> yourself

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
you've got no nothing to gauge yourself

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.140 
you've got no nothing to gauge yourself
against<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:35.040> pretty<00:03:35.370> weird<00:03:35.640> but<00:03:35.790> no

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
against so it's pretty weird but no

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.910 
against so it's pretty weird but no
really<00:03:36.540> good<00:03:36.750> feeling<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.110> come<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.710> sight
