ten<00:00:20.609> eight<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.289> six<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.039> they're<00:00:23.850> pretty

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
ten eight and six so they're pretty

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.330

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
young and they drew himself so this

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.169 
young and they drew himself so this
probably<00:00:26.609> came<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:27.230> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> oldest<00:00:28.859> one

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
probably came out this is the oldest one

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.669 
probably came out this is the oldest one
and<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.869> all<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> same<00:00:31.289> color<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and we all have the same color by the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
and we all have the same color by the
way<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.949> seems<00:00:32.130> things<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.020> kind<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
way it seems things so it's kind of a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400 
way it seems things so it's kind of a
dark<00:00:34.730> color<00:00:35.730> sounds<00:00:36.420> vile<00:00:36.719> able<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.140> first

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
dark color sounds vile able to my first

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.889 
dark color sounds vile able to my first
time<00:00:37.649> using<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.579> dowel<00:00:38.820> I've<00:00:39.149> never<00:00:39.360> used<00:00:39.600> else

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
time using a dowel I've never used else

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.830 
time using a dowel I've never used else
it<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> first<00:00:40.379> time<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.629> easier

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it was the first time it's a lot easier

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.950 
it was the first time it's a lot easier
than<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.980> using<00:00:44.129> normal<00:00:44.520> wood<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:44.910> bar<00:00:45.090> but

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
than just using normal wood or bar but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
than just using normal wood or bar but
um<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
um I don't know I don't like it that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920 
um I don't know I don't like it that
much<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.239> can't<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.780> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
much because you can't really make that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.000 
much because you can't really make that
many<00:00:49.110> designs<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:51.739> consume<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.890> own

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
many designs on it or consume your own

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.470

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
this is actually from trees from a tree

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.990 
this is actually from trees from a tree
bark<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.780> meta<00:03:19.620> del<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.220> has<00:03:20.669> a<00:03:20.699> nice<00:03:20.849> little

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
bark so meta del and has a nice little

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.059 
bark so meta del and has a nice little
curve<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.449> it<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.319> what<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.530> first<00:03:22.769> did<00:03:22.919> was

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
curve to it and what I first did was

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.949 
curve to it and what I first did was
that<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.459> kind<00:03:23.729> of<00:03:23.819> just<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.479> suggest<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
that I kind of just this is suggest the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.780 
that I kind of just this is suggest the
way<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.169> was<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.680> found<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.280> then<00:03:26.310> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
way it was when I found it and then I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.020 
way it was when I found it and then I
stripped<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.659> then<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:29.280> first<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.790> was

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
stripped it and then at first I was

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.869 
stripped it and then at first I was
little<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:31.290> spiral<00:03:31.949> curve<00:03:32.250> all<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.790> way

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
little a spiral curve all the way

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.830 
little a spiral curve all the way
through<00:03:33.060> sit<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.109> see<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:36.209> made<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
through sit you can see and I made a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.629 
through sit you can see and I made a
darker<00:03:37.229> inside<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.829> lighter<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> outside

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
darker inside and lighter on the outside

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.969 
darker inside and lighter on the outside
at<00:03:38.940> first<00:03:39.419> I<00:03:39.569> wanted<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.989> opposite<00:03:40.440> like

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
at first I wanted the opposite like

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.009 
at first I wanted the opposite like
flight<00:03:41.310> white<00:03:41.579> inside<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:42.299> starts<00:03:42.930> on

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
flight white inside and then starts on

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.449 
flight white inside and then starts on
the<00:03:43.049> outside<00:03:43.379> of<00:03:43.560> any<00:03:43.650> economic<00:03:44.040> service<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the outside of any economic service and

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.699 
the outside of any economic service and
I<00:03:44.489> kind<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.699> like<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:44.849> nice<00:03:45.629> little<00:03:45.900> dark<00:03:46.199> so<00:03:46.560> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I kind of like it nice little dark so it
