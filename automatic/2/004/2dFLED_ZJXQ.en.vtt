and Isco gets the goal to make it 2-2

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.370 
and Isco gets the goal to make it 2-2
and<00:04:58.639> he<00:04:59.060> would<00:04:59.180> run<00:04:59.330> down<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.720> wing<00:04:59.840> cross<00:05:00.139> it

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
and he would run down the wing cross it

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.100 
and he would run down the wing cross it
in<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.740> then<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:02.090> happens<00:05:02.539> he<00:05:02.720> gets<00:05:02.960> a

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
in and then this happens he gets a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.740 
in and then this happens he gets a
penalty<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:04.220> I<00:05:04.340> couldn't<00:05:05.240> believe<00:05:05.419> this<00:05:05.690> was

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
penalty and I couldn't believe this was

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.480 
penalty and I couldn't believe this was
a<00:05:05.900> penalty<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.530> my<00:05:06.650> guess<00:05:06.919> my<00:05:07.009> reaction<00:05:07.370> was

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
a penalty and my guess my reaction was

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.700 
a penalty and my guess my reaction was
quite<00:05:07.729> similar<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.090> daven<00:05:08.449> Louisa<00:05:08.750> SIA<00:05:08.930> just<00:05:09.560> I

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
quite similar to daven Louisa SIA just I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.430 
quite similar to daven Louisa SIA just I

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
you serious how is this a penalty and

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.890 
you serious how is this a penalty and
when<00:05:12.979> you<00:05:13.070> look<00:05:13.250> in<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.490> replay<00:05:13.910> w<00:05:14.449> is<00:05:14.539> trips

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
when you look in the replay w is trips

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.560 
when you look in the replay w is trips
over<00:05:15.199> my<00:05:15.320> defender<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:15.949> falls<00:05:16.280> into<00:05:16.610> enter

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
over my defender and falls into enter

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.510 
over my defender and falls into enter
his<00:05:17.660> attacker<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.349> he<00:05:18.800> is<00:05:18.889> so<00:05:19.039> then<00:05:19.190> awarded

thinking in this game giving penalties
left<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.270> right<00:05:38.419> but<00:05:38.720> we<00:05:39.260> will<00:05:39.470> of<00:05:39.650> course<00:05:39.680> and

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
left and right but we will of course and

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.640 
left and right but we will of course and
take<00:05:40.400> it<00:05:40.580> it<00:05:40.750> getting<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.810> water<00:05:42.020> that<00:05:42.260> penalty

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650
