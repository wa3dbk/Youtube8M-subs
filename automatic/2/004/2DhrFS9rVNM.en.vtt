00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
coming out so my camera work is not that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.869 
coming out so my camera work is not that
good<00:00:31.580> but<00:00:32.580> there's<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.200> filter<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.379> there

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.130 

it's<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:38.969> focusing<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:39.480> well<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.020> got

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it's not focusing very well but it's got

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's not focusing very well but it's got
a<00:00:40.190> sponge<00:00:41.190> filter<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:42.020> carbon<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.289> some<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
a sponge filter with carbon and some I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
a sponge filter with carbon and some I
believe<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:46.129> file<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:48.000> bio<00:00:48.270> rocks<00:00:48.570> or

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
believe it's the file like bio rocks or

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.770 
believe it's the file like bio rocks or
something<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.780> ceramic

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
something like that it's like a ceramic

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
something like that it's like a ceramic
media<00:00:52.430> for<00:00:53.430> bacteria<00:00:54.770> lights<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:55.949> cool<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
media for bacteria lights pretty cool I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.549 
media for bacteria lights pretty cool I
like<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> design<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.660> light<00:00:57.840> turn<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
like the design of the light turn the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.610 
like the design of the light turn the
switch<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.920> real<00:00:59.100> quick<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:01.019> only<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> don't
