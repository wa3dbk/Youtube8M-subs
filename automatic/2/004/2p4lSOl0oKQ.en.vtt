00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.900

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.570

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.090

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.900
 their tits and ass 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.290
 if you are missing the smoking steps until 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.450
 your neighbors come home sitting 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.440
 on the stairs rolling until you come back 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.850
 to home 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.250
 I worry when you are 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:57.160
 late content when you arrive early 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.510
 I'll give you a bouquet of flowers and we'll go 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.229
 for a party and we're going to release 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.649
 apologize for being wrong and happy 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.720
 When you forgive me, look at your 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.250
 photos and wish the bad ones 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.250
 known since forever 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.630
 hear your voice in my ears feel your 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 skin 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:33.720
 and skin get scared when you 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.670
 infuriate I say you're wonderful 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.730
 and embrace him when he is anxious and 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.820
 welcome it when bruised want 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.410
 you feel it to offend 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:51.270
 when played regret when the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.560
 your side and moan for not being 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.560
 drown me 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 feel cold as you pull the blanket 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.260
 from vedder and when you smile and 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.420
 dissolve pampering with laughter 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.880
 but do not understand why you think 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:17.930
 that I'm rejecting when I'm not 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:22.519
 refusing to ask me how you can 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.239
 to think that someday I would believe 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.239
 to ask 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.010
 who are you 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.030
 and accept it anyway 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.110
 and tell you of the enchanted forest of 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.069
 boy who ran through the oceans 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.069
 because he loved you 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.780
 not having you in bed when I know 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.260
 You have to go miss her like this. 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.860
 that you know 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 and buy gifts you do not want 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.050
 does not matter if you change them and ask 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.270
 you at home even if you say 'no' 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.070
 again, keep asking because 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:37.290
 although you think I 'm not 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:40.310
 Seriously, I've always been since 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.310
 first time i asked 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.540
 I paid the city and feel that is 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.840
 empty without you 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.500
 but I want what you want and think that 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.770
 We're losing but I know I'm 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.780
 with you then he tells you 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.540
 worse things about me and tried 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.540
 give you the best of me because 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.199
 You deserve nothing less than this. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.350
 answer your questions when you would prefer 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.830
 do not you tell me it 's true 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.420
 in fact I do not want to and try to be honest 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.750
 because I know this is what you 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.210
 He prefers to think that everything is over but 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.490
 I'll wait for at least ten minutes. 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.170
 before you throw me out of your 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.170
 Life, forget who I am. 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.000
 Let me try to get close to you. 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:30.660
 then somehow some form of 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:35.330
 somehow communicate something to you 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:40.220
 another powerful and immortal devastating 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:48.020
 unconditional enriching environment 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:48.020
 always continuous brain never 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.899
 I have 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.760
 for you
