00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.159
 good in this section we will learn 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.360
 to enter a background image for 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.450
 make a render we have here our 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.429
 cube I'm not going to change it 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.059
 first of all we're going to go here to 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 properties 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.189
 we mark the option of skype noble in 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.189
 spain skype forgiveness for papers 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.270
 and then once we have 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.270
 done we need a texture 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.480
 of paper more or less we go reality 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.480
 let's go to new 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.500
 cloud we choose a fact movie 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.480
 here in make up open 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.100
 and energy most a texture so that 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.490
 we had downloaded a photo that we have 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.450
 gone down 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.450
 and that we have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 While still if they gave render with 0 c 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 I'm seeing nothing 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.690
 background still because I have to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.280
 go here I'm still here in 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.280
 texture tab 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.439
 and we have to go to the mapping option 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.450
 and in mapping mark this tab that 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.390
 the horizon makes the mark 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.580
 now if we render with effect 12 and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.180
 there we have our image 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.180
 we select 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.670
 the best and there we have our cube with 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 our background 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 alright let's go now then to remove 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 the cube of 2 we are going to learn to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.840
 introduce for example another element of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.490
 another file an object of the file that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.390
 we have done the following is done 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.390
 way for example 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.530
 well I'm going 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.530
 I give just the link 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.590
 here in just to add objects and 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.410
 work with them from other files of 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.879
 blender let's say do here I would go to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.120
 file so for example that I have here 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.980
 what would shark be 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.430
 I'm going to go to object what I want now 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.430
 It's the shark 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.870
 the objects I have a camera a cube and 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.870
 a lamp I know the cube 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.870
 Y 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.660
 selected I give penn 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.270
 and we have to add a modifier 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.580
 because I see that it is flat 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.900
 with right that is 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 I'm going to modifiers 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.569
 once I have it I'm going to place 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.620
 so to press control to zero 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.530
 by indicating that on the top 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.730
 you're wrong 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.140
 yes efe 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.140
 in the mouse and get me 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 perfect image the start button already 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.290
 I have 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.290
 I forgot to get screencast 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.420
 and now I 'm going to give a render with that 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.100
 12 and there I have my shark that still does not 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.210
 is so interested neither with material and 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.210
 textures but we have it there 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.150
 in the background we can also vary 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.880
 for example if we want 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.960
 to incorporate 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.150
 a background color 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.830
 for example we want to mix the image 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.740
 with a background color so good 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.970
 we would now be back to word 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.460
 we would mark 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.880
 the blend skype tab you see that now 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.320
 they are black has been added 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.630
 why now I will explain it for 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.250
 what 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.250
 change the color with a greenish color 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.690
 how would it look 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.520
 and I give a render s12 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.910
 mix but sacred klaus mix apart 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.709
 that already comes by default and textures 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.780
 here in particular in influence that is 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.780
 marked the option to instruct marked 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.690
 would see 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.449
 it stays with that but already 12 and 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.889
 remember that to make a mixture of 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.590
 color we just have to go to word 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.220
 and use Skype to mark it and choose the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.140
 color we want 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.430
 Now we can vary a little bit if we 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.660
 let's go back to textures we're 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.660
 if I want to go down a bit 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.400
 valencia- of the horizon and efe 12 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.820
 you see that I'm getting more color 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.820
 green 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.770
 they are giving me much more 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.350
 play with that variation 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.510
 today at maximum 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.100
 we can also play with the zenith of the 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.220
 top of the zenith of the part of 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.220
 down 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.880
 if we notice something, you see 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.750
 both on the top and the part 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.600
 lower 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.689
 playing with them to look for a kind of 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.889
 background that you will like 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.889
 that we have here 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.569
 well thats all thank you very much 

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:44.569
 we see
