00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
shoot off all everything in the quad

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
shoot off all everything in the quad
rocket<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.150> -<00:01:21.390> back<00:01:21.659> under<00:01:21.960> cover<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
rocket and then - back under cover and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.730 
rocket and then - back under cover and
under<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> cover<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> darkness<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.840> that's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
under the cover of darkness so that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
under the cover of darkness so that's
why<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> quad<00:01:26.520> rockets<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.060> good

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
why the quad rockets are really good

why the quad rockets are really good
with<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> Strider<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:28.049> able<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.650> all<00:01:28.920> of

extended<00:01:35.189> magazine<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.729> use<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.450> because

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
extended magazine I do use just because

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
extended magazine I do use just because
it<00:01:36.750> makes<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.340> more<00:01:38.340> sustained<00:01:38.759> fire<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it makes it more sustained fire and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
it makes it more sustained fire and
stuff<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
stuff but it just is really good with a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.030 
stuff but it just is really good with a
Titan<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> Strider<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.350> allows

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
Titan because with the Strider it allows

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
Titan because with the Strider it allows
a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.490> mobility<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> shooting<00:01:45.659> from

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
blast radius is freaking massive so

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.280 
blast radius is freaking massive so
that's<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.030> huge<00:02:48.150> advantage<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.720> gun<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.110> also

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.430 
windows and inside of doorways and stuff
and<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.640> get<00:02:53.910> people<00:02:54.260> hiding<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and you just get people hiding in the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.260 
and you just get people hiding in the
corner<00:02:55.770> hoping<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.220> don't<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.610> them<00:02:56.790> because

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
this again the blast radius is pretty

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.090 
this again the blast radius is pretty
substantial<00:02:59.490> with<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> quad<00:03:00.330> rocket<00:03:01.100> now

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
the enemy Titans you've probably doomed

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.710 
the enemy Titans you've probably doomed
to<00:05:15.889> titans<00:05:16.280> by<00:05:16.400> now<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.820> one<00:05:17.000> is<00:05:17.150> on<00:05:17.450> its<00:05:17.660> last

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
to titans by now and one is on its last

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.990 
to titans by now and one is on its last
legs<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:18.860> were<00:05:18.950> halfway<00:05:19.280> across<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.850> map

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
legs and you were halfway across the map

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.610 
legs and you were halfway across the map
already<00:05:20.210> that's<00:05:20.810> why<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.020> rocket<00:05:21.350> stuff<00:05:21.500> was

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
already that's why the rocket stuff was

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.340 
already that's why the rocket stuff was
so<00:05:21.740> good<00:05:21.919> if<00:05:22.010> you<00:05:22.130> use<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.639> forget<00:05:23.330> what<00:05:24.229> it's

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
so good if you use I forget what it's

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.439 
so good if you use I forget what it's
called<00:05:24.410> but<00:05:25.160> there's<00:05:25.340> that<00:05:25.490> three<00:05:25.940> pronged

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
called but there's that three pronged

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.230 
called but there's that three pronged
one<00:05:27.350> where<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.889> it<00:05:28.039> locks<00:05:28.310> on<00:05:28.580> and<00:05:28.760> does<00:05:28.910> three

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
one where you it locks on and does three

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.180 
one where you it locks on and does three
rockets<00:05:29.600> at<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:29.750> time<00:05:29.960> that<00:05:30.470> does<00:05:30.710> way<00:05:30.979> more

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
rockets at a time that does way more

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.219 
rockets at a time that does way more
damage<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.760> is<00:05:31.910> way<00:05:32.180> more<00:05:32.419> effective<00:05:32.539> on

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
damage and is way more effective on

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.440 
damage and is way more effective on
other<00:05:33.770> Titans<00:05:34.220> of<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.490> do<00:05:34.639> not<00:05:34.820> want<00:05:35.210> to<00:05:35.330> be

ordnance off the rocket salvo starts and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.920 
ordnance off the rocket salvo starts and
finishes<00:05:48.950> as<00:05:49.340> quickly<00:05:49.910> as<00:05:50.090> possible<00:05:50.479> and<00:05:50.630> does

a really decent amount of damage for how

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.930 
a really decent amount of damage for how
fast<00:05:53.510> it<00:05:53.780> goes<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.169> that's<00:05:54.349> why<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:54.590> use<00:05:54.830> it<00:05:54.940> now

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
fast it goes and that's why I use it now

before<00:06:57.400> you<00:06:57.430> nuclear<00:06:57.970> eject<00:06:58.300> it's<00:06:58.569> really

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
before you nuclear eject it's really

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.749 
before you nuclear eject it's really
actually<00:06:59.289> a<00:06:59.470> pretty<00:06:59.710> good<00:06:59.860> combination<00:07:00.129> the

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
only thing you got to worry about is

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.559 
only thing you got to worry about is
getting<00:07:03.099> melee<00:07:03.610> to<00:07:03.759> death<00:07:03.909> because<00:07:04.120> again

once<00:07:04.810> you<00:07:04.930> get<00:07:05.050> doomed<00:07:05.289> you<00:07:05.830> can<00:07:05.949> get<00:07:06.099> in<00:07:06.250> semi

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
once you get doomed you can get in semi

once you get doomed you can get in semi
lead<00:07:06.729> this<00:07:07.330> is<00:07:07.449> probably<00:07:07.750> the<00:07:07.900> best<00:07:08.199> class<00:07:08.680> and

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979
