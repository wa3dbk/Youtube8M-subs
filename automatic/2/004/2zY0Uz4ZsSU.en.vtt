these lights is the easiest it's simply

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.630 
these lights is the easiest it's simply
a<00:00:35.320> standard<00:00:35.530> bulb<00:00:35.920> like<00:00:36.100> you're<00:00:36.250> used<00:00:36.460> to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
a standard bulb like you're used to

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
a standard bulb like you're used to
simply<00:00:37.600> unscrew<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.140> old<00:00:38.170> bulb<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.600> replace

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
simply unscrew the old bulb and replace

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.810

it<00:00:41.079> with<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.199> new<00:00:41.379> one<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:42.250> it's<00:00:42.399> as<00:00:42.519> simple<00:00:42.550> as

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
it with a new one and it's as simple as

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.590 
it with a new one and it's as simple as
that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.750 

the<00:00:47.200> next<00:00:47.410> type<00:00:47.530> of<00:00:47.650> light<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:47.950> our<00:00:48.070> GU<00:00:48.430> tens

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
the next type of light is our GU tens

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.730 
the next type of light is our GU tens
and<00:00:49.060> again<00:00:49.300> they<00:00:49.450> can<00:00:49.480> be<00:00:49.630> halogen<00:00:50.170> or<00:00:50.320> they

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
and again they can be halogen or they

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.890 
and again they can be halogen or they
can<00:00:50.890> be<00:00:50.980> LED<00:00:51.400> you<00:00:52.240> notice<00:00:52.450> on<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.540> back<00:00:52.630> of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
can be LED you notice on the back of

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.240 
can be LED you notice on the back of
these<00:00:52.960> bulbs<00:00:53.320> there<00:00:53.530> are<00:00:53.620> two<00:00:53.770> pins<00:00:54.040> with<00:00:54.190> a

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
these bulbs there are two pins with a

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.220 
these bulbs there are two pins with a
slight<00:00:54.490> flange<00:00:54.910> on<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.240> back<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:55.660> and

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
slight flange on the back of it and

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.360 
slight flange on the back of it and
looking<00:00:56.470> at<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.650> sake<00:00:56.890> you'll<00:00:57.070> notice<00:00:57.310> that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
looking at the sake you'll notice that

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.070 
looking at the sake you'll notice that
there<00:00:57.550> are<00:00:57.640> two<00:00:57.820> grooves<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.720> those<00:00:58.900> pins

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
there are two grooves that those pins

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.680 
there are two grooves that those pins
will<00:00:59.200> fit<00:00:59.350> into<00:00:59.500> also<00:01:00.370> notice<00:01:00.850> how<00:01:01.120> one<00:01:01.450> side

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
will fit into also notice how one side

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.840 
will fit into also notice how one side
of<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.960> groove<00:01:02.200> is<00:01:02.650> slightly<00:01:03.400> larger<00:01:03.730> than

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
of the groove is slightly larger than

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.880 
of the groove is slightly larger than
the<00:01:03.970> other<00:01:04.089> side<00:01:04.560> first<00:01:05.560> make<00:01:05.740> sure<00:01:05.770> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
the other side first make sure the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.190 
the other side first make sure the
powers<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.370> lights<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.700> off<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.660> then<00:01:07.810> you

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
powers the lights is off and then you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.530 
powers the lights is off and then you
insert<00:01:08.560> these<00:01:08.770> two<00:01:09.040> pins<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:10.000> they<00:01:10.180> fit<00:01:10.360> into

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
insert these two pins so they fit into

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.140 
insert these two pins so they fit into
the<00:01:10.720> larger<00:01:10.930> part<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.440> grooves<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.850> then

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
the larger part of the grooves and then

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.400 
the larger part of the grooves and then
you<00:01:16.240> turn<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.630> about<00:01:16.750> an<00:01:16.930> eighth<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.260> turn

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
you turn it about an eighth of a turn

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.280 
you turn it about an eighth of a turn
clockwise<00:01:17.770> until<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.820> clicks<00:01:19.000> into<00:01:19.150> place<00:01:19.330> so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
clockwise until it clicks into place so

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.870 
clockwise until it clicks into place so
remove<00:01:20.530> this<00:01:20.650> bulb<00:01:20.890> simply<00:01:21.280> apply<00:01:21.580> pressure

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
remove this bulb simply apply pressure

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.990 
remove this bulb simply apply pressure
to<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.300> front<00:01:22.830> spin<00:01:23.830> slightly<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.880> then

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
to the front spin slightly and then

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.740 
to the front spin slightly and then
it'll<00:01:25.210> come<00:01:25.360> right<00:01:25.390> out<00:01:25.720> like<00:01:25.869> that
