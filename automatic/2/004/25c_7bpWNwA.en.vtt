00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
little bit skeptical of a coming out

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
little bit skeptical of a coming out
right<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:55.980> uses<00:00:56.579> string

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
right was that it actually uses string

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
right was that it actually uses string
in<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.800> or<00:00:58.969> rubber<00:00:59.969> band<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in it or rubber band if you want you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.539 
in it or rubber band if you want you
prefer<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:06.740> tried<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> keep<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
prefer I actually tried to keep it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.990 
prefer I actually tried to keep it
simple<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:10.080> regular<00:01:11.990> string<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
simple so I just use regular string and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.969 
simple so I just use regular string and
a<00:01:15.000> needle<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> got<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.979> was

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
a needle and this is what I got I was

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.940 
a needle and this is what I got I was
surprised<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.880> came<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.450> nice

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
one was that it's movable just take that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.990 
one was that it's movable just take that
out

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000

now<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.830> as<00:02:40.069> if<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.610> was<00:02:40.849> nice<00:02:41.180> enough

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569

right<00:02:42.170> what<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.310> liked<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:44.510> most<00:02:44.720> was

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
right what I really liked the most was

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.330 
right what I really liked the most was
that<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.530> actually<00:02:45.880> transforms<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:48.160> give<00:02:49.160> me<00:02:49.280> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that it actually transforms so give me a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:03:04.780 
that it actually transforms so give me a
second<00:02:49.730> step<00:02:50.090> transform<00:02:50.780> it<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:03.459> just<00:03:04.459> go<00:03:04.670> in

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
second step transform it and just go in

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:41.380 
second step transform it and just go in

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160
