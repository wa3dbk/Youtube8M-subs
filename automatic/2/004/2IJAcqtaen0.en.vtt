00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.070
 here you have to learn the cartilages 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.880
 easy 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.880
 petting 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.070
 Here we have the typical ibex that is the one 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.030
 it wraps everything 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.550
 the only totally closed 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.550
 the thyroid that has the shape of 1 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:31.400
 the aris of oinez that is this from here 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.910
 which is divided in its portion 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.160
 muscular and articulated 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.160
 and the epiglottis cartilage 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 the thyroid cartilage has the body 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.000
 while the braves 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.050
 and the side sheets because they will not be 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.079
 no way 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.940
 and the important thing about the equine is that it has 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.940
 here one in zizur to thyroid 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.750
 is where it is normally cut to make 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.260
 different surgical procedures if there 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260
 problems 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 the magnificent epic lotina 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.110
 important in the kino that has the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.940
 too developed lingual process 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.430
 after that if the horse went with the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.920
 tongue can fracture this bone 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.620
 and that inside there are some 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.100
 there you will see some red lines 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 and do it 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.170
 what are the vocal cords 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.170
 and on the sides 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.899
 this is where anything will happen 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.079
 here in the cartilage click today we have them 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.079
 which is the average ridge 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.720
 the doggy 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.420
 the puppy also has his cartilage 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.810
 clico and thyroid cartilage 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.250
 adif and mobile cartilage and cartilage 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.230
 article ti 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.420
 here there is a big difference with the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.420
 reiki not that your lingual process is not 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.799
 and that the equine of the only one that has 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.799
 insisted 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
 finish
