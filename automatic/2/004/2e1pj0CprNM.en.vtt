00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
which is sort of weird considering that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.780 
which is sort of weird considering that
they<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:08.580> always<00:02:08.849> put<00:02:09.300> kid<00:02:10.289> kid<00:02:10.950> Gohan<00:02:11.340> teen

from the boo saga so hopefully hopefully

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.990 
from the boo saga so hopefully hopefully
they'll<00:02:22.330> put<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.080> extra<00:02:23.980> maybe<00:02:24.730> they'll<00:02:24.910> put

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
they'll put the extra maybe they'll put

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.800 
they'll put the extra maybe they'll put

did a comic Omaha as as it's pronounced

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.240 
did a comic Omaha as as it's pronounced
in<00:02:32.620> go<00:02:33.010> tens<00:02:33.510> move<00:02:34.510> set<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.230> I've<00:02:35.560> nearly<00:02:35.950> got

in go tens move set so I've nearly got

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.480 
in go tens move set so I've nearly got
17<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.240> down<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.780> enough<00:02:38.050> where<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.560> hit<00:02:39.280> him

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
17 it down to enough where I can hit him

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.940 
17 it down to enough where I can hit him
with<00:02:39.670> super<00:02:40.060> Kamehameha<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.840> here<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.680> I'm

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
with super Kamehameha and here it is I'm

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.980 
with super Kamehameha and here it is I'm
able<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.790> charge<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.330> my<00:02:43.450> ultimate<00:02:43.870> I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
able to charge up for my ultimate I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.970 
able to charge up for my ultimate I
think<00:02:44.170> I'll<00:02:44.260> take<00:02:44.380> them<00:02:44.560> both<00:02:44.709> out<00:02:44.920> with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
think I'll take them both out with

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.280 
think I'll take them both out with
ultimate<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.640> don't<00:02:45.790> generally<00:02:46.180> take<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.170> I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
ultimate I don't generally take it I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.370 
ultimate I don't generally take it I
think<00:02:47.680> okay<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.910> think<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.050> do<00:02:50.200> it

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
think okay I think I think I can do it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.260 
think okay I think I think I can do it
even<00:02:50.980> though<00:02:51.370> my<00:02:51.580> key<00:02:52.360> gauge<00:02:52.630> wasn't<00:02:53.110> all

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
even though my key gauge wasn't all

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.240 
even though my key gauge wasn't all
electricity<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.750> sparkling<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.920> stuff<00:02:57.130> like

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
electricity and sparkling and stuff like

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
electricity and sparkling and stuff like
that<00:02:57.430> sometimes<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.239> think<00:02:58.300> if<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.600> get<00:02:58.750> hit

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that sometimes I think if you get hit

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.270 
that sometimes I think if you get hit
just<00:03:00.040> before<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:01.140> clicks<00:03:02.140> over<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.739> goes<00:03:03.070> into

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
just before it clicks over and goes into

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.250 
just before it clicks over and goes into
high<00:03:03.489> tension<00:03:03.940> you're<00:03:04.510> still<00:03:04.840> able<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.050> use<00:03:05.110> it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
high tension you're still able to use it

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.470 
high tension you're still able to use it
it's<00:03:05.380> happened<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.739> me<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> few<00:03:06.040> times<00:03:06.480> so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
it's happened to me a few times so

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's happened to me a few times so
charge<00:03:08.110> up<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.530> an<00:03:08.590> ultimate<00:03:08.920> but<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.280> am<00:03:09.370> NOT

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
charge up for an ultimate but I am NOT

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.220 
charge up for an ultimate but I am NOT
going<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.300> need<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.630> keep<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:10.989> key

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
going to you need to keep some key

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.800 
going to you need to keep some key

it's<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.590> pretty<00:03:26.769> decent<00:03:27.040> move<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> charge

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
it's a pretty decent move for a charge

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
proving to be a little bit more

proving to be a little bit more
difficult<00:03:51.459> than<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:52.110> 17<00:03:53.110> was<00:03:53.290> which<00:03:53.950> is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070

I don't know the coding for her
character<00:04:14.599> for<00:04:14.900> something<00:04:15.170> like<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.410> uh<00:04:15.440> no

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
character for something like that uh no

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.259 
character for something like that uh no
she<00:04:15.739> just<00:04:16.040> seems<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.489> little<00:04:16.910> bit<00:04:17.120> more

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
she just seems a little bit more

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.729 
she just seems a little bit more
difficult<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.660> wow<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.870> just<00:04:17.989> got<00:04:18.139> beamed<00:04:18.650> to

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
difficult and wow I just got beamed to

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.370 
difficult and wow I just got beamed to
the<00:04:18.829> face<00:04:19.190> now<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:19.970> think<00:04:20.150> I'm<00:04:20.750> almost<00:04:21.049> at<00:04:21.350> the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
the face now I think I'm almost at the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.180 
the face now I think I'm almost at the
stage<00:04:21.680> where<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.010> could<00:04:22.930> hit<00:04:23.930> her<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.410> super

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
stage where I could hit her with a super

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.700 
stage where I could hit her with a super
kamehameha<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> charge<00:04:27.169> up<00:04:27.290> for<00:04:27.500> that

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
kamehameha so I charge up for that

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.050 
kamehameha so I charge up for that
ultimate<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.880> there<00:04:29.660> we<00:04:29.780> go<00:04:30.020> probably<00:04:31.030> get<00:04:32.030> a

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
ultimate and there we go probably get a

ultimate and there we go probably get a
few<00:04:32.360> more<00:04:32.479> melee<00:04:32.810> hits<00:04:33.050> on<00:04:33.200> her<00:04:33.380> while<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.770> can

battle<00:04:53.740> personally<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.770> think<00:04:54.979> Goten<00:04:55.850> could<00:04:56.210> do

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
battle personally I think Goten could do

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.230 
battle personally I think Goten could do
it<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.620> don't<00:04:58.130> know<00:04:58.280> I<00:04:58.400> know<00:04:58.550> whether<00:04:58.760> if

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
it but I don't know I know whether if

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.120 
it but I don't know I know whether if
they<00:04:59.930> would<00:05:00.080> have<00:05:00.260> an<00:05:00.440> older<00:05:00.770> goat<00:05:00.919> and

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
they would have an older goat and

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.950 
they would have an older goat and
whether<00:05:01.310> his<00:05:01.880> attacks<00:05:02.360> made<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.630> little<00:05:02.810> bit

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
whether his attacks made a little bit

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
whether his attacks made a little bit
strong<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.229> bit<00:05:03.470> due<00:05:04.070> to<00:05:04.220> this<00:05:04.370> gameplay<00:05:04.700> I

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
strong a bit due to this gameplay I

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.000 
strong a bit due to this gameplay I
don't<00:05:05.690> believe<00:05:05.900> Goten<00:05:06.260> could<00:05:06.470> have<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> chance

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
I mean trunks was able to do it so why
