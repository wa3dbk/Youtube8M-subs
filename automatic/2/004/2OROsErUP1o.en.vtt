right now i also won't have to go
through<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.569> TV<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.230> get<00:02:48.379> my<00:02:48.530> sound<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:51.380> you

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
through the TV to get my sound there you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.819 
through the TV to get my sound there you
have<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.180> terabyte<00:02:53.630> drives<00:02:54.049> wave

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
have it to one terabyte drives wave

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.449 
have it to one terabyte drives wave
lossless<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.930> about<00:02:57.260> sixteen<00:02:58.010> hundred

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
lossless that is about sixteen hundred

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:07.089 
lossless that is about sixteen hundred
and<00:02:58.639> fifty<00:03:01.480> entries<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.840> drives<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.349> one

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
and fifty entries on the drives and one

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.150 
and fifty entries on the drives and one
entry<00:03:07.549> for<00:03:08.049> example<00:03:09.049> could<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.319> robin<00:03:09.889> trower

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
entry for example could be robin trower

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.699 
entry for example could be robin trower
so<00:03:10.760> under<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.660> entry<00:03:12.019> you<00:03:12.169> also<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.769> se18

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
so under that entry you also have se18

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.670 
so under that entry you also have se18
albums<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.849> there<00:03:17.150> are<00:03:17.180> much<00:03:18.049> much<00:03:18.319> more<00:03:18.620> than

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
albums so there are much much more than

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.659 
albums so there are much much more than
than<00:03:19.389> sixteen<00:03:20.389> hundred<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.840> some-odd<00:03:21.370> cds<00:03:22.370> on
