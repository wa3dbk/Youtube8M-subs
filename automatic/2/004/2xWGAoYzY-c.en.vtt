cream that kind of thing and then

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.480 
cream that kind of thing and then
there's<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.810> duo<00:02:03.960> crown

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
creamy ones for some reason I don't

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.840 
creamy ones for some reason I don't
really<00:02:10.380> know<00:02:10.560> why<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.860> purple<00:02:14.220> ones<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
really know why the purple ones like the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.060 
really know why the purple ones like the
duochrome<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.930> kind<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> blue<00:02:16.560> reflex

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
duochrome it's kind of the blue reflex

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.270 
duochrome it's kind of the blue reflex
and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.520> pots<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.390> pans<00:02:18.600> horseradish<00:02:19.280> lemon

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.620 
and then pots and pans horseradish lemon
and<00:02:20.670> cottage<00:02:21.030> cheese<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.860> shimmery<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
and cottage cheese are all shimmery and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
and cottage cheese are all shimmery and
we<00:02:24.630> shouldn't<00:02:24.810> take<00:02:24.930> these<00:02:25.080> off<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.470> don't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we shouldn't take these off so I don't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.080 
we shouldn't take these off so I don't
get<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.040> my<00:02:26.130> clothes<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.690> ok<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.850> first

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
get it on my clothes but ok the first

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.900 
get it on my clothes but ok the first
thing<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.330> notice<00:02:30.930> when<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.860> put<00:02:32.100> them<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.489> is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
thing I notice when I put them on is

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.910 
thing I notice when I put them on is
that<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> put<00:02:34.560> them<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.800> very

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
that you have to put them on very

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
that you have to put them on very
carefully<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.820> very<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.510> thin<00:02:36.810> layer

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
carefully and very in a thin layer

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.460 
carefully and very in a thin layer
because<00:02:37.739> for<00:02:38.280> me<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.610> tend<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.880> crease<00:02:39.470> when

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
because for me they tend to crease when

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800 
because for me they tend to crease when
I<00:02:40.500> put<00:02:40.739> them<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:40.980> because<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.150> oily<00:02:42.570> lids

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
I put them on because I have oily lids

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.460 
I put them on because I have oily lids
so<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:44.100> usually<00:02:44.250> creases<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.209> when<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> don't

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so it usually creases and when I don't

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.120 
so it usually creases and when I don't
use<00:02:46.680> them<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> doesn't<00:02:47.190> crease<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.640> off<00:02:47.760> so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
use them it doesn't crease it off so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.320 
use them it doesn't crease it off so
that's<00:02:50.130> kind<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.580> negative<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.239> have

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
that's kind of a negative so if you have

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.060 
that's kind of a negative so if you have
oily<00:02:51.480> lids<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.080> wouldn't<00:02:52.350> recommend<00:02:52.560> them<00:02:52.890> as

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
oily lids I wouldn't recommend them as

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.070 
oily lids I wouldn't recommend them as
much<00:02:53.370> as<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:53.940> me<00:02:54.299> with<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.630> regular

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
much as I would for me with like regular

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.610 
much as I would for me with like regular
lids<00:02:55.320> um<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:57.450> I'm<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:57.870> smooth<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.440> they

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
lids um like I'm really smooth and they

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.270 
lids um like I'm really smooth and they
do<00:02:58.680> enhance<00:02:59.370> color<00:02:59.700> for<00:03:00.660> example<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.040> i

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
do enhance color for example like if i

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.960 
do enhance color for example like if i
took<00:03:02.340> i<00:03:03.500> wish<00:03:04.500> i<00:03:04.620> had<00:03:04.709> black<00:03:04.920> blue<00:03:05.190> bat<00:03:05.670> blackb

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
um but that works too so the very

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.300 
um but that works too so the very
versatile<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:42.680> another<00:04:43.680> thing<00:04:43.860> i<00:04:43.950> could<00:04:44.010> use

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
versatile and another thing i could use

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.010 
versatile and another thing i could use
so<00:04:44.520> far<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.150> use<00:04:45.240> them<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.510> put<00:04:45.750> glitter

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.080 
so far you can use them to put glitter
on<00:04:46.170> things<00:04:46.710> like<00:04:46.920> if<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.130> do<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.280> stencil<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:47.880> it

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
on things like if you do a stencil of it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.570 
on things like if you do a stencil of it
and<00:04:48.240> like<00:04:48.360> have<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.570> on<00:04:48.930> your<00:04:49.800> face<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.370> could

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
and like have it on your face you could

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.490 
and like have it on your face you could
put<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.120> jumbo<00:04:51.450> pencil<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.990> then<00:04:52.080> pat<00:04:52.350> the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
glitter on it that would work really

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.760 
glitter on it that would work really
well<00:04:55.550> um<00:04:57.020> other<00:04:58.020> than<00:04:58.169> that<00:04:58.530> they're<00:04:58.740> very

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770

well um other than that they're very
creamy<00:04:59.490> they<00:05:00.060> work<00:05:00.419> really<00:05:00.630> well<00:05:00.890> um<00:05:01.890> in<00:05:02.100> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
creamy they work really well um in the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.409 
creamy they work really well um in the
summer<00:05:02.460> they<00:05:02.640> might<00:05:02.790> not<00:05:02.910> be<00:05:03.060> as<00:05:03.150> good<00:05:03.330> because

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
summer they might not be as good because

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.409 
summer they might not be as good because
they'll<00:05:03.660> melt<00:05:03.930> off<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.290> little<00:05:04.590> bit<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.419> like
