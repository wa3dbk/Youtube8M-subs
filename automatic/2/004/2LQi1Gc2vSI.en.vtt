00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:10.769
 February 17, 2015 Arrangement of ponytail that can be done easily this time 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.290
 Introduce 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.070
 First to SayakaHitoshié­¯ 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 From behind the ear 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.279
 I take a hair bundle like this, but one by one 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.700
 Turn clockwise 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.930
 Twist 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.290
 22 said 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.970
 right 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.590
 If you are awfully twisted 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.590
 Just about this middle 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.280
 by the way 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.320
 A little round 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.329
 turn 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.840
 I said 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 Using such ducklings 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 I will stop 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.130
 If it stops, it is 2 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.440
 p 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.440
 Under the place long pin 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.049
 Freshwater ray 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.120
 I will stop 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.810
 The other side is the same 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.340
 It will turn counterclockwise this time 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.329
 Left instead 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.329
 Nezu' to continue 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.620
 here 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.620
 Turn around 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.590
 here 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.869
 Stop 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.869
 Where did you feel free 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.979
 With skin 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.920
 Tonton 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.880
 netter you stuck it 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.880
 If you come here 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.170
 Active 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.640
 Fasten a rubber just at the good shape of the balance 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.210
 I also went to here 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.670
 With a hair band 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.450
 I was painting raised 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.050
 I will keep mixing the limper for a long time 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.050
 as you like 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.260
 In feeling 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.650
 Pulling places and so on 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.459
 Adjust a little 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.459
 Finish 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:51.030
 If you break it up like this 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.560
 It feels pretty easy but a little 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:01.590
 This is how you use Duckard 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.500
 Tara to you I'm glad because now as usually can be arranged A to that can not be distance phone 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.760
 Please try it for a moment 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.760
 This time was over
