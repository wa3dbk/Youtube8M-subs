00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
designed to actually fit your hand like

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720 
designed to actually fit your hand like
a<00:02:39.960> glove<00:02:40.050> like<00:02:40.260> Reggio<00:02:40.740> pit<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.070> over<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.550> let

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
a glove like Reggio pit was over we let

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160 
a glove like Reggio pit was over we let
him<00:02:41.850> try<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.120> some<00:02:42.270> gloves<00:02:42.510> he<00:02:42.750> didn't<00:02:42.990> like

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
him try on some gloves he didn't like

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.960 
him try on some gloves he didn't like
them<00:02:43.380> because<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.250> way<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:44.700> were<00:02:44.760> on

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
them because the way that they were on

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.730 
them because the way that they were on
his<00:02:45.090> hand<00:02:45.390> well<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.110> reason<00:02:46.380> being<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
his hand well the reason being is

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.920 
his hand well the reason being is
because<00:02:46.800> he's<00:02:47.250> got<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.940> bigger<00:02:48.240> bigger

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
because he's got kind of bigger bigger

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.690 
because he's got kind of bigger bigger
they're<00:02:49.380> smaller<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:49.890> thicker<00:02:50.220> hands<00:02:50.520> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
they're smaller but thicker hands I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.110 
they're smaller but thicker hands I
guess<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.060> sake<00:02:51.240> again<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.000> get

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
guess for sake again so you have to get

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.610 
guess for sake again so you have to get
these<00:02:54.240> gloves<00:02:54.420> designed<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.170> actually<00:02:55.320> fit

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
these gloves designed to actually fit

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.900 
these gloves designed to actually fit
your<00:02:55.770> hand<00:02:55.950> they<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.220> when<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.580> go<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> the
