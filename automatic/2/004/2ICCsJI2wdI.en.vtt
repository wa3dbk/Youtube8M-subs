on<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.410> way<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.680> pizza<00:01:06.860> parlor<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:08.210> just

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
on the way the pizza parlor and I just

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.630 
on the way the pizza parlor and I just
kept<00:01:08.780> waving<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.290> them<00:01:09.440> as<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.740> no<00:01:09.860> I'm<00:01:10.040> still

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
kept waving to them as it no I'm still

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.800 
kept waving to them as it no I'm still
right<00:01:10.790> here<00:01:11.800> so<00:01:12.800> it's<00:01:12.980> been<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:14.360> lot<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.630> fun

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
right here so it's been a lot of fun

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.910 
right here so it's been a lot of fun
spent<00:01:15.200> on<00:01:15.260> roads<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:15.890> little<00:01:16.340> bit<00:01:16.520> half<00:01:16.970> now

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
spent on roads but little bit half now

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.230 
spent on roads but little bit half now
so<00:01:18.920> how<00:01:19.160> about<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.430> conversion<00:01:19.760> how<00:01:20.060> long

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
so how about the conversion how long

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.460 
so how about the conversion how long
does<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.420> take<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.780> complete<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.260> conversion

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
does it take to complete the conversion

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.580 
does it take to complete the conversion
I<00:01:21.979> spent<00:01:22.490> about<00:01:22.750> 14<00:01:23.750> months<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.410> on<00:01:24.500> the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
I spent about 14 months to get it on the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.560 
I spent about 14 months to get it on the
road<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:25.100> worked<00:01:25.430> on<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:26.060> your<00:01:26.300> only

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
road so you worked on it on your only

James weeks off yeah on my own I'm a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.680 
James weeks off yeah on my own I'm a
mechanic<00:01:30.830> my<00:01:31.190> hobby

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
mechanic my hobby

I'm<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.810> machinist<00:01:33.320> by<00:01:33.470> trade<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:34.700> was<00:01:35.090> able

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
I'm a machinist by trade so I was able

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.290 
I'm a machinist by trade so I was able
to<00:01:35.330> do<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.590> lot<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.800> machine<00:01:37.400> at<00:01:37.759> adapting

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
to do a lot of the machine at adapting

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.440 
to do a lot of the machine at adapting
the<00:01:38.420> electric<00:01:38.840> motor<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:40.460> mounts<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.180> racks

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
the electric motor the mounts and racks

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.060 
the electric motor the mounts and racks
all<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.990> racks<00:01:42.320> are<00:01:42.560> made<00:01:42.920> out<00:01:43.040> of

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
all the racks are made out of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.800 
all the racks are made out of
lightweight<00:01:43.400> aluminum<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.300> made<00:01:44.509> all<00:01:44.660> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
lightweight aluminum so I made all the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.150 
lightweight aluminum so I made all the
racks<00:01:45.650> myself<00:01:50.380> they<00:01:51.380> claimed<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:51.830> me<00:01:51.950> being

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
racks myself they claimed to me being

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.460 
racks myself they claimed to me being
making<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.729> hybrid<00:01:53.179> Cayenne<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.560> we'll<00:01:55.310> see<00:01:55.580> I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
making a hybrid Cayenne so we'll see I

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.150 
making a hybrid Cayenne so we'll see I
guess<00:01:57.470> we'll<00:01:57.679> start<00:01:57.890> with<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:59.800> hybrid<00:02:00.800> from

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
guess we'll start with a hybrid from

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.770 
guess we'll start with a hybrid from
them<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.119> we'll<00:02:02.270> see<00:02:02.479> if<00:02:02.569> that<00:02:02.600> actually

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
them so but we'll see if that actually

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.320 
them so but we'll see if that actually
in<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:03.740> opinion<00:02:04.220> what's<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.880> future<00:02:05.090> of

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
in your opinion what's the future of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.469 
in your opinion what's the future of
electric<00:02:05.720> vehicle<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.860> need<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:08.090> need<00:02:08.300> to

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.609 
electric vehicle you need you need to
stop<00:02:08.750> making<00:02:09.020> excuses

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
stop making excuses

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.130 
stop making excuses
the<00:02:10.950> technology<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:12.810> need<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the technology is there you just need to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.080 
the technology is there you just need to
mass-produce<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.340> unfortunately<00:02:14.550> for

mass-produce it and unfortunately for

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.600 
mass-produce it and unfortunately for
you<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.870> basically<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.890> our<00:02:17.010> slaves<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you know basically we're our slaves and

it's<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.330> putting<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.750> genie<00:02:24.989> back

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
it's kind of like putting a genie back

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.699 
it's kind of like putting a genie back
in<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> bottle<00:02:25.530> you've<00:02:26.520> seen<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.000> many<00:02:27.709> people

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
in the bottle you've seen so many people

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.530 
in the bottle you've seen so many people
making<00:02:28.940> conversions<00:02:29.940> even<00:02:30.360> high-end

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
making conversions even high-end

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.410 
making conversions even high-end
conversions<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:32.190> know<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.519> Ian<00:02:32.880> Wright<00:02:33.120> was

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
conversions you know like Ian Wright was

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390 
conversions you know like Ian Wright was
here<00:02:33.660> today<00:02:33.900> who<00:02:34.140> did<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.410> right<00:02:34.590> speed<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.280> an

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
here today who did the right speed is an

are<00:05:51.879> they<00:05:52.210> some<00:05:52.629> of<00:05:52.689> the<00:05:52.779> biggest<00:05:54.029> innovators

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
are they some of the biggest innovators

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.570 
are they some of the biggest innovators
with<00:05:55.360> solar<00:05:55.839> technology<00:05:56.800> wind<00:05:57.099> and<00:05:57.249> thermal

because<00:05:57.909> the<00:05:58.089> government<00:05:58.569> makes<00:05:59.169> it

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
because the government makes it

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.309 
because the government makes it
cost-effective<00:05:59.830> for<00:06:00.699> you<00:06:00.939> to<00:06:01.089> do<00:06:01.240> it<00:06:01.419> so<00:06:02.110> it's

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
cost-effective for you to do it so it's

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.989 
cost-effective for you to do it so it's
just<00:06:02.409> you<00:06:03.099> know<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.370> biggest<00:06:03.550> thing<00:06:03.849> I've

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:03.999 
just you know the biggest thing I've

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.379 
just you know the biggest thing I've
challenging<00:06:04.419> right<00:06:04.599> now<00:06:04.659> is<00:06:04.959> finding<00:06:05.259> it
