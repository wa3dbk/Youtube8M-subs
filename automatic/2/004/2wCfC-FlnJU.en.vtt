a<00:03:24.810> couple<00:03:24.930> things<00:03:25.200> I'm<00:03:25.470> looking<00:03:25.590> forward<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
a couple things I'm looking forward to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.449 
a couple things I'm looking forward to
that<00:03:26.760> I've<00:03:27.030> been<00:03:27.180> thinking<00:03:27.570> about<00:03:28.459> looking

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
that I've been thinking about looking

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.270
