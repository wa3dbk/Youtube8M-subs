00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.440 
audience and learn and or take notes and
the<00:00:13.710> problem<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.219> applying<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.910> information

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the problem is applying that information

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.269 
the problem is applying that information
so<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> course<00:00:15.960> hands-on<00:00:16.800> gives<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.160> the

so of course hands-on gives you the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.010 
so of course hands-on gives you the
opportunity<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.789> bring<00:00:17.970> your<00:00:18.119> own<00:00:18.330> camera<00:00:18.869> in

your own lenses and actually use those

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.509 
your own lenses and actually use those
tools<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.650> find<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.010> when<00:00:23.189> people<00:00:23.430> are

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
tools and we find that when people are

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.920 
tools and we find that when people are
using<00:00:23.730> their<00:00:24.000> tools<00:00:24.180> they're<00:00:24.539> actually

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
using their tools they're actually

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
using their tools they're actually
asking<00:00:25.380> questions<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.490> things

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
asking questions that you know things

asking questions that you know things
that<00:00:26.939> may<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.570> an<00:00:27.660> audience<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.109> wouldn't

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that may be in an audience you wouldn't

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.320 
that may be in an audience you wouldn't
think<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.800> they're<00:00:29.490> touching<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> they're

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
think about they're touching and they're

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.060 
think about they're touching and they're
feeling<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.900> they're<00:00:31.080> seeing<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> light<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that's really important a lot of our

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.189 
that's really important a lot of our
students<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.120> read<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:54.840> study

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
students you know read and they study

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
students you know read and they study
and<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.500> try<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> soak<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.340> but

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and they try to soak it all in but

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
and they try to soak it all in but
sometimes<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.410> click<00:00:58.710> comes<00:00:59.100> right

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sometimes that little click comes right

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
sometimes that little click comes right
when<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.940> feel<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.750> actually<00:01:00.930> get

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
when they feel it when they actually get

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
when they feel it when they actually get
their<00:01:01.440> camera<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> their<00:01:02.550> eye

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
their camera they put it up to their eye

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
their camera they put it up to their eye
they<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> shot<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
they take the shot they look at it and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
they take the shot they look at it and
they<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> ah<00:01:05.909> that's<00:01:06.570> why<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.900> works

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
they see the ah that's why this works

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
they see the ah that's why this works
and<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.549> us<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.090> watching<00:01:09.360> little

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and so for us it's like watching little

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
and so for us it's like watching little
light<00:01:09.869> bulbs<00:01:10.200> go<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:11.010> soon<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.490> know

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
light bulbs go off as soon as we know

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.920 
light bulbs go off as soon as we know
they've<00:01:11.820> got<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.780> them

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
they've got it and then we see them

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
they've got it and then we see them
apply<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> sudden<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.760> see

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
apply it and then all of a sudden we see

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
apply it and then all of a sudden we see
them<00:01:15.060> take<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> different<00:01:15.810> level<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
them take it to a different level and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
them take it to a different level and
they<00:01:16.650> kind<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.100> their<00:01:17.310> own<00:01:17.509> now<00:01:18.509> if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they kind of make it their own now if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
they kind of make it their own now if
you're<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> natural<00:01:19.350> light<00:01:19.500> shooter<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.070> think

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you're a natural light shooter I think

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
you're a natural light shooter I think
you<00:01:20.580> should<00:01:20.759> absolutely<00:01:20.909> attend<00:01:21.689> this
