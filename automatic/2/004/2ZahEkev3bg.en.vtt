00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello and welcome loved point of failure 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.140
 com 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.800
 now let's go quickly 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.120
 look at a game played by two 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.430
 great masters in 1984 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.410
 we're talking about thin man that white 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.449
 and carpi with the black who announced that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.099
 it will be a really weird game and of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.800
 son and find great masters who 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.260
 they play games so open since 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.480
 immediately it was certainly the variant 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.969
 opening to favor a game like this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.329
 open but also very interesting for 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.270
 understand how the great masters solve 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.670
 these situations then the first move 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.770
 play was and 4 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 at this point after the four the five 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.260
 you enter a variant that seems 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.829
 that of the Spanish of four 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.750
 classic change at this point one yes 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:09.360
 wait I do n't know grasshoppers 6 bishop b5 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 but the white effect and the change instead 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.610
 play b5 bishop make a change a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 this point that horse can be 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 caught with two pedestrians or with that in be 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.130
 excuses I had with the one in or with 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 the one in b if the horse is taken 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.950
 with pawn in for sure all two 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.789
 in fieri year on 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.430
 free field of action and you are going to create me 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.030
 impels gilding if it can be taken with 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.560
 pedestrian in b the campochiaro standard bearer can be 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.539
 exit only from the diagonal c 8 to 6 that 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.179
 it is much lower than this one 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.340
 and clear nature is going to create anyway 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.369
 so at first it seems that the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.250
 catches struck better 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.920
 however the game proceeds with b for c6 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.439
 cost because this pedestrian is a commitment 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.649
 born will support a future push 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.039
 of the pawn of seven of five going to 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.509
 create a strong attack and then in black 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 plans to remove this burden 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.610
 donor as early as possible also to 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 cost for a moment to put you at a disadvantage 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:26.410
 to the campochiaro standard-bearer and 5 hours all 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.480
 according to the theory women 7 women and two 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.890
 among other things this variant is already 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:38.859
 beautiful because it looks like it continues 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.260
 horse of 5 c 4 just so bishop s 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.090
 at 6 obviously white cannot 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.569
 capture the other 20 horse for del 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.569
 Reggina 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.519
 so we take off from nailing 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.720
 woman and four horse b6 horse of 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.389
 two long castel c5 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.780
 here is this inactive to evaluate 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.880
 surely now the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.240
 releasing the thrust c4 c5 we have this 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.100
 weight a company but it is also an attack of 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.510
 discovery because the white has freed 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.500
 of the flower that can go to capture is 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.540
 the bishop in a6 then how to solve the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.450
 black situation by doing a rewards 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.820
 change of fairs but white is not at 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.300
 black game in fact plays horse 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:38.090
 pedestrian for horse withdrawn from fairs 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.250
 pawn at 7 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.560
 at this point one move is missing 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.200
 practically this pedestrian goes promotion 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.690
 and we are only at the thirteenth move 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.510
 we already have a pedestrian in vii crosses 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.810
 it is certainly an unusual location but 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.000
 the two players know what they are doing 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:01.580
 at this point we must avoid that the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.250
 pedestrian go promotion then rugby 7 e 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.100
 horse b3 here has been analyzed that 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.019
 it was better to play f3 mares given however 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.500
 that black perched long 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.019
 probably team thought that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.630
 put the horse in the woman's wing either 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:25.700
 the best thing instead of pushing it away in 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:27.800
 f3 f6 creating f4 voltage protecting 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.060
 exchange rate we are practically at 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.500
 first tower point and 8 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.960
 now we have this nailing precisely 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.470
 of the woman before the king and this 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.010
 double attack this battery of women 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:51.930
 tower by the black 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:55.610
 the only bishop defense f4 don h4 checkmate 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.340
 she was also a good four-man woman 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.350
 g3 to avoid the check and woman ca5 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 to go and conquer the white houses 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.550
 this was really a great one 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:13.070
 played by carp now towers c1 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.070
 let's go a little to attack the rhine 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.460
 but with king Oct this move has been 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.100
 followed by an exclamation point then 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.860
 a strong move with this move 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.050
 prophylactic will end removed all kinds of 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.940
 against white and it is not a move 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.940
 to be underestimated just because it looks like one 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.000
 passive move project is a bad one 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.650
 indeed move was really maybe the 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.990
 best play that black could do 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.940
 in this situation h4 so here we are 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.860
 you are not in a very open position 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.070
 it makes the house as clear as nature 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.750
 see you push pedestrians 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.840
 quietly 5 here is the famous one 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:01.940
 thrust we said at the beginning woman and 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.940
 three at this point g 5 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:14.800
 g5 bishop for g5 bishops b4a checkmate that 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.430
 now it moves to f2 attention with which 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.030
 we still have the nailing maybe 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:27.280
 black succeeded so there were fairs in 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:29.740
 b 6 then c5 obviously with the right ones 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.310
 precautions he would have if he would have another 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:39.520
 nailing then 3 f 2 tower in h va 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:45.250
 in f8 checkmated regi 2 we have practically 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:50.830
 the two kings in the opposite corners tower for 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:53.050
 and 5 and here perhaps the white did not have 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:58.210
 seen this combination or maybe not 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:04.360
 she had another woman and 5 woman choice 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:10.060
 f3 chess king h2 and women f2 to this 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:13.530
 point the white surrenders because the 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.970
 continuation would have been re h3 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.940
 bishop c8 checkmate 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:23.850
 the only one is that of advancing a pedestrian e 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.850
 f3 checkmate tower
