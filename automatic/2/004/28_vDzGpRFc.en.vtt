00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.020
 I find for a new tutorial on 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.270
 Minecraft 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.550
 how to crack easily and simply 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.189
 and quickly 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.349
 minecraft 1.6.2 so you go into the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.610
 link that I gave in the description 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.000
 you are going to have an archive so but 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 minecraft 1.6.2 crack baby star at 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.120
 louvre and and you must have a folder 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 minecraft 1.6.2 crashed ice tarot so 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 in this archive there is a beautiful but the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.150
 craps and lives at dell and minecraft 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 did so when you open the 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.710
 dead file like this and your 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.040
 browser should turn and that's with 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 the url of the video so if you have 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.510
 need that 's the point minecraft that's 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.650
 all the extra files that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.570
 will serve us to update 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.710
 Minecraft 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:12.010
 so we're going to copy that copy 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.420
 started at bogota so percent hop 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 data % 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
 account and here he means 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 replace so you do 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.930
 yes you tick the box apply my 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 choice for the next koffi 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 this is doing this for all yes alas 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520
 you're waiting 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.650
 I specify that it is that this crash in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.270
 does they walk for all 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.470
 versions greater than 1.6 but 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.369
 also all versions 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.540
 previous ones whose campaign and you will have 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.810
 all versions available in a 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.950
 cave of his very fast ago 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.920
 several tutorials on the internet that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.270
 circulate but they are complicated there 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.119
 must cut lots of files that's 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.530
 boring it works not often curable 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.810
 we have that version 1.6 points in 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.570
 general we do not have all the versions 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.490
 like how with my titina this is it 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.269
 finished 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.649
 so if we need weight mode 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.670
 Minecraft 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.170
 we can see that he added penalty 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.170
 particular files in at 16 hours 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.140
 so that's not all you need 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.680
 delete your old version of 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.090
 Minecraft 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.280
 so this is this here you open it 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.840
 and you click on the airbus desk is 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.469
 on the minecraft music desk 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.159
 gmail archive account here and you 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.159
 double click on it 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.390
 so here is the coming of charges and so 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.640
 we can see the display of news from the pub 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.319
 so had in version selection you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.109
 choose your version so from the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.549
 alpha version 1.1.0 to version 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.200
 1.6 not us who the latest version 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.400
 and if you want to update your 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.650
 minecraft is doing what it is after 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.569
 in force mtx you put your nickname 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 here and a memory you put the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.719
 memory that is allocated for the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.700
 program so leave it like this if you 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:23.099
 know too much then you know 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.760
 then click on the eye you wait 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.569
 a little while then it may be that if 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.129
 the first time you useful launcher it 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.489
 offers you life make you a little 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.060
 ax and there you can see that you have 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.709
 your minecraft 1.6.2 that loads and 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.659
 you arrive on minecraft 1.6.2 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.209
 could play as many singles enjoy 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:55.590

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:58.490
 go in small tailors and you 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.170

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:08.870
