00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.730
 nine times world champion with a 4 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.290

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.300
 I want I want to try to defend the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.180
 championship good we know there is a 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.370
 little more internalized with motorsport 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.470

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.270
 take it to the limit so that people 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.270
 know 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.590
