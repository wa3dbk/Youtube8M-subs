00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.830
 and 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.450
 mario part 8 receive their first content 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.630
 available in stores and in our 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 analysis we tell you in detail 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.950
 all its contents that offer new 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.950
 characters circuits and vehicles 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.790
 the three new characters are mario 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.320
 it's lucky that it's just mario 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.510
 disguised in the raccoon costume 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.059
 flying seen in super mario bros 3 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.769
 feline ticks the famous princess equipped 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.320
 with the cat costume seen in super 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.059
 mario 3d world we will link debuting 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.280
 in the saga mario kart arriving from the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.649
 saga the legend of zelda 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.210
 all these characters have different 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.550
 characteristics that make them unique 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 being mario tanooki feline pitch 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.960
 rather lighter than their namesakes 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 normal and with a high average weight 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.260
 if you bought the two packs of 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.360
 downloadable content we have also 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.370
 access to eight new yossi colors and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.930
 saica and among those who select although 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.230
 they do not vary in their style of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.230
 driving 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.590
 In addition to these corridors , 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.420
 incorporated four new vehicles the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.490
 kart to what a car with the theme 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.320
 of the famous raccoon costume and that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.630
 it has little acceleration but a good 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.790
 grab the iliana motorbike inspired by the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.770
 epona horse from lynn being this one very 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.210
 stable and manageable due to its great weight 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.460
 although with little acceleration 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.950
 the ray gt and very fast but with a 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.710
 more complicated handling has reached a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 vehicle taken from the saga f 0 quite 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.080
 compensated in each of its 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.080
 characteristics 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.300
 next to it we found the three cars 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.100
 of Mercedes Benz that came with a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.490
 free update of the game on 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.680
 mercedes benz modern heller 312 of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.930
 rochester of the 50s and the legendary 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.930
 silver arrow of the 30s 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580
 these finished vehicles incorporate 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.680
 new pieces to be two organized 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.780
 as wheels or for minds can 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.450
 modify the vehicles completely to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.159
 Our taste highlights especially the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.569
 that have the designs of the trifuerza 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.569
 of the legend of zelda 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.090
 there are two new cups that include four 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.830
 new circuits each one being these 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.830
 the cup egg and the cup trifuerza 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.909
 in the egg cup we find in first 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.860
 place the yossi circuit that already 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.569
 We could see in other installments of the saga 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.209
 and that has the shape of the iconic character 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.769
 with lots of known elements of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.840
 the games of mario like plants 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.019
 carnivorous and that has been remodeled for 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.330
 the occasion is the second circuit 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.310
 exhibits a tribute to the classic game of 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.349
 where we find ramps that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.360
 randomly generated and that have 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.549
 areas of grass and other puddles 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.530
 mud that we will have to avoid being this 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.680
 very fierce to the original title and one of 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.599
 the most striking novelties on the route 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.819
 dragon we have to get around very curves 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.709
 closed shortcuts and extensive tunnels 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.470
 representing the interior of a dragon 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.450
 that twists on itself by 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.420
 last we found an inspired circuit 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.489
 in the futuristic city ​​of 1,007 f0 with 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.680
 lots of neons covering the circuit 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.420
 Accelerators to gain speed and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.459
 side bands that you have to try 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.459
 dodge as they can electrocute the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.130
 the kite and force begins with the mine 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.960
 guard loaded with rails and where 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.440
 we found some creatures like 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.940
 bats that slow us down the breakthrough 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.980
 after this comes to a classic of the saga 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.290
 mario kart the ones in rainbow with 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.060
 very colorful mosaics and curves of 90 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.130
 degrees in which there is no guard 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.040
 rail and it's very easy to fall for your 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.020
 edges in full competition the next 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.760
 circuit is the polar base a new 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.350
 Civility track full of routes 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.910
 alternatives with lots of 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.300
 possibilities and where we should 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.610
 learn what is the fastest way 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.630
 finally and one of the most striking 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.820
 we found the circuit of irouléguy 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.080
 Inspired by the saga 'the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.120
 legend of zelda in which we 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.130
 We will enter into his castle taking 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.140
 this a source on which is the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.210
 master sword and being able to pass over 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.890
 she by lifting a letter of xativa to 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.720
 Press the three crystals 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.050
 they find just before they reach the 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.050
 room 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.530
 graphically maintains its quality 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.420
 highlighting above all the fidelity of 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.010
 some circuits to your debuts in the 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.380
 saga no to the classics to which 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.980
 they belong with colorful designs and very 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.980
 striking 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.130
 the soundtrack incorporates new themes 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.260
 some new and others inspired by the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.480
 Classics or Nintendo franchises with 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.500
 a touch in the style of mario kart being 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.500
 all very good 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.740
 as a conclusion we can say that the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.200
 mario's first downloadable content 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.120
 Kart 8 more than meets the needs of 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.100
 great variety of circuits that make 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.200
 the life of the game is that of vehicles 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.550
 pretty flashy and three characters 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.550
 among which the book 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.070
 his graphic section is still so 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.020
 good as in the original game with 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.810
 circuits and characters with designs 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.760
 friendly and at the same time very colorful the 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.420
 new built-in themes are also 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.420
 very good 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.560
 but no 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.539
 for its price especially if you do it 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.340
 with the set of the two tlc os 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.080
 we recommend doing with this pack 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.120
 offering lots of hours of 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.110
 Extra fun game that already 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.110
 yes it was round
