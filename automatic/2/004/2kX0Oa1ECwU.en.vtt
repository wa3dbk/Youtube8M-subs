 [Music] 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.639
 France has lived a year 2013 in which 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.029
 The main economic indicators 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.340
 have been negative more than 63 thousand 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.160
 companies have closed and unemployment reaches 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.619
 historical quotas more than 5 million 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.360
 French do not have a job or they 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.509
 they find themselves in a job insecurity 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.450
 France has a near savings rate 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.010
 to 16 percent of the population if that 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.379
 money was circulating in france- 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.520
 there would be credit for companies and 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.280
 having credit for companies 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.929
 there would be a growth ball and for 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.449
 so much would be absorbed a part of unemployment 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.420
 France's debt is approaching 95 percent 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.179
 percent of GDP the public deficit is 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.850
 greater than 3% the loss of power 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.339
 has accelerated and the pressure 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.589
 fiscal is impoverishing a 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.530
 population that disapproves of the policy of 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.420
 government that seems to want to continue 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.100
 the same way one of the problems for 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.350
 the 2014 by afonso london that has 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.630
 promised that the fiscal pressure was going to 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 be the same as in 2013 that was not going to 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.940
 there are tax increases but he 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.640
 will need to increase taxes or 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.960
 go down 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 and public expenses and you 're going to have to 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.229
 choose and in one case as in another 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.670
 we are still not very sure of what 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.570
 will do and there is like an uncertainty 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.310
 fiscal the slogans marked by europe 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.110
 demanding rigor and austerity and that have 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.570
 been followed by the French government 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.900
 have led to the increase in prices in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.060
 gas electricity transportations 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.280
 food and even a loss of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 purchasing power that in the case of 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 farmers is approaching 19 percent 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.229
 since this crisis began the measures 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.060
 European countries have not taken 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.280
 analyzing the social welfare but 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 analyzing how we can reduce the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 costs have had a thought that no 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.860
 it's a creative thought and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.509
 constructive but a thought that has 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.550
 been fundamentally negative when 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.399
 makes the economic balance of the year 2013 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.100
 there are no reasons to congratulate 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.280
 general way the French live today 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.280
 worse than a year ago the year 2013 for me 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.240
 it has been very bad 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.000
 It is clear that unemployment has not 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.069
 eliminated that the small and medium 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.310
 companies are still closing the doors 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.140
 because they do not have credits that the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.140
 social situation is becoming more and more 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.459
 difficult that the consumption does not get to come out 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.040
 forward and that there is a pauperization 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.959
 increasingly massive population 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.660
 French do not want to live a year like 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.840
 the 2013 in which they have lost quality of 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.910
 life and trust in his government with 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.910
