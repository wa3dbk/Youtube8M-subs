00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
top then in between the row of four

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.729 
top then in between the row of four
pieces<00:00:39.220> you<00:00:39.549> had<00:00:39.670> inserts<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.260> you<00:00:41.320> just<00:00:41.500> slip

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
pieces you had inserts so you just slip

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.979 
pieces you had inserts so you just slip
on<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.949> piece<00:00:42.220> in<00:00:42.430> between<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.879> two<00:00:43.030> pieces<00:00:43.210> so

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
on a piece in between the two pieces so

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.780 
on a piece in between the two pieces so
it<00:00:44.199> doesn't<00:00:44.470> actually<00:00:44.559> slip<00:00:44.979> over<00:00:45.159> any<00:00:45.400> points

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
it doesn't actually slip over any points

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.880 
it doesn't actually slip over any points
it<00:00:45.970> just<00:00:46.030> goes<00:00:46.390> in<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.600> space<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:50.470> that's<00:00:50.680> just

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
it just goes in the space so that's just

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.880 
it just goes in the space so that's just
three<00:00:51.040> inserts<00:00:51.699> then<00:00:52.299> add<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.479> row<00:00:52.750> on<00:00:52.930> top<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
three inserts then add a row on top so

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.420 
three inserts then add a row on top so
that<00:00:59.920> was<00:01:00.250> six<00:01:00.519> pieces<00:01:01.830> then<00:01:02.830> add<00:01:03.010> two<00:01:03.250> pieces

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430
