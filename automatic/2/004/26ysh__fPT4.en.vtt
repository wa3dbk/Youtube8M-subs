00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 today I will teach you to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.680
 to make nettle manure then for that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 you need a container I use 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.020
 an old one does everything but you can 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.790
 take a badly used jump does it all 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.010
 just because he has a father that's 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.939
 much more practical 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.850
 so now we're going to look for 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.060
 exit I'm lucky to have some at the bottom 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060
 from my garden 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.340
 then you need a kilo of nettle for 10 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.930
 liters of water but we are not in the garden 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 to take the lead 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.300
 so I use I do not pass my 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.750
 outings I use what I have you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 take the nettles then with gloves 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.100
 to avoid getting stung and wanted 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.100
 cut into pieces in your container 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.600
 so I harvested and cut the assets 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.770
 now i'm going to add lost us our 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 during ten liters 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.960
 I will mix 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.410
 I mix in one direction then in 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 the other well energized the water for 2 to 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.890
 3 minutes 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.300
 do not hesitate to mix 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 several times in the day 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.350
 I put a cover during the night to 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.690
 in case of rain my pura is protected 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.270
 in the morning I remove the cover I mix 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.580
 again I do this operation between 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.760
 5 to 10 days depending on the weather 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.930
 until a beautiful white foam 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.980
 appear that's what we'll see 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.980
 in the next video
