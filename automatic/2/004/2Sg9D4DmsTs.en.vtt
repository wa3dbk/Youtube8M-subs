00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.380 
pretty hard but I'm gonna have my two
fighting<00:02:03.190> types<00:02:03.400> along<00:02:03.729> with<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.000> bulldozer

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
fighting types along with the bulldozer

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.230 
fighting types along with the bulldozer
and<00:02:04.840> another<00:02:05.260> Pokemon<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.430> will<00:02:06.729> more

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
and another Pokemon so I will more

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.570 
and another Pokemon so I will more
easily<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.930> able<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.170> take<00:02:08.500> out<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.979> geodude's

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
easily be able to take out the geodude's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.729 
easily be able to take out the geodude's
because<00:02:10.390> these<00:02:10.540> two<00:02:10.780> dudes<00:02:10.989> are<00:02:11.200> pretty

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
because these two dudes are pretty

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.710 
because these two dudes are pretty
strong<00:02:12.070> as<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.459> can<00:02:12.610> see<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:12.940> taking<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.450> lot

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
strong as you can see it's taking a lot

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.050 
strong as you can see it's taking a lot
of<00:02:13.780> seismic<00:02:14.320> tosses<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.980> kill<00:02:15.489> them<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
of seismic tosses to kill them in the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.949 
of seismic tosses to kill them in the
end<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.590> could<00:02:17.980> be<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.160> challenge<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.000> take

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
end so it could be a challenge to take

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.860 
end so it could be a challenge to take
out<00:02:20.170> those<00:02:20.410> Pokemon<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.540> one<00:02:22.540> thing<00:02:22.750> I'm

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
actually put my Victini just solar being

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.200 
actually put my Victini just solar being
very<00:03:17.560> good<00:03:17.830> idea<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.370> some<00:03:18.610> water<00:03:18.760> types

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
very good idea to have some water types

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.970 
very good idea to have some water types
a<00:03:19.420> lot<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.690> special<00:03:20.050> types<00:03:20.260> if<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.740> have

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
a lot of special types if you can have

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.070 
a lot of special types if you can have
them<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.720> damn<00:03:24.700> took<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.450> big<00:03:25.870> time

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
them and damn took it big time

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.770 
them and damn took it big time
and<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.340> i<00:03:27.640> guess<00:03:28.120> that's<00:03:28.390> it

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
and and so i guess that's it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.980 
and and so i guess that's it
i<00:03:28.810> don't<00:03:29.380> really<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:30.480> what<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.660> point<00:03:31.900> of

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
i don't really know what the point of

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.750 
i don't really know what the point of
these<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.350> think<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:32.650> more<00:03:32.950> how<00:03:33.160> about<00:03:33.370> like<00:03:33.580> a

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
these I think it's more how about like a

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.730 
these I think it's more how about like a
challenge<00:03:34.450> level<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:34.960> more<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.320> challenge

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
challenge level it's more of a challenge

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.410 
challenge level it's more of a challenge
you're<00:03:35.860> not<00:03:35.980> supposed<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.430> win<00:03:36.670> anything
