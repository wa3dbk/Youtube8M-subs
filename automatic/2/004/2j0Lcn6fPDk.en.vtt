00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.350
Alright, we got out here to sun set for evening
night water.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.630
To water my plants.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.480
Well actually I am not really watering my
plants in there.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.965
We’re just gonna wetting em down because
we’re gonna today is that we’re gonna

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:16.520
release some beneficial insects.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.249
So I love releasing and using beneficial insects
to basically eat the bad bugs because when

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.019
you got too much bad bugs, the bad bugs suck
the juice or the life outta your plants.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.210
So first what we have to do is to water this
down because what we’re gonna do today is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.100
release lady bugs.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.790
So by watering down the plants and once again
release your lady bugs at night, they have

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.470
the highest probability of actually hanging
out and not flying away.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.559
Once again lady bugs are well they are wild
animals or wild creatures.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.719
And even though you release it doesn’t mean
they are gonna stay in your garden.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.949
So a few things you could do like you know,
release em at night or when it turns light

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.149
or when the suns down, or actually probably
wait a little bit and release em in the little

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.480
bit, when it gets even darker.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.360
But then I couldn’t make the video.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.380
Number 2 you want to water your plants down.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.150
You know get it nice and moist for em, you
know that’s going to be really important.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.180
And the final thing and the most important
thing before you release any beneficial or

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.340
beneficial insects in your garden, is to make
sure they are going to have food.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.840
Haha, because if your like… oh lets release
some beneficials I don’t know if I need

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
em or not.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
If you release em and there’s no food for
them…

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.360
guess what they are gonna split.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.130
Cause your gonna go somewhere else where there
is food you know.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.070
I mean I’d love to hang out at my house
cause I have all this food to eat.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.640
But my neighbor has a lawn, so I am not gonna
hang out at his place.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.450
So lemme show you what I mean by some food.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.870
These are some actually flowering ummm brussels
sprout tops.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.430
And you know it makes the Brussel sprout flowers.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.560
Which are quite edible, and the top these
are the unopen buds.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.290
They look just like broccolis and you can
eat em just like broccoli but if you do a

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.430
close up here on this so here’s all this
grey thing I don’t know if you can see them,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.350
and here’s the flowers here’s the unopen
buds.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.119
And all of these little grey dots, and if
you look closely those little grey dots are

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.399
moving.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.640
And those little grey dots are the aphids,
and aphids are not good bugs.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.350
So the easiest way to solve this problem is
to basically just snap this whole top off…

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.660
I got it now, and now we’re gonna take and
dispose off this.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.312
So now we’re just gonna get this off the
property what I am gonna do is put this in

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:30.750
my green bin which basically goes into the
central composting facility to get these off

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.200
my property cause I don’t want these aphids
on my property.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.840
Cause what happens is these guys are sucking
juice like in the life out of your plants.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.260
Taking the life force out of your plants,
and multiplying.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.670
So if I come back tomorrow, you know they
have affected this much of the stem though….

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.680
they will be down here.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.450
And go down even further, and there are all
this different stem.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.350
Well you know you could pick em all off, and
once again I recommend manual control as your

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.050
first line of defense.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.360
You know, yes it takes some time, you gotta
use your eyes be perceptive.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.959
Helps keep your brain active that’s good
stuff.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.980
But uh pick em all off and get em outta here.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.150
Step number one.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.390
Then you probably won’t get em all cause
they are little, you know, they hide.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.850
That’s why we’re gonna release the lady
bugs.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.940
You know, definitely another good step.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.540
Another good step would be blast them off
with water.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.130
But today we’re gonna release lady bugs.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.040
So let me go inside and get em out of where
I’ve have been having them for safe keeping.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.310
So were here in my kitchen and here’s my
nice fridge.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.950
We’re gonna open this up and and check out
what’s inside.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.750
Well besides all my food, we got the lady
bugs hanging out inside.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.430
Now why am I storing my lady bugs inside the
fridge.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.520
So basically that stimulates winter time and
in winter they are dormant.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.240
And they are like in slow motion, slow animation.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.540
So they are just kinda hanging out waiting
for spring time.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.099
So that then they can become alive.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.000
One you do get your lady bugs.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.140
You know you don’t want to keep em in your
fridge too long.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.320
They do ship with some food but you know what,
if you keep em in there too long, they might

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.110
not make it.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.290
So uh let’s head outside and release the
lady bugs.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.840
Okay so now we’re outside, getting darker
out here . And we’re gonna take of the cover…

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840
woah watch out!!

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.060
Haha , just kidding.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.190
So you can just take it off, and see them
you know climbing around in there in the state

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.989
of like slow motion or spended animation cause
they are just not moving really that fast

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.699
cause its been too cold.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.863
And you know the good thing is that the lady
bugs don’t fly at night so that is one another

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.770
reason why you want to release these at night
and water the area.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.830
And there actually just trying to crawl out
of the container here.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.629
So I am just gonna simply take the container
and you know with the bedding and everything

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.990
I am just shaking em around the infected areas.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.379
And the others are gonna drop to the ground,
but you know what they like to climb at night.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:47.379
So they will actually just climb up on top
of the plants and find all the aphids and

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.300
they’ll say oh this is a good place to live.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.039
You know we’re gonna hang out here and lay
our eggs and then we will have more lady bugs

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.330
later.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.750
And so sure enough I did a nice big lady bug
release last year and I still have lady bugs..

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.249
you know that before I even released any this
year.

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.719
So lady bugs can eat up to 50 aphids a day.

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:07.880
That’s a lot of aphids.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.009
They can just probably clear cut the tops,
and just eat em all.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.669
And when the lady bugs actually hatch the
eggs, they are really a trip they look like

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.669
little alligators.

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.639
They are kind of red, so you see those don’t
be alarmed . And they also lay these little

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.169
egg sacs that are funny hanging things and
I do have a video of like a baby lady bug,

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.460
if you look back at my old videos.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.849
I was so amazed the first time I ever saw
one.

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.999
I mean I have already seen some of them in
my garden this year.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.659
They are super amazing.

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.020
But I love lady bugs, and once again lady
bugs are beneficial insects.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.340
You can release them in your garden, to control
some of your pests.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.789
Oh and don’t fall for it.

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.839
If you see the lady bugs, it says stay home
lady home lady bugs.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.069
Like they are supposed to stay in your home
stay in your property.

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.340
Don’t believe it, cause you know what they
are gonna go where there is food and once

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.550
again the main thing to remember.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.610
Number one water your area down release them
at night and make sure they have food in the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.300
area so that they could all hang out and feed
on your bed bugs.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.099
Alright , so let’s check out some lady bugs.

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.849
Get it on!!!

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.819
Haha…So I did a lady bug release as you
saw.

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.030
Here’s some lady bugs, I don’t know if
you can see that.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.789
Right there, like one is right on top of the
other.

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:26.979
They are mating.

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.759
Oh man look so there is one there, and there’s
also one underneath here I don’t know if

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.639
you can see that underneath that.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.770
And here wo go look, there’s even more.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.550
There’s a lady bug orgy going on right here…
right there.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.150
More right there… and even right there and
right there.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.500
I have released one whole container of lady
bugs and they are all mating right now, and

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.910
I think they know that this is a good place
to mate because just right above where they

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.490
are mating and then they are also soon be
laying some eggs… is their food source.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:08.650
Look at all these aphids in my flowering dinosaur
kale, so I love to release lady bugs, so that

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.460
they will mate and lay eggs and so then I
will have continual lady bugs you know in

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:25.090
my garden, to prevent aphids aand other insects
because, baby lady bugs are voracious aphid

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.090
eaters.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.699
So hopefully you’ve enjoyed learning about
lady bugs today.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:32.000
Once again this is John Kohler, with growingyourgreens.com.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.589
We’ll see ya next time and use some biological
controls to control pests in your garden.
