00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello how are we going to cut two today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.500
 shirts and we're going to finish them with two 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 good different hem we're going to 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.010
 make it simpler and lautaro we are going to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.150
 put a patient with the patient what 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.940
 we are going to get is that more 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.800
 stuck I have to say that it was not me 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 the one that I made it so with my video 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.189
 we learn both you and I hope 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.189
 that you like let's see it 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.109
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.720
 pick up a pin to know where 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.640
 we want counting on the shirt 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 folded in four parts let's take 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.780
 again pins so that we do not get 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.780
 move and we will cut straight shapes 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.010
 i 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.760
 we remove the pins and now I'm going to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 teach how to make the hem more 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.510
 simple for that let's take the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.160
 purple shirt we're going to fold it in two 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.160
 times and we are going to cook 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050
 Y 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 i 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 he brings the simplest and the one that usually 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.030
 take all the shirts now I'm going 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.500
 to teach how to do it with patent 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.160
 we take the fabric that was left over before 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.790
 the gray shirt and cut to eye a 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.790
 cachito 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.689
 we remove the pins 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.900
 we take a point walks eye 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.690
 and we cut it 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.670
 with this what we are going to that the patent 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.020
 be smaller than the shape t - shirt 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.770
 you stay more punch when 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.770
 let's put it open we turn it around 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.569
 and fold it by moving 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.510
 now with the shirt the other way around with the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.080
 sewing outward we put this 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.870
 patent on the inside part of mode 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.570
 that there are three fabrics finishing the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 T-shirt I do not know if you understand me but 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.190
 good with the image I think so 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.959
 we take another pin by the other seam 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.170
 we stretch the shirt 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.340
 we place it so that they are the same in 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.340
 tip 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.130
 and we again take with pins by the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.130
 center of the shirt 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.780
 and now we take the edge where they are 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.470
 the three wings and when we fold it 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.370
 A) Yes 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.690
 this is the part of inside 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.690
 and that's how it looks on the outside 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.330
 now what we are going to do things is 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.069
 a line above that already 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.780
 we had and this we are going to do for the 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.160
 part of the shirt with the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.819
 inward seams as you are 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.819
 seeing in the image 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.670
 and that's how it is now that they take 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.440
 so much the short t-shirts so let's go 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.180
 to take advantage of all we have and 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.370
 that we do not put so much and we're going to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 force it for sure we take advantage 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.430
 a little kiss we are not going to next Friday 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.430
 bye
