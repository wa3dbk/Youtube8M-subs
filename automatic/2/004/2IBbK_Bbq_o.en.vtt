hello my name is John nakia and today
I'm<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.180> talk<00:00:06.330> about<00:00:06.510> the<00:00:06.660> Eco<00:00:06.990> Matic

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260 
I'm going to talk about the Eco Matic

chlorinators sanitize pool water by

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.770 
chlorinators sanitize pool water by
taking<00:00:12.900> dissolved<00:00:13.379> salt<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.919> the<00:00:14.099> water<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
taking dissolved salt in the water and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.870 
taking dissolved salt in the water and
transforming<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.110> hypochlorous<00:00:16.710> acid

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
transforming it to hypochlorous acid

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.520 
transforming it to hypochlorous acid
which<00:00:17.880> prohibits<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> growth<00:00:18.870> of<00:00:18.900> algae<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
which prohibits the growth of algae and

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.920 
which prohibits the growth of algae and
makes<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.830> safe<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.160> swim<00:00:20.280> in<00:00:20.660> when<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> water

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
makes it safe to swim in when the water

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
makes it safe to swim in when the water
flows<00:00:22.200> through<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> cell<00:00:23.070> housing<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
flows through the cell housing and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.130 
flows through the cell housing and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.280 
through the cell the powerbox generates
an<00:00:28.380> electric<00:00:28.830> current<00:00:28.980> which<00:00:30.110> transforms<00:00:31.110> the

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
an electric current which transforms the

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.290 
an electric current which transforms the
chlorine<00:00:31.860> in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> water<00:00:32.129> to<00:00:32.759> hypochlorous

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
now there are many benefits about the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.080 
now there are many benefits about the
Eco<00:00:40.080> Matic<00:00:40.350> salt<00:00:40.530> chlorinator<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.760> help<00:00:41.970> it

Eco Matic salt chlorinator that help it
perform<00:00:42.240> efficiently<00:00:43.160> number<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> power

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
perform efficiently number one the power

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.390 
perform efficiently number one the power
box<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.930> back<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.230> power<00:00:46.470> box<00:00:46.650> the

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
box in the back of the power box the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.420 
box in the back of the power box the
entire<00:00:47.730> back<00:00:48.120> panel<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.900> heat<00:00:49.230> sink<00:00:49.500> because

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
entire back panel is a heat sink because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.280 
entire back panel is a heat sink because
the<00:00:50.550> electrolysis<00:00:50.940> process<00:00:51.300> generates<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.140> lot

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
the electrolysis process generates a lot

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.830 
the electrolysis process generates a lot
of<00:00:52.320> heat<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.700> heat<00:00:53.970> sink<00:00:54.300> dissipates

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
of heat and so this heat sink dissipates

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
of heat and so this heat sink dissipates
that<00:00:55.050> heat<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.410> allows<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.070> operate<00:00:56.190> more

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that heat and allows it to operate more

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.930 
that heat and allows it to operate more

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
chlorine output dial can be adjusted

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.279 
chlorine output dial can be adjusted
from<00:01:05.820> zero<00:01:06.180> percent<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:06.960> hundred<00:01:07.109> percent

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
from zero percent to one hundred percent

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.499 
from zero percent to one hundred percent

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
depending on how much chlorine you need

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.889 
depending on how much chlorine you need
to<00:01:09.689> maintain<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.259> cool<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:11.700> has<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.299> winter

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
to maintain your cool it has a winter

by activating the winter mode you will

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.539 
by activating the winter mode you will
