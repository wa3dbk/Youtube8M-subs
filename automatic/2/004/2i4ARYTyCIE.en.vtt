00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.710
 so solÃ¨ne we will start with the nr 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 the most classic who can who can 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.880
 to exist for that we will need 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 necessarily a liner what I advocate 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.269
 for this for that style it's 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 work with a liner that is pretty 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.330
 end so there me them in the form of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.669
 brush you see that can be too 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.680
 possibly a pencil here is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 always a liquid texture then that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.579
 a little bit scared the liner but not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 panic we will go in stages so 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.160
 in your house you will look down we are 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.680
 okay and we'll start with 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.110
 apply the liner along the bottom of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.629
 eyelashes from inside to outside 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.739
 do not quite finish 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.510
 the idea here is not to focus on 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 a straight and straight line have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.399
 will retouch after I do little to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 kourou agree okay so second 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:11.040
 step we will do so the tip of the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.230
 liner towards the outer corner and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 the idea now is to connect the two 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.450
 with the entrance a little bit posed 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.510
 the fim his trait is now we come 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 fill all the small areas of 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.530
 white that can be flush with eyelashes 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.530
 without romaine of materials this is not necessary 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.740
 there is too much we make a pretty 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.260
 tip is the same I do it again until 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.770
 inside you look we will wait 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.470
 a few seconds that it dries the little 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.180
 trick to correct the liner if ever 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.200
 you are not mistaken for panic 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.670
 always have at hand 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.260
 small cleansing wipes or 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.630
 possibly a little cotton soaked in 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.330
 of a notion like that it is precise 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.420
 I was with the finger there you come 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.490
 erasing the erasure you look at you face 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.810
 in the mirror a dish he will come 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.810
 extend a little bit more 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 tip closed eyes not to hesitate to there 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.570
 go by stages 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.870
 here is a more homogeneous rendering 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.910
 where the eyes and we are good for the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.190
 first look really has it all basic 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.430
 the liner days that was ready to go 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.430
 make 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.820
 so now the solenoid idea is going 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.709
 to be transforming the liner that one 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.510
 had done just before you passed the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.610
 day with girlfriends call you 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.400
 go out in five minutes you will transform 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.350
 in loop we always use the same 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.380
 liner and in fact we will create an effect 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.620
 graphic on your look that is to say you 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.280
 go close your eyes so always with 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.780
 The point 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.630
 we're going from outside the towers 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.730
 niner and we will try to make a line 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.370
 towards the puy to make an effect 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.110
 graphic when you have eyes 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.630
 open will be a trend a little bit more 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.200
 dark to your look so very glamorous 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.910
 here to go out that goes very well and 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.010
 at the same time you will have a little twist 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.220
 it's very trendy right now on 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 podiums I'm just ironing on your 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.730
 very much to make it sharper 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.790
 and I extend them up to a third of the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:27.220
 look at the steps to come mark the whole 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.300
 grumble inside you open and here we have 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.780
 a sharper look more graphic 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.780
 ready to go out 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.270
 so this is now what we are going 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.040
 see at the level of the liner it is 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.510
 the simplest trick to apply 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.580
 his eyeliner is that we do not have time 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.190
 or be afraid of real felt 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.200
 eyeliner here we go to work with a 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.790
 black pencil preferably 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.980
 so we will come to apply everything 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.970
 just his pencil on the eyelash 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.950
 closed upper eyes there again 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.620
 let's just work on small to 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:09.520
 shot and follow the lash line 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.550
 like that you have a natural guide since 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.080
 have a medium or strong intensity 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.769
 depending on how much you want to give to your 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.480
 look done with this type of technique one 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.910
 will have the impression of drawn on the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.590
 look through the liner also give a 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.080
 effect a little bit this word that has 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.650
 pretty trendy to your look and we're going 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.400
 do the same thing 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.440
 orad if he's just on the outside and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 the same we follow the fringe of eyelashes 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.030
 natural accord and to finish cotton 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.240
 stem if we have a brush rather small 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.100
 will come smoke shut your eyes so smoke 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.700
 its door very well its name ie 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.430
 make the line blurry do you in 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.240
 leave your pan lightly and we make the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.890
 same thing below if we want more 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.960
 of intensity we can start again 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.760
 we take again his pencil which we put back a 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.950
 little bit it sells at the intensity that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.840
 you want and such a killer foot with your 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.490
 clamp the small nozzle or optionally 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.110
 a canton that shocks and so in fact one 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.700
 pay it a second time if needed 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.620
 not this time who manages it at the moment 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.450
 we have no more with the quite 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.650
 this is the first step of the fact of 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.740
 put two layers that can help too 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.760
 to hold your makeup 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.760
 that's simple and effective 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.720
