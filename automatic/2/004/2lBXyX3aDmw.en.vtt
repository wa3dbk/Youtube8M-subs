00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.760
 the first layer is a layer of slices of eggplant 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.010

 we lay it on top of his eggplant 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 layer and also need some salt 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.659
 we cut the garlic so thin 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.350
