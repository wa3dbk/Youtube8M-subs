irons is this bed frame steel and clamps
some<00:00:42.329> wheels<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.850> how

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
some wheels on it you don't know how

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.160 
some wheels on it you don't know how
this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> gonna<00:00:45.360> work<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> haven't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
this is gonna work if you haven't

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
this is gonna work if you haven't
already<00:00:46.260> conceptualized<00:00:46.980> how<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> band

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
already conceptualized how the band

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.020 
already conceptualized how the band
mills<00:00:47.760> work<00:00:48.920> picture<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.190> basically<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> big

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
mills work picture like basically a big

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.580 
mills work picture like basically a big
H<00:00:51.210> frame<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.780> gonna<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.050> welded<00:00:52.440> onto

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
H frame that's gonna be welded onto

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 
H frame that's gonna be welded onto
these<00:00:52.800> legs<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> horizontal<00:00:54.510> bandsaw

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
these legs with the horizontal bandsaw

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.400 
these legs with the horizontal bandsaw
the<00:00:56.160> log<00:00:56.370> lays<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> bed<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> then

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the log lays in the bed here and then

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
the log lays in the bed here and then
this<00:00:58.559> trolley<00:01:01.100> travels<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> outside<00:01:02.760> here

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this trolley travels on the outside here

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
this trolley travels on the outside here
so<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> did<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> could<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so what I did was so I could get the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560 
so what I did was so I could get the
measurements<00:01:05.369> exact<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> don't<00:01:06.150> screw<00:01:06.420> this

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
measurements exact so I don't screw this

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
measurements exact so I don't screw this
up<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.080> build<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.189> whole<00:01:08.430> cutting<00:01:08.820> deck<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
up and build this whole cutting deck and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
up and build this whole cutting deck and
then<00:01:09.510> may<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.500> fit<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> trailer

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
then may have it not fit on this trailer

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
then may have it not fit on this trailer
