right in here now the cool thing about

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.819 
right in here now the cool thing about
this<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:38.850> has<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> docking<00:00:39.510> station

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
this it actually has a docking station

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
this it actually has a docking station
buses<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.010> Chris<00:00:41.520> push<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> button<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
buses but Chris push the button it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420

actually<00:00:42.899> releases<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.559> actual<00:00:44.040> adapter

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
actually releases the actual adapter

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
actually releases the actual adapter
itself<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> could<00:00:45.090> bring<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> another

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
itself so you could bring it to another

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
itself so you could bring it to another
vehicle<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.770> case<00:00:46.980> we'll<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.280> doing

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
vehicle in this case we'll be doing

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.209 
vehicle in this case we'll be doing
three<00:00:47.850> total<00:00:48.180> vehicles<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.289> got<00:00:49.410> Dodge<00:00:49.649> Alexis

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
three total vehicles we got Dodge Alexis

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
three total vehicles we got Dodge Alexis
and<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> GMC<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:51.930> stay<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
adapter in to go ahead and opened up the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
adapter in to go ahead and opened up the
column<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.479> basically<00:01:06.479> has

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
column here as you can see basically has

access all my wires and I found that the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.090 
access all my wires and I found that the
cigarette<00:01:10.170> lighter<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.710> vehicle<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
cigarette lighter in this vehicle is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
cigarette lighter in this vehicle is
actually<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> true<00:01:11.520> accessory<00:01:12.049> gonna<00:01:13.049> be

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
actually a true accessory gonna be

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.929 
actually a true accessory gonna be
tapping<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> cigarette<00:01:13.950> lighter<00:01:14.130> for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
tapping into the cigarette lighter for

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
tapping into the cigarette lighter for
my<00:01:15.030> power<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.479> auto<00:01:15.630> net<00:01:15.810> adapter<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
my power to my auto net adapter now this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.770 
my power to my auto net adapter now this
is<00:01:16.560> definitely<00:01:16.830> okay<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
is definitely okay to use and it's a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.210 
is definitely okay to use and it's a
very<00:01:18.960> low<00:01:19.140> voltage<00:01:19.290> product<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.009> going

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
very low voltage product it's not going

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.980 
very low voltage product it's not going
to<00:01:20.280> draw<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> amperage<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.840> anything

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to draw a lot of amperage or anything

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.940 
to draw a lot of amperage or anything
like<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> blow<00:01:22.890> any

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
like that it's not going to blow any

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
like that it's not going to blow any
fuses<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.479> more<00:01:25.200> than<00:01:25.320> perfect

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
fuses so this is more than perfect

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.520 
fuses so this is more than perfect
enough<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> power<00:01:26.310> source<00:01:26.960> as<00:01:27.960> well<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.439> be

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
enough for a power source as well and be

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.800 
enough for a power source as well and be
utilizing<00:01:29.009> tea<00:01:29.220> taps<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.790> tap<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> wire

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.600 

chomps<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.930> gives<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.220> output

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
chomps down gives you a little output

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
chomps down gives you a little output
right<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:36.720> gonna<00:01:36.840> attach<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.619> male

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right here we gonna attach a male

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
right here we gonna attach a male
adapter<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> people<00:01:41.250> are

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
adapter you know a lot of people are

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.710 
adapter you know a lot of people are
against<00:01:41.610> tea<00:01:41.729> taps<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.119> t-tops<00:01:42.570> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
against tea taps because t-tops can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.649 
against tea taps because t-tops can
actually<00:01:42.960> pop<00:01:43.170> off<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> wire<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.369> cases

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
actually pop off the wire in some cases
