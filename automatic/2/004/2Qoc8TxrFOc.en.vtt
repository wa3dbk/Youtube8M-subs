00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
there's a I assume but you know Vegeta

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060 
there's a I assume but you know Vegeta
doesn't<00:01:54.360> kill<00:01:54.540> anymore<00:01:54.780> he's<00:01:55.439> changed<00:01:55.950> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
doesn't kill anymore he's changed in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.600 
doesn't kill anymore he's changed in
that<00:01:56.219> category<00:01:57.469> in<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.649> department<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.219> he

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that category in that department but he

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
that category in that department but he
definitely<00:02:00.119> wanted<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> train<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.200> that's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
definitely wanted to train more that's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
definitely wanted to train more that's
why<00:02:01.619> he<00:02:01.829> wanted<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> add<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> space<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.820> get<00:02:03.630> even

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
why he wanted to add a space to get even

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.340 
why he wanted to add a space to get even
stronger<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.450> Vegeta<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.689> character<00:02:07.320> in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
stronger so Vegeta is a character in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320 
stronger so Vegeta is a character in
Dragon<00:02:07.710> Ball<00:02:07.740> Absalon<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> really
