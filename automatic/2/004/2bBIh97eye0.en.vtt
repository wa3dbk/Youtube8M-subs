00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
unifying force between all of us and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.449 
unifying force between all of us and
ultimately<00:02:02.079> that's<00:02:02.259> why<00:02:02.469> we<00:02:02.649> all<00:02:02.799> strip<00:02:03.310> down

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
ultimately that's why we all strip down

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.969

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
to our skivvies and show the world

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.160 
to our skivvies and show the world
because<00:02:06.549> we<00:02:06.700> love<00:02:06.819> walking<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.299> much<00:02:07.479> yes
