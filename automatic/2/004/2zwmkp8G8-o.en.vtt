00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
Reverse and everything is working now I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
Reverse and everything is working now I
did<00:01:30.780> put<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.140> electric<00:01:31.560> fuel<00:01:31.799> pump<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
did put in electric fuel pump on it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
did put in electric fuel pump on it
because<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.600> tank<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> under<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> seat<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
because my tank is under the seat and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.780 
because my tank is under the seat and
it's<00:01:35.159> below<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.579> carburetor<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.700> an

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it's below the carburetor so it's got an

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.310 
it's below the carburetor so it's got an
electric<00:01:39.119> fuel<00:01:39.329> pump<00:01:39.600> whether<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> wants<00:01:40.259> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
electric fuel pump whether it wants it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.609 
electric fuel pump whether it wants it
or<00:01:40.439> not

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
or not

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.730 
or not
there's<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> Charlaine<00:01:41.700> motor<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.299> there

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
there's a Charlaine motor right there

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
there's a Charlaine motor right there
and<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.409> awful<00:01:46.740> small<00:01:46.979> motor<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and it's an awful small motor but it's a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.429 
and it's an awful small motor but it's a
thousand<00:01:48.810> rpm<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> found<00:01:49.890> about<00:01:50.520> top<00:01:50.970> speed<00:01:51.540> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
thousand rpm I found about top speed but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.639 
thousand rpm I found about top speed but
off<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.490> torque<00:01:54.409> they've<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
off a lot of torque they've got a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
off a lot of torque they've got a
terrible<00:01:56.100> amount<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> torque<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.180> it's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
terrible amount of torque and it's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.500 
terrible amount of torque and it's
number<00:01:57.960> 60<00:01:58.380> chained<00:01:59.630> down<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.320 

I<00:02:05.070> don't<00:02:06.070> know<00:02:06.250> if<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.460> could<00:02:06.670> see<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.120> in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
I don't know if you could see it in

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.530 
I don't know if you could see it in
there<00:02:08.250> chain<00:02:09.250> goes<00:02:09.460> down<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> drive<00:02:10.180> shaft

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
that runs the front and rear

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.370 
that runs the front and rear
differential<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:15.630> that's<00:02:16.630> about<00:02:16.870> as<00:02:16.990> far<00:02:17.230> as

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
differential and that's about as far as

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.260 
differential and that's about as far as
I've<00:02:17.500> gotten<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.710> runs<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.400> I'll<00:02:21.700> start<00:02:22.090> it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
I've gotten and it runs so I'll start it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.530
