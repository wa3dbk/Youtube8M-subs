with<00:03:29.999> the<00:03:30.150> lipstick<00:03:30.540> pickup<00:04:01.730> now<00:04:02.730> we're<00:04:02.849> gonna

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
with the lipstick pickup now we're gonna

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.610 
with the lipstick pickup now we're gonna
switch<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> middle<00:04:03.569> pickup<00:04:06.560> it's<00:04:07.560> a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
switch to the middle pickup it's a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.770 
switch to the middle pickup it's a
little<00:04:07.980> less<00:04:08.189> punchy<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.269> sound<00:04:09.569> so

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
little less punchy for that sound so

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:28.930 
little less punchy for that sound so
we'll<00:04:10.049> go<00:04:10.169> for<00:04:10.349> something<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:11.639> little<00:04:11.819> more

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.070 

so<00:04:29.940> now<00:04:30.270> we're<00:04:30.480> gonna<00:04:30.570> kick<00:04:30.720> on<00:04:30.870> some

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
so now we're gonna kick on some

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.930 
so now we're gonna kick on some
distortion<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.680> give<00:04:32.280> us<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.460> chance<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.700> hear

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
distortion and give us a chance to hear

00:04:32.940 --> 00:05:45.690 
distortion and give us a chance to hear
what<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.150> sounds<00:04:33.300> like

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.280 

so<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:47.240> kind<00:05:47.480> of<00:05:47.540> sums<00:05:47.750> up<00:05:47.900> what<00:05:48.140> this

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
so that kind of sums up what this

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.080 
so that kind of sums up what this
