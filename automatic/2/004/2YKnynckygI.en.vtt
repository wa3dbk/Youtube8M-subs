alright<00:00:03.510> thanks<00:00:03.870> for<00:00:04.020> tuning<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.560> shooting

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
alright thanks for tuning in shooting

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.169 
alright thanks for tuning in shooting
out<00:00:05.430> or<00:00:05.640> whatever<00:00:07.580> today<00:00:08.580> I'm<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> talk

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
out or whatever today I'm going to talk

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.600 
out or whatever today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:11.780> top-load<00:00:12.780> washer<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.280> older

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
about a top-load washer this is older

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.480 
about a top-load washer this is older
style<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.299> used<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:16.139> design<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.279> used

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
style but it's used this design is used

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.679 
style but it's used this design is used
in<00:00:17.670> many<00:00:17.820> models<00:00:18.240> currently<00:00:18.990> today<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:21.240> basis

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
in many models currently today the basis

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
in many models currently today the basis
basic<00:00:22.170> direct<00:00:22.769> drive<00:00:22.949> design<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.400> anyway

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
basic direct drive design and so anyway

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.269 
basic direct drive design and so anyway
this<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> noisy<00:00:28.050> machine<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this this was a noisy machine so it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.950 
this this was a noisy machine so it
would<00:00:29.429> be<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.939> noisy<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.720> spin<00:00:31.759> and<00:00:32.960> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
would be really noisy and a spin and so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.850 
would be really noisy and a spin and so
basically<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> look<00:00:35.329> at<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:37.020> top<00:00:37.380> you'll

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
basically if you look at this top you'll

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.100 
basically if you look at this top you'll
see<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.430> there's<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:39.030> others<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> hole<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
see that there's some others a hole in

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
see that there's some others a hole in
it<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.579> scraped<00:00:42.180> around<00:00:42.690> there

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it right there it's scraped around there

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.470 
it right there it's scraped around there
and<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> look<00:00:47.010> inside<00:00:47.280> you'll<00:00:48.149> see

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and so and if you look inside you'll see

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.830 
and so and if you look inside you'll see
that<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.200> edge<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.710> worn<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.719> what<00:00:51.719> had

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that the edge is worn and what had

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.580 
that the edge is worn and what had
happened<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> top<00:00:55.370> lip<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> barrel

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
happened is the top lip of the barrel

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.599 
happened is the top lip of the barrel
has<00:00:59.309> come<00:00:59.730> loose<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.609> freely

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
has come loose and so it was like freely

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
has come loose and so it was like freely
spinning<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> wanted<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
spinning the way it wanted to and it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.270 
spinning the way it wanted to and it
basically<00:01:04.979> swapped<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:06.000> over<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> place

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
basically swapped all over the place

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.340 
basically swapped all over the place
8<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:09.360> big<00:01:09.600> holes<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> top<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
8 some big holes in the top of this and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.770 
8 some big holes in the top of this and
luckily<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.740> got<00:01:15.530> more<00:01:16.530> parts<00:01:17.540> tons<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
luckily I've got more parts tons of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.560 
luckily I've got more parts tons of
parts<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.619> need<00:01:19.799> any<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.310> parts<00:01:20.850> let<00:01:21.450> me

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
parts if you need any use parts let me

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.859 
parts if you need any use parts let me
know<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.650> might<00:01:23.159> might<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:26.869> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
know and I might might have it and so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.280 
know and I might might have it and so
anyway<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.880> top<00:01:30.270> lip<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:33.290> just

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
anyway this top lip here is just

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.460 
anyway this top lip here is just
basically<00:01:34.470> worn<00:01:35.159> away<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.470> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
basically worn away as you can see and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.969 
basically worn away as you can see and
so<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> problem<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> I'll

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so that was the problem and so I'll

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.810 
so that was the problem and so I'll
either<00:01:41.280> need<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.790> repair<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:43.820> get

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
either need to repair this or get

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.340 
either need to repair this or get
another<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.750> fix<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.520> properly<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
another one to fix this properly and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.060 
another one to fix this properly and
then<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.560> I'll<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.009> I'll<00:01:50.729> glue<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.540> back

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
then what I'll do is I'll glue it back

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.899 
then what I'll do is I'll glue it back
down<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> basket<00:01:55.640> next<00:01:56.640> time<00:01:57.469> with<00:01:58.909> my

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
down to the basket next time with my

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.480 
down to the basket next time with my
favorite<00:02:00.329> glue<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.909> don't<00:02:03.149> smell<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.540> cuz

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
favorite glue but don't smell it cuz

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
favorite glue but don't smell it cuz
it's<00:02:05.490> gnarly<00:02:06.170> anyway<00:02:07.170> that's<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.500> tip<00:02:07.770> for
