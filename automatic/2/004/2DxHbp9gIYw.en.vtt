00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.420 
just Windows 7 starter edition so it's
nothing<00:04:47.550> like<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.970> Windows<00:04:48.270> 7<00:04:48.449> home<00:04:49.430> the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
nothing like the Windows 7 home the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.740 
nothing like the Windows 7 home the
Windows<00:04:50.699> 7<00:04:50.970> home<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.300> definitely<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.599> lot

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
Windows 7 home is definitely a lot

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.839 
Windows 7 home is definitely a lot
better<00:04:51.960> but<00:04:52.229> for<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.590> size<00:04:52.800> computer<00:04:53.400> it

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
better but for this size computer it

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.270 
better but for this size computer it
probably<00:04:54.240> can't<00:04:54.419> take<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:55.620> much<00:04:55.889> storage

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280
