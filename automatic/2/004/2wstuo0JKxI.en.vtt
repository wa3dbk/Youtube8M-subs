00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.740
 I think I was going to start rapping but 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.110
 it is not necessary we are seeing a mod a 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.169
 jetpack great if you look is the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.180

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.030

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.329

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.360

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.640
 recognized France is stolen is not a 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.770
 porn actor but good is a youtuber of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.140
 france who did this mode is great or 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.390
 it seems real this is the closest thing 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.250
 that we are going to see at the moment the jet 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.800
 pack equal when the game is ready to 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 pc we can see something else and good them 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.340
 I said when when the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.540
 jetpack would have something related the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.710
 jetpack the only thing I was going to do is 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:12.070
 say one thing that is very cool super 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.930
 well done out there I saw other mod but he 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.390
 he did two that I liked a lot this is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.330
 the first is great blue color 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.479
 a little galactic space and the other 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.060
 It has fire and it's like a metal 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.890
 like the engine of a car or something like that 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.560
 we see a good astronaut is not a 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.300
 astronaut is a space reinier who are 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.790
 those that appear on TV and are in the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.890
 cinema flying with this with a little bit of 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.500
 fire the animation is pretty good 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.240
 made and it was simply epic when I saw 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 this when I wrote to him that if he could 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.990
 go up to my channel his bikes told me that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.820
 gÃ¼ey bone itself is a jetpack you is 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.100
 follow the jetpack today a curious youtube 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.289
 you are flying in the jetpack is super 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.729
 well done super fun and it makes me 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.509
 rare that nobody could have done it 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.960
 until now 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.300
 this is for xbox or for play or something like 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.610
 for a console is not for pc what 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.310
 which makes it even more difficult for the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.350
 have done this is pretty father to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.240
 I liked more the space the first 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.649
 the second also looks very good without 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.119
 However, I think the youngest is the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.209
 first the spatial one looks like more 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.850
 galactic most alien plus jetpack already 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.430
 I do not know what you think, basically 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.350
 my channel is consumed in jetpack and they 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.780
 I'm teaching a mold the jetpack or 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.090
 is is great is epic is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.340
 cool I hope you liked it 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.980
 cortitos the mods basically it's like a 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 showcase or teach him what they finish 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.819
 to do or this way in general so that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.340
 can you see it, do you like it if you're 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.010
 in favor of the mistreatment of the jetpack leave your 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.600
 I like it if you like it like it says 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.220
