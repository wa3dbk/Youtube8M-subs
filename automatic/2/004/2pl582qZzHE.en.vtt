00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
these two unplug this one is really hard

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.100 
these two unplug this one is really hard
to<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.020> off<00:01:16.200> online<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.840> lip

around<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.369> tabs<00:01:20.580> would

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
around here these little tabs would

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.260 
around here these little tabs would
actually<00:01:21.390> hook<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:24.380> rotor<00:01:25.380> head

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
actually hook it on to the rotor head

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.580 
actually hook it on to the rotor head
and<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> put<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.840> new<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.259> just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and so when you put your new one on just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:43.450 
and so when you put your new one on just
of<00:01:28.680> course<00:01:28.920> hook<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> wires

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.770 

if<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> heated<00:01:44.970> Mary<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.360> I'll<00:01:45.480> make<00:01:45.660> sure

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
if it's a heated Mary and I'll make sure

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
if it's a heated Mary and I'll make sure
you<00:01:45.870> put<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.230> there<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.670> don't<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you put it on there I don't think you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.160 
you put it on there I don't think you
could<00:01:48.120> really<00:01:48.300> put<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.690> other<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
could really put it the other way I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
could really put it the other way I
guess<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> wires<00:01:49.650> might<00:01:49.980> reach<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.550> pulled

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
guess the wires might reach you pulled

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.690 
guess the wires might reach you pulled

press like where that circle is then you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:15.440 
press like where that circle is then you
want<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> rotate<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.950> mirror<00:02:05.160> around<00:02:14.450> make

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
want to rotate the mirror around make

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.150 
want to rotate the mirror around make
sure<00:02:15.480> snapped<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> way<00:02:16.590> around

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
sure snapped on all the way around

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.330 
sure snapped on all the way around
and<00:02:17.880> that's<00:02:18.030> it
