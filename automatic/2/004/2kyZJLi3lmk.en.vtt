what I'm going to be showing you it's

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.880 
what I'm going to be showing you it's
called<00:00:59.250> slow<00:00:59.549> fast<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.659> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> speeding

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
called slow fast so this is a speeding

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
called slow fast so this is a speeding
up<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.369> down<00:01:02.670> app<00:01:02.939> and<00:01:03.269> I<00:01:03.479> basically<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
up and down app and I basically use this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.179 
up and down app and I basically use this
because<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.790> iPad<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.680> edit

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
because on my iPad when I actually edit

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.580 
because on my iPad when I actually edit
on<00:01:08.280> my<00:01:08.369> iPad<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.120> doesn't<00:01:09.600> let<00:01:09.810> me<00:01:09.840> speed<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
on my iPad it doesn't let me speed up it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
on my iPad it doesn't let me speed up it
only<00:01:10.680> lets<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.010> slow<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:12.300> I'm<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.750> going

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
only lets me slow down so I'm just going

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.890 
only lets me slow down so I'm just going
to<00:01:12.990> pick<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> video<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:15.030> filmed<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
to pick a video I actually just filmed a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.280 
to pick a video I actually just filmed a
clip<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.010> room<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.640> show<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.140> will

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
clip of my room to show you and it will

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
clip of my room to show you and it will
basically<00:01:19.470> speed<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.190> up<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> just

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
basically speed it up and you can just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.100 
basically speed it up and you can just
keep<00:01:20.970> speeding<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.540> by<00:01:21.720> keeping

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
keep speeding it up by keeping

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.110 
keep speeding it up by keeping
compressing<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.710> video<00:01:22.980> and<00:01:23.250> I'll<00:01:23.760> just<00:01:23.910> add

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
compressing the video and I'll just add

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.430

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and then you could resize it and move it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.510 
and then you could resize it and move it
around<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.740> how<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.190> opaque

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
around so this is how I get that opaque

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.970 
around so this is how I get that opaque
and<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.060> click<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.570> um<00:02:24.980> box

down<00:02:26.280> here<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.850> then<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.090> change<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
down here and then I can change the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.070 
down here and then I can change the
opacity<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.330> can<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.840> really

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
opacity of it so it can be like really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.530 
opacity of it so it can be like really
clear<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.150> actually<00:02:33.240> change

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
clear and then you can actually change

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.880 
clear and then you can actually change
the<00:02:33.660> color<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.230> well<00:02:34.380> which<00:02:34.500> i<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:34.650> is

were asking me how I make my pictures
stay<00:02:59.790> straight<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.140> use<00:03:01.260> these

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
stay straight so you have to use these

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.950 
stay straight so you have to use these
two<00:03:01.440> little<00:03:01.800> icons<00:03:01.920> here<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.700> i<00:03:02.880> zoom<00:03:03.510> out<00:03:03.720> as

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
two little icons here so i zoom out as

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.890 
two little icons here so i zoom out as
far<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.310> clicking<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.120> both<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.660> them

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.960 
far as I can clicking on both of them
and<00:03:07.380> then<00:03:07.620> they<00:03:07.770> should<00:03:07.950> hopefully<00:03:08.190> stay<00:03:08.730> in

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
and then they should hopefully stay in

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.710 
and then they should hopefully stay in
the<00:03:09.090> same<00:03:09.300> place<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.050> then<00:03:10.820> as<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.000> do<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.420> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the same place and then as I do this it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.690 
the same place and then as I do this it
will<00:03:12.870> stop<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.710> text<00:03:14.070> will<00:03:14.220> come<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.520> it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
will stop and you text will come on it

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.580 
will stop and you text will come on it
so<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.210> really<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.020> how<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.350> looks
