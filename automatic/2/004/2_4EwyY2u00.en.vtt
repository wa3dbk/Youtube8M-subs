00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
well think I've made good decisions and
couldn't<00:02:22.650> really<00:02:23.280> ask<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:24.030> better<00:02:24.150> script

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
than I want and how do you approach that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.449 
than I want and how do you approach that
sort<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:26.970> shootout<00:02:27.420> format<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.110> TV<00:02:28.440> format<00:02:28.830> I

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
sort of shootout format the TV format I

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.070 
sort of shootout format the TV format I
approached<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.420> i<00:02:30.510> think<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.780> little<00:02:30.930> bit

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
approached it i think a little bit

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.650 
approached it i think a little bit
different<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.560> most<00:02:31.860> people<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.660> previously

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660

guarantees the oil and then find my

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.259 
guarantees the oil and then find my
spots<00:02:41.220> whether<00:02:41.430> that's<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.640> called<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.000> shovin

thought<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.670> field<00:02:47.910> was<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.180> tough

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
thought that the field was really tough

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.550 
thought that the field was really tough
and<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:48.690> most<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.050> players<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.440> going

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.720 
and then most of the players was going
to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.680> doing<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:50.010> playing<00:02:50.370> tight<00:02:50.550> and

what we think about the hands and just

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.590 
what we think about the hands and just
try<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:09.610> improve<00:05:09.910> each<00:05:10.060> other's<00:05:10.270> game<00:05:10.420> all

the<00:05:10.660> time<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.140> think<00:05:11.200> that's<00:05:11.440> one<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.620> the

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
the time and I think that's one of the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.440 
the time and I think that's one of the
main<00:05:11.860> reasons<00:05:12.190> why<00:05:12.790> we're<00:05:13.000> doing<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:13.330> well

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
main reasons why we're doing so well

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.660 
main reasons why we're doing so well
lately<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.810> was<00:05:14.050> any<00:05:14.770> marginal<00:05:15.160> spots<00:05:15.430> or

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
lately it was any marginal spots or

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.040 
lately it was any marginal spots or
decision<00:05:16.030> we<00:05:16.120> have<00:05:16.270> with<00:05:16.480> discussing<00:05:16.900> it

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
decision we have with discussing it

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.490 
decision we have with discussing it
amongst<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.470> load<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.490> other<00:05:18.790> good<00:05:19.060> players<00:05:19.240> and

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
amongst a load of other good players and

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.390 
amongst a load of other good players and
working<00:05:20.500> out<00:05:20.620> all<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.830> best<00:05:20.980> players<00:05:21.250> and

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
working out all the best players and

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.850 
working out all the best players and
things<00:05:21.700> like<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:21.880> so<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:23.110> think<00:05:23.560> that's<00:05:23.710> one

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
things like that so I think that's one

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.990 
things like that so I think that's one
of<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:23.950> reasons<00:05:24.280> why<00:05:24.370> we<00:05:24.490> got<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:24.700> many<00:05:24.760> titles

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
of the reasons why we got so many titles

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.300 
of the reasons why we got so many titles
this<00:05:25.240> year<00:05:25.420> well<00:05:26.320> hopefully<00:05:26.560> more<00:05:26.920> successes

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
this year well hopefully more successes

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.160 
this year well hopefully more successes
can<00:05:27.610> follow<00:05:27.820> over<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.090> next<00:05:28.360> few<00:05:28.510> weeks<00:05:28.720> says
