you just want this thing to fall right
into<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.350> hand<00:03:04.590> okay<00:03:04.890> now<00:03:05.549> we're<00:03:05.640> gonna<00:03:05.700> do

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
into this hand okay now we're gonna do

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.789 
into this hand okay now we're gonna do
the<00:03:06.030> same<00:03:06.269> trick<00:03:06.540> only<00:03:06.810> we're<00:03:07.230> gonna<00:03:07.350> add<00:03:07.530> one

the same trick only we're gonna add one

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.140 
the same trick only we're gonna add one
little<00:03:07.920> rotation<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.579> so<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.910> gonna<00:03:09.000> go

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
little rotation to it so it's gonna go

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.620 
little rotation to it so it's gonna go
like<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.450> ready<00:03:09.890> one<00:03:10.890> rotation<00:03:11.630> one

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
like this ready one rotation one

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.590 
like this ready one rotation one
rotation<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:14.220> rotation<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.360> big

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
rotation one rotation it's not a big

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.900 
rotation one rotation it's not a big
deal<00:03:15.860> once<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.130> comfortable<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.760> one

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
deal once you get comfortable that one

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.039 
deal once you get comfortable that one
rotation<00:03:18.239> though<00:03:18.480> we're<00:03:18.660> gonna<00:03:18.750> move<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.019> to

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
rotation though we're gonna move on to

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.750 
rotation though we're gonna move on to
two<00:03:19.350> rotations<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.400> gonna<00:03:20.609> be

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
two rotations and this is gonna be

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.460 
two rotations and this is gonna be
