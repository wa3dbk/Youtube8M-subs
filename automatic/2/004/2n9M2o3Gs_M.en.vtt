take damage in the safe zone and then

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.860 
take damage in the safe zone and then
when<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.069> leave<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.720> say

wilderness<00:03:10.379> then<00:03:10.620> when<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.860> come<00:03:10.980> back<00:03:11.040> in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
wilderness then when you come back in

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.300 
wilderness then when you come back in
and<00:03:12.540> then<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:12.989> also<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.620> no<00:03:13.799> blocks<00:03:14.010> balls

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
and then you can also so no blocks balls

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.800 
and then you can also so no blocks balls
to<00:03:14.459> be<00:03:14.549> able<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.909> be<00:03:15.030> changed<00:03:15.359> in<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.599> safe

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
to be able to be changed in the safe

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.229 
to be able to be changed in the safe
zone<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.319> then<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.680> also<00:03:16.799> do<00:03:17.659> /f<00:03:18.659> claim<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
zone and then you can also do /f claim I

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.059 
zone and then you can also do /f claim I
think<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.390> can<00:03:21.599> just<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:22.109> do<00:03:22.290> war<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.859> then

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
think you can just just do war and then

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.009 
think you can just just do war and then
this<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.400> war<00:03:23.639> zone<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.209> again<00:03:24.540> no<00:03:24.569> blocks

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
this is a war zone so again no blocks

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.619 
this is a war zone so again no blocks
can<00:03:25.200> be<00:03:25.260> broken<00:03:26.120> but<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.269> can<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.489> pvp<00:03:30.480> in

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
can be broken but you can you can pvp in

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.149 
can be broken but you can you can pvp in
this<00:03:30.810> zone<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.409> would<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.620> great<00:03:31.769> for<00:03:31.889> an

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
this zone so this would be great for an

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.210 
this zone so this would be great for an
arena<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:34.440> safe<00:03:34.709> zone<00:03:34.950> would<00:03:35.099> be

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
arena and then the safe zone would be

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.099 
arena and then the safe zone would be
great<00:03:35.459> for<00:03:35.670> spawn<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.019> show
