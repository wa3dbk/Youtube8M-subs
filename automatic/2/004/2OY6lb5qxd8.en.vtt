chunky<00:01:07.330> twist<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.810> then<00:01:08.080> divided<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.799> into<00:01:09.040> two

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
chunky twist I then divided it into two

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.789 
chunky twist I then divided it into two
smaller<00:01:09.640> sections<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:10.840> now<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.049> divide<00:01:11.619> that

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
smaller sections so now I divide that

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.640 
smaller sections so now I divide that
section<00:01:12.280> into<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.820> even<00:01:13.180> section<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:13.840> then<00:01:14.440> I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
section into to even section and then I

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.740 
section into to even section and then I
take<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.159> divided<00:01:15.759> section<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.360> divide<00:01:16.720> it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
take that divided section and divide it

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.680 
take that divided section and divide it
into<00:01:17.170> two<00:01:17.619> even<00:01:18.009> sections<00:01:18.430> again<00:01:18.640> now<00:01:19.360> i<00:01:19.390> have

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
into two even sections again now i have

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.260 
into two even sections again now i have
three<00:01:20.080> strands<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.680> then<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.220> begin<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.790> braid
