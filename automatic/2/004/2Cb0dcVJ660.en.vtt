the<00:02:36.030> block<00:02:36.270> try<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.660> do<00:02:36.870> something<00:02:37.080> different

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the block try to do something different

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.850 
the block try to do something different
like<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.770> scuf<00:02:38.220> gaming<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.880> example<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.650> I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
like a scuf gaming for example and I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.530 
like a scuf gaming for example and I
think<00:02:40.920> that's<00:02:41.100> are<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> really

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
think that's are going to be a really

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.480 
think that's are going to be a really
interesting<00:02:42.950> topic<00:02:43.950> for<00:02:44.340> discussion

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490
