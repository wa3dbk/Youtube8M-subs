small<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:19.630> too<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.260> i<00:02:21.670> don't<00:02:22.670> know

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
small little too like that i don't know

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.200 
small little too like that i don't know
i<00:02:23.390> mean<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.440> okay<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.370> nice<00:02:25.670> product

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
i mean it is okay it is a nice product

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.420 
i mean it is okay it is a nice product
it<00:02:26.480> does<00:02:26.750> illuminate<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.800> that's<00:02:28.010> pretty

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it does illuminate and that's pretty

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.050 
it does illuminate and that's pretty
much<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.700> only<00:02:28.910> reason<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.600> i<00:02:29.780> use<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.350> is

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
much the only reason that i use it is

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.570 
much the only reason that i use it is
because<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.210> has<00:02:32.360> more<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.580> shiny

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
because it has more of a like shiny

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.940 
because it has more of a like shiny
effect<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.780> other<00:02:36.260> ones<00:02:36.530> they're<00:02:36.710> just

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
effect and the other ones they're just

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.270 
effect and the other ones they're just
mad<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.130> probably<00:02:40.540> can't<00:02:41.540> see<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.780> anymore

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
mad so you probably can't see it anymore

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.190 
mad so you probably can't see it anymore
but<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.990> can<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:47.240> has<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> really<00:02:47.870> odd

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
but like I can and it has a really odd

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
but like I can and it has a really odd
texture<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.459> like<00:02:49.640> kind<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.060> tacky<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
texture it's like kind of tacky and I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.150 
texture it's like kind of tacky and I
don't<00:02:52.520> like<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.630> much<00:02:53.870> because<00:02:54.140> if<00:02:54.860> any

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
don't like that that much because if any

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.690 
don't like that that much because if any
like<00:02:55.910> stuff<00:02:56.720> from<00:02:56.900> eyes<00:02:57.260> falls<00:02:58.100> out<00:02:58.370> it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
like stuff from eyes falls out it's

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.790 
like stuff from eyes falls out it's
going<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.120> stick<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.900> right<00:03:00.170> away<00:03:00.350> and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
going to stick to that right away and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.920 
going to stick to that right away and
it's<00:03:01.280> going<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.520> be<00:03:01.700> hard<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.390> wipe<00:03:02.660> off

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it's going to be hard to just wipe off

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.290 
it's going to be hard to just wipe off
because<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.800> going<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.100> stick<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.910> even

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
because it is going to stick to it even

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.229 
because it is going to stick to it even
more<00:03:05.510> than<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.740> regular<00:03:06.890> concealer<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.290> I

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
more than a regular concealer one so I

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.410 
more than a regular concealer one so I
don't<00:03:11.239> know<00:03:11.390> about<00:03:11.600> was<00:03:11.900> guys<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:13.209> I'm<00:03:14.209> going

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
don't know about was guys like I'm going

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.190 
don't know about was guys like I'm going
to<00:03:14.540> cover<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.959> my<00:03:15.140> little<00:03:15.350> scar

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.390 

using<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.280> brush<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.720> don't<00:03:22.020> really<00:03:22.400> find

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
using the brush that I don't really find

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.540 
using the brush that I don't really find
a<00:03:23.610> use<00:03:23.819> for<00:03:23.849> usually<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:29.300> mean<00:03:31.010> yeah<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.340> did

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
a use for usually I mean yeah it did

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.589 
a use for usually I mean yeah it did
okay<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:34.800> doesn't<00:03:35.340> cover<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:36.420> it

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
okay but it doesn't cover it like it

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.640 
okay but it doesn't cover it like it
says<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.290> does<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.130> can<00:03:38.250> still<00:03:38.610> see<00:03:38.940> it

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
says that it does you can still see it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.009 
says that it does you can still see it
it's<00:03:40.650> basically<00:03:41.250> an<00:03:41.489> illuminating<00:03:42.269> concealer

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
it's basically an illuminating concealer

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.720 
it's basically an illuminating concealer
it<00:03:43.200> doesn't<00:03:43.470> really<00:03:43.560> conceal<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.459> just

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
it doesn't really conceal it just

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.539 
it doesn't really conceal it just
illuminates<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.290> think<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.220> should<00:03:47.400> be

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
illuminates so I think that it should be

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.640 
illuminates so I think that it should be
called<00:03:47.760> either<00:03:48.090> highlighter<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:49.110> an

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
called either highlighter or an

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.589 
called either highlighter or an
illuminator<00:03:50.220> because<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.360> not<00:03:51.540> a

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
illuminator because it is not a

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.259 
illuminator because it is not a
concealer<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.410> me<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> does<00:03:52.830> not<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:54.060> doesn't

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
concealer to me it does not it doesn't

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.590 
concealer to me it does not it doesn't
really<00:03:54.510> cover<00:03:54.840> anything<00:03:55.260> actually

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.870 

see<00:04:02.600> it's<00:04:02.960> a<00:04:03.080> lot<00:04:03.260> more<00:04:03.290> covered<00:04:03.890> now<00:04:04.070> like

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
see it's a lot more covered now like

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.310 
see it's a lot more covered now like
from<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.150> distance<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.660> can't<00:04:05.900> tell<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.230> i

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
from a distance you can't tell that i

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.560 
from a distance you can't tell that i
have<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.680> but<00:04:06.920> if<00:04:07.130> i<00:04:07.730> were<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.210> put<00:04:08.420> this

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
have it but if i were to just put this

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.440 
have it but if i were to just put this
on<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.290> could<00:04:09.470> tell<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.830> i<00:04:09.860> had<00:04:10.300> so<00:04:11.300> yeah

on it you could tell that i had so yeah

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.710 
on it you could tell that i had so yeah
I<00:04:11.780> have<00:04:12.770> to<00:04:12.920> use<00:04:13.040> three<00:04:13.460> concealers<00:04:14.270> under<00:04:14.600> my

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
I have to use three concealers under my

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.710 
I have to use three concealers under my
eye<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.930> get<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.770> effect<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.670> want<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.299> I

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
think that's kind of ridiculous but yeah

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.420 
think that's kind of ridiculous but yeah
that's<00:04:22.550> how<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.930> really<00:04:24.530> do<00:04:24.770> want<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.160> try

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.880 
i think packaging is docking this
definitely<00:05:16.540> if<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.780> lettering<00:05:18.260> is<00:05:18.440> already

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
definitely if the lettering is already

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.210 
definitely if the lettering is already
coming<00:05:19.130> off<00:05:19.400> just<00:05:20.210> from<00:05:20.980> normal<00:05:21.980> wear<00:05:22.190> and
