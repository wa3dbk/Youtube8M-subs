designed the Iron Man attenuator and he
came<00:03:47.170> up<00:03:47.350> with<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.500> built-in<00:03:48.070> version<00:03:48.609> for<00:03:48.880> the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
came up with a built-in version for the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.690 
came up with a built-in version for the
galaxy<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:50.290> specifically<00:03:50.829> voiced<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.489> this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
galaxy it's specifically voiced for this

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.119 
galaxy it's specifically voiced for this
particular<00:03:52.239> app<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.590> mounts<00:03:54.010> on<00:03:54.069> the

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
particular app it is it mounts on the

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.070 
particular app it is it mounts on the
inside<00:03:54.580> of<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.790> 212<00:03:55.209> cabinet

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
inside of the 212 cabinet

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.930 
inside of the 212 cabinet
and<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.410> go<00:03:56.560> down<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:57.010> view<00:03:57.070> no<00:03:57.400> point<00:03:57.730> oh<00:03:57.880> one

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and it go down to view no point oh one

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.770 
and it go down to view no point oh one
watt<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.350> at<00:03:59.470> 0.01<00:04:00.130> all<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.550> way<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.700> 40<00:04:01.150> DB<00:04:01.540> on

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
watt so at 0.01 all the way to 40 DB on

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.170 
watt so at 0.01 all the way to 40 DB on
the<00:04:01.840> built-in<00:04:02.500> attenuator<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.700> wonderful

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
the built-in attenuator just wonderful

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.120 
the built-in attenuator just wonderful
sounding<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:05.200> could<00:04:05.380> take<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:05.740> and<00:04:05.980> gig

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
sounding so you could take this and gig

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.590 
sounding so you could take this and gig
out<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.460> big<00:04:06.640> venue<00:04:06.850> or<00:04:07.150> play<00:04:07.390> in<00:04:07.480> your

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
bedroom with the built-in attenuator so

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.140 
bedroom with the built-in attenuator so
that's<00:04:09.580> crazy

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
that's crazy

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.630 
that's crazy
yeah<00:04:10.360> it's<00:04:10.600> nuts<00:04:10.780> that's<00:04:11.140> out<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.350> this<00:04:11.470> world

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
yeah it's nuts that's out of this world

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.170 
yeah it's nuts that's out of this world
that's<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.850> name<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.750> galaxy<00:04:14.230> galaxy<00:04:15.180> well

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
that's the name the galaxy galaxy well

at<00:05:36.420> the<00:05:36.570> at<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.350> lower<00:05:37.530> volumes<00:05:37.920> but<00:05:38.160> turned

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
at the at the lower volumes but turned

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.160 
at the at the lower volumes but turned
up<00:05:38.610> man<00:05:38.790> it's<00:05:38.940> it's<00:05:39.150> like<00:05:39.300> a<00:05:39.330> tweed<00:05:39.630> twin<00:05:39.930> let's

be honest it's something you turn up at

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.950 
be honest it's something you turn up at
yeah<00:05:41.580> right<00:05:41.970> sounds<00:05:42.270> rocket<00:05:42.570> but<00:05:42.690> I've<00:05:42.780> got<00:05:42.930> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
yeah right sounds rocket but I've got a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.400 
yeah right sounds rocket but I've got a
line

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
line

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.010 
line
just<00:05:44.040> like<00:05:44.190> two<00:05:44.490> right<00:05:44.910> now<00:05:47.660> but<00:05:48.660> it's<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.840> great

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
just like two right now but it's a great

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.440 
just like two right now but it's a great
tone<00:05:49.290> to<00:05:49.500> use<00:05:49.680> as<00:05:49.890> like<00:05:50.040> a<00:05:50.070> starting<00:05:50.520> point<00:05:50.700> so

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
tone to use as like a starting point so

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.760 
tone to use as like a starting point so
you<00:05:51.570> can<00:05:51.630> got<00:05:51.810> just<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.110> little<00:05:52.410> bit<00:05:52.500> of<00:05:52.590> hair<00:05:52.740> on

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
you can got just a little bit of hair on

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:03.650 
you can got just a little bit of hair on
you<00:05:52.950> Lin<00:05:53.100> in<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.340> know<00:06:02.330> then<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.420> hit<00:06:03.540> an

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
you Lin in the know then you hit an

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.110 
you Lin in the know then you hit an
overdrive<00:06:04.170> on<00:06:04.350> top<00:06:04.590> of<00:06:04.770> that

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.730 

and

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.290 

you

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
you

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.750 
you
you

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.360 

good<00:06:22.760> the<00:06:22.880> idea<00:06:23.000> it<00:06:23.990> is<00:06:24.200> big<00:06:24.470> it<00:06:24.710> is<00:06:24.740> bold<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.310> is

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
good the idea it is big it is bold it is

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.650 
good the idea it is big it is bold it is
powerful<00:06:25.970> so<00:06:26.090> I<00:06:26.120> would<00:06:26.210> imagine<00:06:26.390> with<00:06:26.600> that

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
powerful so I would imagine with that

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.210 
powerful so I would imagine with that
attenuator<00:06:27.320> you'd<00:06:27.470> have<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.710> best<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:28.040> all

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
attenuator you'd have the best of all

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.200 
attenuator you'd have the best of all
possible<00:06:28.460> world

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
possible world

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.070 
possible world
absolutely<00:06:29.990> did<00:06:30.230> you<00:06:30.320> certainly<00:06:30.620> got<00:06:30.770> enough

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
absolutely did you certainly got enough

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.230 
absolutely did you certainly got enough
Headroom<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.670> cut<00:06:34.670> heads

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
Headroom to cut heads

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.170 
Headroom to cut heads
you<00:06:36.080> got<00:06:36.320> enough<00:06:36.680> Headroom<00:06:36.950> to<00:06:37.580> cut<00:06:37.790> heads

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
you got enough Headroom to cut heads
