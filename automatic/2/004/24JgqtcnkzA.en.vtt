my model Lincoln is due for his regular
touch-up<00:00:26.730> he<00:00:27.330> doesn't<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.720> his<00:00:27.900> hair<00:00:28.110> too

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
touch-up he doesn't like his hair too

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.519 
touch-up he doesn't like his hair too
short<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:29.040> clean<00:00:29.490> looking<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:31.020> does<00:00:31.260> need

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
short or clean looking so it does need

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
short or clean looking so it does need
to<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.859> shortened<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.580> cleaned<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to be shortened up and cleaned up a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.680 
to be shortened up and cleaned up a
little<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> we're<00:00:34.890> gonna<00:00:34.980> go<00:00:35.190> through<00:00:35.690> cutting

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
little so we're gonna go through cutting

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.660 
little so we're gonna go through cutting
it<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.019> employ<00:00:37.769> a<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:38.370> different

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it and employ a little different

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.090 
it and employ a little different
techniques<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.470> that<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> doesn't

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
techniques in there so that it doesn't

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.270 
techniques in there so that it doesn't
have<00:00:41.220> that<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.699> fresh<00:00:42.059> cut<00:00:42.420> look<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:43.500> we

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
have that really fresh cut look when we

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.729 
have that really fresh cut look when we
shape<00:00:44.640> someone's<00:00:45.150> here<00:00:45.530> we're<00:00:46.530> working

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
shape someone's here we're working

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.729 
shape someone's here we're working
backwards<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.210> bone<00:00:48.360> structure<00:00:48.989> just

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
backwards from the bone structure just

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.220 
backwards from the bone structure just
like<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> woman<00:00:50.340> where<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> utilize<00:00:51.600> makeup<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
like a woman where you utilize makeup to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
like a woman where you utilize makeup to
enhance<00:00:52.590> their<00:00:53.129> features<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.610> also

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
enhance their features and also

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.459 
enhance their features and also
downplayed<00:00:54.540> by<00:00:55.579> highlighting<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:57.110> shading<00:00:58.110> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
downplayed by highlighting or shading so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
downplayed by highlighting or shading so
everything<00:00:58.829> emanates<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.789> bone

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
everything emanates from the bone

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
everything emanates from the bone
structures<00:01:00.450> are<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.750> working<00:01:01.079> backwards<00:01:01.500> from

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
structures are we working backwards from

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
structures are we working backwards from
that's<00:01:01.950> why<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> cut<00:01:02.399> starts<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.329> front

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that's why the cut starts at the front

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.580 
that's why the cut starts at the front
building<00:01:04.640> from<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.789> facial<00:01:05.970> features

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.760 

the<00:01:13.590> hair<00:01:13.770> sections<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.460> being<00:01:14.640> held<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
the hair sections are being held out and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.500 
the hair sections are being held out and
pretty<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> call<00:01:17.909> direction<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
pretty much what I call direction of

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.140 
pretty much what I call direction of
growth<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.290> root<00:01:20.130> area<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.000> I'm

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
growth from the root area so all I'm

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:37.660 
growth from the root area so all I'm
doing<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.450> putting<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.840> angles<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.480 

well<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.730> system<00:01:38.940> was<00:01:39.240> cutting<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.260> teach<00:01:41.250> our

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
well the system was cutting we teach our

stylist<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> called<00:01:42.510> precision<00:01:42.840> cutting<00:01:43.640> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
stylist is called precision cutting this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.850 
stylist is called precision cutting this
is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> variation<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:46.050> we<00:01:46.200> call<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.440> square

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
is a variation of what we call a square

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.540 
is a variation of what we call a square
cut

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
cut

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.400 
cut
I<00:01:47.580> see<00:01:49.220> variation<00:01:50.810> employing<00:01:51.810> precision

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
I see variation employing precision

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.470 
I see variation employing precision
cutting<00:01:52.620> techniques<00:01:53.190> meaning<00:01:53.610> each<00:01:53.820> section

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
cutting techniques meaning each section

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.980 
cutting techniques meaning each section
is<00:01:54.690> pretty<00:01:55.560> much<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> same<00:01:56.250> width<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.810> we're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
is pretty much the same width and we're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
is pretty much the same width and we're
not<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> place<00:01:59.010> we're<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
not going all over the place we're just

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.030 
not going all over the place we're just
building<00:01:59.930> right<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.080> back<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:01.590> we're<00:02:01.770> looking

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
building right on back so we're looking

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.640 
building right on back so we're looking
at<00:02:02.160> guides<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.910> way<00:02:03.260> also<00:02:04.260> when<00:02:04.500> you're

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
at guides all the way also when you're

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.750 
at guides all the way also when you're
cutting<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.660> line<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:07.500> want<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.800> be<00:02:07.890> cutting<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
cutting a line you want to be cutting it

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.910 
cutting a line you want to be cutting it
exactly<00:02:09.300> without<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.840> hair<00:02:10.080> being<00:02:10.649> pushed

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
exactly without that hair being pushed

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
exactly without that hair being pushed
out<00:02:11.070> between<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.640> citizens<00:02:12.030> blades

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:34.620 

really<00:02:21.470> what<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> tip

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.930 

now<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> type<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.760> what<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:37.790> call

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
now this is a type of what we call

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.390 
now this is a type of what we call
shattering<00:02:38.870> technique<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.770> if<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> ends<00:02:40.280> in

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
shattering technique so if the ends in

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.950 
shattering technique so if the ends in
that<00:02:40.550> all<00:02:40.760> blunt<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.720> straight<00:02:41.960> across<00:02:42.940> you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
that all blunt and straight across you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.200 
that all blunt and straight across you
it<00:02:44.960> allows<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.650> hair<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.830> flow<00:02:46.220> easier

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
it allows the hair to flow easier

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.690 
it allows the hair to flow easier
whether<00:02:48.020> you're<00:02:48.170> brushing<00:02:48.830> at<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.220> calming<00:02:49.550> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
whether you're brushing at a calming and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120 
whether you're brushing at a calming and
I<00:02:49.790> just<00:02:50.000> finger<00:02:50.390> combing<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.980> because<00:02:51.980> you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
I just finger combing it because you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.710 
I just finger combing it because you
don't<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:52.430> just<00:02:52.700> straight<00:02:53.240> across<00:02:53.390> both

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
don't have just straight across both

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.040 
don't have just straight across both
ends<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.920> gives<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.280> effect<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:56.050> here

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
ends so it gives the effect of here

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.420 
ends so it gives the effect of here
that's<00:02:57.350> already<00:02:57.530> growing<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.310> like

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
that's already growing out for like

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.670 
that's already growing out for like
about<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.670> couple<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.330> weeks<00:02:59.480> maybe<00:02:59.680> so

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
about a couple of weeks maybe so

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.330
