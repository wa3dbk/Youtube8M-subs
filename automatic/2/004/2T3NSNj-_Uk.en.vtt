you<00:02:11.819> know<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.360> world<00:02:12.599> out

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
you know I think it's like world out

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.580 
you know I think it's like world out
some<00:02:12.840> people<00:02:13.050> call<00:02:13.170> them

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
some people call them

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
some people call them
but<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.099> know<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.459> Queens<00:02:15.000> Knight<00:02:15.209> Kings

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
but you know like Queens Knight Kings

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.500 
but you know like Queens Knight Kings
not<00:02:15.750> Jack's<00:02:16.110> Knight<00:02:16.580> which<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:18.120> kind<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.360> had

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
not Jack's Knight which they kind of had

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.600 
not Jack's Knight which they kind of had
a<00:02:18.540> similar<00:02:19.019> effect<00:02:19.170> as<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.400> whenever

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
a similar effect as in you know whenever

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.420 
a similar effect as in you know whenever
I<00:02:21.030> believe<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.629> was<00:02:21.780> when<00:02:22.590> King<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
I believe it was when King was on the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.830 
I believe it was when King was on the
field<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.790> Queen<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.390> Jackson<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
field and Queen was in Jackson that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.229 
field and Queen was in Jackson that
would<00:02:24.989> come<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:25.800> kind<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.879> same

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
would come out so it's kind of that same

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.550 
would come out so it's kind of that same
strategy<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.260> guess<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.590> could<00:02:28.709> say<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
strategy I guess you could say and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.479 
strategy I guess you could say and
here's<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.799> they<00:02:31.920> all<00:02:32.040> bring<00:02:32.190> out<00:02:32.370> this

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
here's the one they all bring out this

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.309 
here's the one they all bring out this
is<00:02:32.640> supposedly<00:02:33.180> their<00:02:33.450> trump<00:02:33.720> card<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
is supposedly their trump card that

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.920 
is supposedly their trump card that
whenever<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.489> them<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.060> brings<00:02:36.900> out

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
whenever you get them all it brings out

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.160
