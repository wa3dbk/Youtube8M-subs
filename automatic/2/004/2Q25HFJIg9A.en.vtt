the<00:00:50.910> top<00:00:51.149> look<00:00:51.420> fairly<00:00:51.690> similar<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.350> metal

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.020 
and it also looks as if battle strikers
and<00:01:03.090> tornado<00:01:04.049> battlers<00:01:04.589> made<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> baby<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.909> will

and tornado battlers made a baby it will

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.190

video demoing how the new tops work so
here's<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.840> video<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> from<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.959> looks

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
here's the video so from what it looks

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:30.610 
here's the video so from what it looks
like

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
like

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.680 
like
you're<00:02:31.280> basically<00:02:31.640> inserting<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.330> ripcord

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
you're basically inserting the ripcord

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.600 
you're basically inserting the ripcord
hu<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.170> bottom<00:02:33.500> portion<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.100> top<00:02:34.340> and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
hu the bottom portion of the top and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.550 
hu the bottom portion of the top and
then<00:02:34.850> pulling<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.569> out<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.900> when<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.260> pull<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
then pulling it out and when you pull it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.770 
then pulling it out and when you pull it
out<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.950> garo<00:02:37.220> engine<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.819> released<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
out the garo engine is released so the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.900 
out the garo engine is released so the
tops<00:02:39.019> are<00:02:39.170> freely<00:02:39.470> spin<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:40.489> then<00:02:40.700> it's<00:02:40.819> put

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
tops are freely spin you then it's put

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.600 
tops are freely spin you then it's put
talk<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> plate<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:42.950> throw<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.340> top

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
talk on the plate and then throw the top

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.610 
talk on the plate and then throw the top
watching<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.480> paddle<00:02:44.900> straight<00:02:45.200> Gary<00:02:45.410> time

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
watching the paddle straight Gary time

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.520 
watching the paddle straight Gary time
stadiums<00:02:46.299> you're<00:02:47.299> also<00:02:47.480> given<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.019> gimmick<00:02:48.350> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
stadiums you're also given a gimmick to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
stadiums you're also given a gimmick to
control<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.160> top<00:02:49.400> by<00:02:49.640> pulling<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.180> releasing

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
control the top by pulling or releasing

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.770 
control the top by pulling or releasing
the<00:02:50.810> launcher<00:02:51.200> spring<00:02:51.860> mechanism<00:02:52.549> type<00:02:53.420> thing

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the launcher spring mechanism type thing

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.430 
the launcher spring mechanism type thing
yeah

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
yeah

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.770 
yeah
I<00:02:54.470> don't<00:02:54.799> even<00:02:54.920> know<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.970> me<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.330> think<00:02:56.360> it's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
I don't even know but to me I think it's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.479 
I don't even know but to me I think it's
actually<00:02:56.900> really<00:02:57.410> really<00:02:57.530> cool<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.280> really

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
actually really really cool and a really

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.729 
actually really really cool and a really
good<00:02:58.640> idea<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:59.269> by<00:02:59.510> taking<00:03:00.049> some<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.530> those

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
good idea just by taking some of those

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.210 
good idea just by taking some of those
ideas<00:03:00.950> from<00:03:01.430> battle<00:03:01.850> stringers<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.950> here's<00:03:04.160> a

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
ideas from battle stringers so here's a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.970 
ideas from battle stringers so here's a
closer<00:03:04.519> look<00:03:04.819> at<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.450> launcher<00:03:05.750> setup<00:03:06.140> from

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
closer look at the launcher setup from

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.100 
closer look at the launcher setup from
what<00:03:07.130> we've<00:03:07.310> seen<00:03:07.519> so<00:03:07.760> far<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.450> looks<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
what we've seen so far it looks like the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.509 
what we've seen so far it looks like the
launcher<00:03:09.410> grip<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:09.769> only<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.220> to

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
launcher grip it's only in there to

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.430 
launcher grip it's only in there to
cradle<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.090> top<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.510> release<00:03:11.930> it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
cradle the top and release it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.110 
cradle the top and release it
the<00:03:12.680> topic<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.459> launcher<00:03:13.880> itself<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.910> next

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the topic is the launcher itself so next

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.660 
the topic is the launcher itself so next
up<00:03:17.329> here<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.720> some<00:03:18.230> actual<00:03:18.680> gameplay<00:03:18.890> footage

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.580 

like<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.790> said<00:03:23.000> before<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.690> wire<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.200> inserted

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
like I said before the wire is inserted

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.830 
like I said before the wire is inserted
to<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.010> garo<00:03:25.459> engine<00:03:25.910> thing<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.600> top<00:03:26.810> is

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
to the garo engine thing and the top is

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.690 
to the garo engine thing and the top is
left<00:03:27.200> spinning<00:03:27.350> on<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.829> grip<00:03:28.160> then<00:03:28.340> shook<00:03:28.579> it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
left spinning on the grip then shook it

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.430 
left spinning on the grip then shook it
off<00:03:28.850> onto<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.269> scene<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:30.049> as<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.290> can

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
off onto the scene you so as you can

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.530 
off onto the scene you so as you can
tell<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.859> two<00:03:31.010> guys<00:03:31.190> playing<00:03:31.579> also<00:03:32.180> use<00:03:32.359> that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
tell the two guys playing also use that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.199 
tell the two guys playing also use that
spring<00:03:33.079> mechanism<00:03:33.260> thing<00:03:33.859> to<00:03:34.489> shoot<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.970> top

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
spring mechanism thing to shoot the top

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.789 
spring mechanism thing to shoot the top
against<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.870> other<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:37.579> then<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.090> battle<00:03:38.540> it

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
against the other so then it battle it

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:39.940 
against the other so then it battle it
fights

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
fights

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.490
