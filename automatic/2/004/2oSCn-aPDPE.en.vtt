00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
radio jst and this is a piece that I've

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.870 
radio jst and this is a piece that I've
owned<00:00:18.720> two<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.609> set

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
owned two of and I get a lot of you set

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.359 
owned two of and I get a lot of you set
with<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.779> studio<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.680> basically<00:00:23.250> what

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
with these in studio and basically what

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.880 
with these in studio and basically what
this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> microphone<00:00:24.420> splitter<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.650> has

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
this is as a microphone splitter it has

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.380 
this is as a microphone splitter it has
a<00:00:26.160> mic<00:00:26.580> input<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:29.070> also<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> pad<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
a mic input and it also has a pad on the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.220 
a mic input and it also has a pad on the
mic<00:00:30.570> input<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.830> has<00:00:32.009> three<00:00:32.880> outputs<00:00:33.660> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
mic input and it has three outputs have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.709 
mic input and it has three outputs have
an<00:00:34.350> isolated<00:00:34.590> output<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:36.360> direct

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
an isolated output and two direct

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.229 
an isolated output and two direct
outputs<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.550> there<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.730> ground<00:00:39.120> lifts<00:00:39.660> on

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
outputs and there are ground lifts on

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.010 
outputs and there are ground lifts on
the<00:00:42.239> isolated<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.399> second<00:00:45.020> through

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the isolated and the second through

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
the isolated and the second through
output<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.039> basically<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> for

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
output so basically what I use this for

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.750 
output so basically what I use this for
is<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.379> microphone<00:00:49.860> input<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> send

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is to take one microphone input and send

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
is to take one microphone input and send
it<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.149> sources<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> therefore<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it to two sources so therefore if you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600 
it to two sources so therefore if you
were<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> live<00:00:54.469> situation<00:00:55.469> where<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> band<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
were in a live situation where a band is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
were in a live situation where a band is
playing<00:00:56.879> live<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.320> want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.829> send<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
playing live and you want to send a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
playing live and you want to send a
microphone<00:01:00.510> signal<00:01:00.960> into<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> mixing<00:01:02.370> board

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
microphone signal into the mixing board

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.179 
microphone signal into the mixing board
for<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> PA<00:01:02.910> system<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:04.530> separate<00:01:04.979> signal

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
for the PA system and a separate signal

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.920 
for the PA system and a separate signal
into<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.880> interface<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.810> can

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
into your interface so that you can

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.560 
into your interface so that you can
record<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.150> for

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
record and then this is really good for

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
record and then this is really good for
that<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.470> course<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.220> wanted<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> take

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that now of course if you wanted to take

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
that now of course if you wanted to take
multiple<00:01:12.450> ones<00:01:12.659> you'd<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> buy<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
multiple ones you'd have to buy a lot of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.020 
multiple ones you'd have to buy a lot of
these<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> certain<00:01:14.460> point<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.939> would

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
these and at a certain point it would

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.109 
these and at a certain point it would
get<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.420> expensive<00:01:15.830> but<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> times

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
get kind of expensive but a lot of times

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640 
get kind of expensive but a lot of times
with<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> lead<00:01:18.689> vocal<00:01:19.080> mic<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.439> something

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
with just a lead vocal mic or something

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
with just a lead vocal mic or something
like<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> PA

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
like that it's going to go to the PA

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.080 
like that it's going to go to the PA
system<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:22.619> definitely<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> split<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
system you definitely need to split that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
system you definitely need to split that
if<00:01:24.360> you're<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> discrete<00:01:26.040> signal

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
if you're going to get a discrete signal

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
if you're going to get a discrete signal
from<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> vocal<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.020> use

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
from the vocal now what I actually use

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.039 
from the vocal now what I actually use
this<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> studio<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.210> one

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this for in the studio is to take one

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.350 
this for in the studio is to take one
microphone<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.950> send<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> two<00:01:32.939> separate

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
microphone and send it to two separate

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
microphone and send it to two separate
signal<00:01:33.720> paths<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.619> say<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.220> recording<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
signal paths so say if I'm recording a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.140 
signal paths so say if I'm recording a
singer<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.770> clean<00:01:38.430> less

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
singer and I want to have a clean less

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300 
singer and I want to have a clean less
compressed<00:01:39.630> signal<00:01:40.049> through<00:01:40.530> say<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
compressed signal through say a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
compressed signal through say a
chameleon<00:01:42.030> mic<00:01:42.240> preamp<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:42.990> something<00:01:43.530> like

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
chameleon mic preamp or something like

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
chameleon mic preamp or something like
that<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.460> run<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> microphone<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that I can run the microphone into the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
that I can run the microphone into the
Box<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> box<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> chameleon

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
Box out of the box into the chameleon

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
Box out of the box into the chameleon
preamp<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> compressor<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.100> then

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
preamp then into a compressor and then

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
preamp then into a compressor and then
into<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.729> analog<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.270> digital<00:01:51.299> converter<00:01:51.899> wow

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
into my analog to digital converter wow

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.840 
into my analog to digital converter wow
I<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:53.009> take<00:01:53.220> another<00:01:54.090> output<00:01:54.530> from<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.460> mic

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I can take another output from the mic

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.730 
I can take another output from the mic
splitter<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> run<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:57.930> say<00:01:58.140> maybe<00:01:58.530> add

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
splitter and run it into say maybe add

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.490 
splitter and run it into say maybe add
acheing<00:01:59.130> preamp<00:01:59.579> or<00:01:59.729> something<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
acheing preamp or something like that

lot of digital processing and another

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.550 
lot of digital processing and another
thing<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.060> find<00:02:44.390> out<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:44.990> a<00:02:45.050> lot<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.380> times

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
thing that I find out is a lot of times

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.930 
thing that I find out is a lot of times
I<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> distortion<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.820> get

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I like the distortion that I can get

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.420 
I like the distortion that I can get
from<00:02:47.090> my<00:02:47.210> mic<00:02:47.450> preamps<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.140> lot<00:02:48.560> better<00:02:48.830> than

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
from my mic preamps a lot better than

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.830 
from my mic preamps a lot better than
say<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.380> generic<00:02:52.390> plugin<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.570> might

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
say just a generic plugin that you might

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.530 
say just a generic plugin that you might
use<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.830> I'll<00:02:54.950> use<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> lot<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:55.850> tracking

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
use so I'll use this a lot for tracking

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.390 
use so I'll use this a lot for tracking
vocals<00:02:56.720> same<00:02:57.620> thing<00:02:57.830> could<00:02:57.950> be<00:02:58.010> said<00:02:58.160> for

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
mic input to two different preamps and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.720 
mic input to two different preamps and
you<00:03:18.080> could<00:03:18.230> actually<00:03:18.350> print<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:19.280> sound<00:03:19.550> from

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
you could actually print the sound from

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.430 
you could actually print the sound from
two<00:03:19.970> different<00:03:20.180> preamps<00:03:20.750> rather<00:03:21.020> than<00:03:21.170> having

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
two different preamps rather than having

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.950 
two different preamps rather than having
two<00:03:21.590> different<00:03:21.740> microphones<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.420> sound<00:03:23.780> so

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
two different microphones on a sound so

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.690 
two different microphones on a sound so
I<00:03:23.990> found<00:03:24.290> that's<00:03:24.410> very<00:03:24.650> useful<00:03:24.830> also<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.460> kick

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
I found that's very useful also on kick

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.330 
I found that's very useful also on kick
drum<00:03:26.030> very<00:03:27.020> often<00:03:27.440> what<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.620> would<00:03:28.070> do<00:03:28.190> with

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
drum very often what I would do with

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.840 
drum very often what I would do with
this<00:03:28.520> as<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:29.360> will<00:03:29.570> use<00:03:29.990> my<00:03:30.470> kick<00:03:30.740> mic<00:03:30.980> send<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
this as I will use my kick mic send the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.690 
this as I will use my kick mic send the
kick<00:03:32.030> mic<00:03:32.270> into<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.230> then<00:03:34.010> out<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.490> I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
kick mic into this then out of this I

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.330 
kick mic into this then out of this I
will<00:03:34.970> go<00:03:35.150> into<00:03:35.390> two<00:03:35.690> separate<00:03:36.140> preamps<00:03:36.650> when<00:03:37.310> I

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
will go into two separate preamps when I

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.420 
will go into two separate preamps when I
might<00:03:37.640> go<00:03:38.360> for<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.630> more<00:03:38.930> mid-range<00:03:39.650> e-flat

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
might go for a more mid-range e-flat

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.180 
might go for a more mid-range e-flat

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
sound on the kick drums the other I

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.190 
sound on the kick drums the other I
might<00:03:43.520> run<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.820> different<00:03:44.270> preamp<00:03:44.690> that's

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
might run to a different preamp that's

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.750 
might run to a different preamp that's
got<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> different<00:03:45.440> sort<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.010> tonality<00:03:46.370> and

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
got a different sort of tonality and

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.390 
got a different sort of tonality and
then<00:03:47.330> when<00:03:47.630> I'm<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:48.530> course<00:03:48.650> mixing<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> kick

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
then when I'm of course mixing the kick

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.890 
then when I'm of course mixing the kick
drum<00:03:49.640> I<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.850> it<00:03:49.970> on<00:03:50.060> two<00:03:50.270> different<00:03:50.420> faders

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
drum I have it on two different faders

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.160 
drum I have it on two different faders
so<00:03:51.560> then<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:52.010> can<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.910> know<00:03:53.060> put<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.600> compressor

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
so then I can you know put a compressor

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.430 
so then I can you know put a compressor
and<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.380> plug-in<00:03:54.890> on<00:03:55.190> both<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.320> set<00:03:57.320> these

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
and a plug-in on both and set these

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.350 
and a plug-in on both and set these
things<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.950> mix<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.340> Alan<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.940> I<00:03:59.120> found

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
things in the mix to Alan and I found

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.430 
things in the mix to Alan and I found
that<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> be<00:03:59.600> very<00:03:59.660> very<00:04:00.530> useful<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:03.200> be

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
that to be very very useful to to be

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.110 
that to be very very useful to to be
able<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.650> have<00:04:03.830> two<00:04:04.220> different<00:04:04.370> kick<00:04:04.730> sounds

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
able to have two different kick sounds

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.090 
able to have two different kick sounds
and<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.570> have<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.720> lot<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:05.959> preamps<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.680> lot<00:04:07.010> of

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
and I have a lot of preamps a lot of

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.040 
and I have a lot of preamps a lot of
time<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.310> might<00:04:07.640> not<00:04:07.670> be<00:04:08.120> sure<00:04:08.270> which<00:04:08.510> preamp<00:04:08.959> I

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
time I might not be sure which preamp I

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.230 
time I might not be sure which preamp I
want<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.380> use<00:04:09.530> use<00:04:10.010> them<00:04:10.190> kick<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.910> in<00:04:11.150> this

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
want to use use them kick so in this

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.440 
want to use use them kick so in this
case<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.900> use<00:04:12.230> either<00:04:12.980> or<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.790> combination

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
case I can use either or a combination

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.120 
case I can use either or a combination
of<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.630> two<00:04:14.780> again<00:04:15.350> when<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.590> record<00:04:15.980> these

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
of the two again when you record these

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.740 
of the two again when you record these
together<00:04:16.370> they're<00:04:17.000> going<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.239> be<00:04:17.299> perfectly

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
together they're going to be perfectly

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.380 
together they're going to be perfectly
in<00:04:17.840> phase<00:04:18.580> so<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.609> don't<00:04:19.880> have<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.209> worry

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
in phase so you don't have to worry

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.690 
in phase so you don't have to worry
about<00:04:20.450> phase<00:04:20.959> cancellation<00:04:21.370> like<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.520> would

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
about phase cancellation like you would

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.219 
about phase cancellation like you would
say<00:04:22.940> if<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.120> use<00:04:23.300> two<00:04:23.540> microphones

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
say if you use two microphones

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.110 
say if you use two microphones
well<00:04:24.710> we've<00:04:24.830> used<00:04:25.070> two<00:04:25.400> microphones<00:04:25.880> in<00:04:26.030> the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
well we've used two microphones in the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.860 
well we've used two microphones in the
kick<00:04:26.300> drum<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.720> diaphragms<00:04:27.440> have<00:04:27.650> two

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
kick drum the diaphragms have two

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.650 
kick drum the diaphragms have two
be<00:04:27.979> exactly<00:04:28.979> together<00:04:29.610> think<00:04:30.330> if<00:04:30.449> one's

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
be exactly together think if one's

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.969 
be exactly together think if one's
behind<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> other<00:04:31.229> one<00:04:31.410> will<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.770> one

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
behind the other one will that one

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.110 
behind the other one will that one
they're<00:04:32.280> going<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.550> out<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.699> phase<00:04:32.940> from

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
they're going to be out of phase from

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.460 
they're going to be out of phase from
each<00:04:33.300> other<00:04:33.479> when<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:33.960> start<00:04:34.290> combining

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
each other when you start combining

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.230 
each other when you start combining
these<00:04:34.889> two<00:04:35.070> kick<00:04:35.310> drum<00:04:35.520> signals<00:04:35.970> together

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
these two kick drum signals together

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909 
these two kick drum signals together
you're<00:04:36.780> going<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> get<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.139> phase<00:04:37.620> cancellation

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
you're going to get a phase cancellation

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.060 
you're going to get a phase cancellation
and<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:38.970> going<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.750> know<00:04:39.949> damage<00:04:40.949> your

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
and it's going to you know damage your

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.189 
and it's going to you know damage your
kick<00:04:41.220> drum<00:04:41.490> sound<00:04:41.699> same<00:04:42.060> with<00:04:42.210> vocals<00:04:42.570> same

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
kick drum sound same with vocals same

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.730 
kick drum sound same with vocals same
with<00:04:43.350> guitar<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:45.000> if<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.900> want<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.199> take<00:04:46.410> two

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
with guitar so if you want to take two

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.159 
with guitar so if you want to take two
microphone<00:04:47.280> inputs<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:47.940> send<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:48.930> two

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
microphone inputs and send it to two

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.800 
microphone inputs and send it to two
different<00:04:49.470> places<00:04:49.650> for<00:04:50.010> whatever<00:04:50.220> reason<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
different places for whatever reason the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.580 
different places for whatever reason the
radio<00:04:52.229> js2<00:04:53.100> is<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> great<00:04:53.910> piece<00:04:54.210> of<00:04:54.240> gear<00:04:54.600> yes<00:04:55.380> I
