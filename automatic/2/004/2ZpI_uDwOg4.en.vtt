all<00:00:01.770> right<00:00:01.979> let's<00:00:02.190> take<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.399> look<00:00:02.490> at<00:00:02.730> the

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
all right let's take a look at the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.419 
all right let's take a look at the
microphone<00:00:03.300> demo<00:00:03.629> LabVIEW<00:00:04.440> project<00:00:07.400> here<00:00:08.400> I

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
microphone demo LabVIEW project here I

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.450 
microphone demo LabVIEW project here I
have<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.820> ADM<00:00:09.240> p50<00:00:10.230> for<00:00:10.590> microphone<00:00:11.250> I'm

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
have the ADM p50 for microphone I'm

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.759 
have the ADM p50 for microphone I'm
amplifying<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.750> microphone<00:00:13.170> signal<00:00:13.650> and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
amplifying the microphone signal and

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.760 
amplifying the microphone signal and
passing<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> analog<00:00:15.750> input<00:00:16.199> 0<00:00:16.470> on

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
passing that to the analog input 0 on

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.279 
passing that to the analog input 0 on
connector<00:00:17.400> B<00:00:17.660> here<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:18.779> looking<00:00:19.109> at<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
connector B here I'm looking at the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.620 
connector B here I'm looking at the
signal<00:00:19.650> coming<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> microphone<00:00:20.699> at

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
signal coming out of the microphone at

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
signal coming out of the microphone at
the<00:00:21.840> moment<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.410> looking<00:00:22.439> at<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> audio

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the moment I'm looking at the audio

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.019 
the moment I'm looking at the audio
input<00:00:23.760> left<00:00:24.180> channel<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.400> select<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:26.939> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
input left channel you can select any of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
input left channel you can select any of
the<00:00:27.180> available<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.869> log<00:00:28.109> inputs<00:00:28.529> here<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the available and log inputs here but I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.380 
the available and log inputs here but I
need<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> point<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
need to point out that you have to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840 
need to point out that you have to
restart<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> VI<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.430> selection

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
restart the VI because that selection

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.250 
restart the VI because that selection
happens<00:00:33.420> before<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.079> timed<00:00:34.320> loop<00:00:34.590> begins

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
happens before the timed loop begins

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.020 
happens before the timed loop begins
alright<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.559> looking<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.520> analog

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
alright now I'm looking at the analog

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.709 
alright now I'm looking at the analog
input<00:00:39.480> 0<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> B<00:00:40.200> connector<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
input 0 on the B connector this has a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.139 
input 0 on the B connector this has a
range<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.230> 0<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.590> 5<00:00:43.950> volts<00:00:43.980> I'll<00:00:44.520> change<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
range of 0 to 5 volts I'll change the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.080 
range of 0 to 5 volts I'll change the
range<00:00:45.710> accordingly<00:00:46.710> make<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.000> of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
range accordingly make a little bit of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
range accordingly make a little bit of
noise<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> microphone

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
noise on the microphone

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.369 
noise on the microphone
you<00:00:50.370> won't<00:00:50.550> hear<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> actual<00:00:51.600> sound<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you won't hear the actual sound but you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.930 
you won't hear the actual sound but you
can<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> registering<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> waveform

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
can see it registering on the waveform

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.510 
can see it registering on the waveform
there<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> based<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> timed

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
there and this is based on the timed

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.529 
there and this is based on the timed
loop<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:58.170> timed<00:00:58.500> loop<00:00:58.770> gives<00:00:59.670> us<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.059> precise

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
loop this timed loop gives us a precise

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.380 
loop this timed loop gives us a precise
way<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.870> sampling<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.010> microphone<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:03.359> now

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
way of sampling the microphone right now

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
way of sampling the microphone right now
I'm<00:01:03.660> doing<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.500> 10<00:01:04.920> kilohertz<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I'm doing so at 10 kilohertz this is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
I'm doing so at 10 kilohertz this is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
based on the read VI this is a low level

based on the read VI this is a low level

sub VI in the my REO sub palette I pull

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.149 
sub VI in the my REO sub palette I pull
off<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.330> individual<00:01:16.110> sample<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> then

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
off the individual sample and then

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.149 
off the individual sample and then
connect<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.060> waveform<00:01:18.299> chart<00:01:19.159> the

history you can do that with a chart
history<00:01:55.200> length<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:57.140> let's<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.350> run<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
history length here let's just run this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.250 
history length here let's just run this
real<00:01:59.009> quick

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.740 

here<00:02:06.260> I'm<00:02:06.410> making<00:02:06.650> some<00:02:07.250> noise<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.880> stopped<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
here I'm making some noise I stopped the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.350 
here I'm making some noise I stopped the
vi<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:09.289> at<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> point<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.310> interest<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.270> I

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
vi on at a point of interest and then I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.560 
vi on at a point of interest and then I
can<00:02:11.540> use<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.900> graph<00:02:12.140> tools<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.830> zoom<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.340> on
