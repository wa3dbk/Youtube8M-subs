so if i move cellular data below Wi-Fi

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.800 
so if i move cellular data below Wi-Fi
now<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.280> i<00:03:04.370> go<00:03:04.520> here<00:03:04.550> you'll<00:03:05.330> see<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.600> Wi-Fi

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and then cellular data we can switch

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.930 
and then cellular data we can switch
that<00:03:08.810> back<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.380> then<00:03:10.160> switch<00:03:10.490> back<00:03:10.520> right

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that back and then switch back right

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.240 
that back and then switch back right
