80 hundred yards something like that

80 hundred yards something like that
that's<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.850> prefer<00:02:00.240> bring<00:02:00.990> a

that's what we really prefer bring a

spotting scope binoculars those kinds of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.899 
spotting scope binoculars those kinds of
things<00:02:03.530> one<00:02:04.530> thing<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.399> discourage

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
things one thing we really do discourage

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.210 
things one thing we really do discourage
is<00:02:06.090> folks<00:02:06.360> setting<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.990> blind<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
is folks setting up a blind like a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
is folks setting up a blind like a
photography<00:02:08.970> blind<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> lek<00:02:09.869> or

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
photography blind on the lek or

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
photography blind on the lek or
something<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.640> what<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
something like that but is what can be a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.710 
something like that but is what can be a
lot<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:12.720> sensitive<00:02:13.080> or<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.349> hand

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
lot more sensitive or the hand

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.020 
lot more sensitive or the hand
and<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.710> if<00:02:15.040> there's<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.400> lot<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.670> human

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and so if there's a lot of human

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.880 
and so if there's a lot of human
presence<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.840> around<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.230> lack<00:02:17.470> during<00:02:17.800> the
