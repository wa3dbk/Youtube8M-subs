got to be a little bit careful but

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.650 
got to be a little bit careful but
there's<00:01:03.199> always<00:01:03.500> room<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:04.520> step<00:01:04.850> back<00:01:05.119> through

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.139 
a double turn and just get the hell out
of<00:01:08.119> there<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:09.080> it's<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:10.070> great<00:01:10.520> simple

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
of there it's it's a great simple

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.839 
of there it's it's a great simple
strategy<00:01:11.959> that<00:01:12.500> I'm<00:01:12.800> gonna<00:01:13.009> do<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.280> high<00:01:13.610> round

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:13.849 
strategy that I'm gonna do a high round

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:15.730 
strategy that I'm gonna do a high round
stream<00:01:14.270> two<00:01:14.539> players<00:01:14.840> I<00:01:15.110> think<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.500> my

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
stream two players I think with my

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.620 
stream two players I think with my
friend<00:01:16.160> right<00:01:16.819> when<00:01:16.970> i<00:01:17.030> get<00:01:17.179> back<00:01:17.300> from<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
friend right when i get back from the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.059 
friend right when i get back from the
doctor<00:01:18.050> which<00:01:18.289> I<00:01:18.500> don't<00:01:18.560> know<00:01:18.770> when<00:01:18.920> this

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
doctor which I don't know when this

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:20.680 
doctor which I don't know when this
video<00:01:19.340> will<00:01:19.490> be<00:01:19.610> going<00:01:19.849> up<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.149> that's<00:01:20.270> when

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
video will be going up but that's when

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.650 
video will be going up but that's when
maybe<00:01:21.619> they'll<00:01:21.890> be<00:01:22.160> live<00:01:22.399> then<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.119> just<00:01:23.450> make

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
maybe they'll be live then so just make

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.999 
maybe they'll be live then so just make
sure<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.840> check<00:01:24.050> your<00:01:24.170> sub<00:01:24.380> feed<00:01:24.590> I'm<00:01:24.740> gonna<00:01:24.890> be

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
sure to check your sub feed I'm gonna be

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.440 
sure to check your sub feed I'm gonna be
going<00:01:25.099> for<00:01:25.369> some<00:01:25.490> high<00:01:25.640> rounds<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.360> know

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
going for some high rounds you know

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.050 
going for some high rounds you know
50-plus<00:01:27.110> hopefully<00:01:27.709> that's<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:28.520> plan<00:01:28.789> for

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
50-plus hopefully that's the plan for

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.699 
50-plus hopefully that's the plan for
today<00:01:29.179> but<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:29.929> is<00:01:30.080> just<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.289> really<00:01:30.440> simple

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
today but this is just a really simple

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
today but this is just a really simple
strategy<00:01:31.069> you<00:01:31.130> can<00:01:31.160> do<00:01:31.310> this<00:01:31.429> on<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.700> other

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
strategy you can do this on the other

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.029 
strategy you can do this on the other
side<00:01:32.270> too<00:01:32.569> however<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.709> easiest

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
side too however this is the easiest

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.999 
side too however this is the easiest
side<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.240> other<00:01:35.270> side<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.229> spawn<00:01:36.679> room

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
side the other side of this spawn room

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.540 
side the other side of this spawn room
does<00:01:37.459> work<00:01:37.819> very<00:01:38.090> efficiently<00:01:39.190> but<00:01:40.190> this<00:01:40.369> is

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
does work very efficiently but this is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.059 
does work very efficiently but this is
just<00:01:40.580> my<00:01:40.880> favorite<00:01:40.910> right<00:01:41.539> here<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.920> this

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
just my favorite right here and and this

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.979 
just my favorite right here and and this
big<00:01:43.340> guy<00:01:43.489> does<00:01:43.729> take<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:43.970> little<00:01:44.119> bit<00:01:44.270> time<00:01:44.660> to

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:44.989 
big guy does take a little bit time to

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.320 
big guy does take a little bit time to
kill<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:45.679> you<00:01:46.009> know<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.550> can<00:01:46.729> take<00:01:46.910> them<00:01:47.090> it's

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
kill but you know you can take them it's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.449 
kill but you know you can take them it's
