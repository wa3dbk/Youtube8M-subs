now<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.490> about<00:01:37.119> eight<00:01:37.390> hundred<00:01:37.569> bucks<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:38.079> month

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
now is about eight hundred bucks a month

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.469

a<00:02:02.530> lot<00:02:02.709> I<00:02:03.009> we<00:02:03.490> have<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> thousand<00:02:04.270> square<00:02:04.539> foot

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
a lot I we have a thousand square foot

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.599 
a lot I we have a thousand square foot
place<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.259> don't<00:02:05.530> think<00:02:05.979> that's<00:02:06.159> really<00:02:06.369> big

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
place I don't think that's really big

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:07.800 
place I don't think that's really big
enough<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.939> would<00:02:06.999> love<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.420> have<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.569> bigger

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
enough I would love to have a bigger

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.779 
enough I would love to have a bigger
place<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.319> if<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.800> had<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.100> start<00:02:09.280> over<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.550> would

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
place and if I had to start over I would

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.220 
place and if I had to start over I would
have<00:02:09.819> gotten<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.360> bigger<00:02:10.509> place<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.990> we<00:02:11.050> may

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
have gotten a bigger place and we may

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.260 
have gotten a bigger place and we may
move<00:02:11.470> up<00:02:11.680> eventually<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.340> if<00:02:13.000> you're<00:02:13.150> gonna

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
move up eventually so if you're gonna

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.150 
move up eventually so if you're gonna
try<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.319> do<00:02:14.410> something<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.890> I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
try and do something like this I

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.560 
try and do something like this I
definitely<00:02:15.580> recommend<00:02:15.850> getting<00:02:16.120> more<00:02:16.330> space

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
definitely recommend getting more space

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.450 
definitely recommend getting more space
because<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:17.830> much<00:02:18.040> stuff<00:02:18.340> we

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
because we just have so much stuff we

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.890 
because we just have so much stuff we
have<00:02:18.490> an<00:02:18.610> off-site<00:02:18.970> facility

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
have an off-site facility

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.270 
have an off-site facility
it's<00:02:20.019> even<00:02:20.170> bigger<00:02:20.290> than<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.680> store<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.099> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
it's even bigger than the store just to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.380 
it's even bigger than the store just to
store<00:02:21.519> everything<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.180> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
store everything but it's just a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.589 
store everything but it's just a
warehouse<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.939> also<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.450> pay

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
warehouse and that you also have to pay

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.350 
warehouse and that you also have to pay
for<00:02:25.659> it<00:02:25.870> too<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.530> storage<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.360> rent

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
for it too so the the storage and rent

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.179 
for it too so the the storage and rent
whether<00:02:28.959> it's<00:02:29.170> all<00:02:29.319> in<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.590> place<00:02:29.739> or<00:02:30.069> whether

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
whether it's all in one place or whether

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.530 
whether it's all in one place or whether
it's<00:02:30.370> separate<00:02:30.700> that's<00:02:31.030> gonna<00:02:31.209> be<00:02:31.390> your

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
it's separate that's gonna be your

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.929 
it's separate that's gonna be your
biggest<00:02:31.720> cost<00:02:32.049> so<00:02:32.349> figuring<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.099> out<00:02:33.159> will

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
biggest cost so figuring that out will

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.580 
biggest cost so figuring that out will
help<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.569> get<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> general<00:02:35.170> idea<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.470> where

and we have started to ramping up but
it's<00:02:53.500> definitely<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.950> get<00:02:54.040> expensive<00:02:54.400> like<00:02:55.269> I

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
it's definitely can get expensive like I

you guys an idea general idea if you

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.379 
you guys an idea general idea if you

couldn't find that information anywhere

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.020 
couldn't find that information anywhere
else<00:04:04.569> at<00:04:05.049> least<00:04:05.319> a<00:04:05.470> ballpark<00:04:05.919> it<00:04:06.159> but<00:04:06.639> like<00:04:06.909> I

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
else at least a ballpark it but like I

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.479 
else at least a ballpark it but like I
said<00:04:07.090> focus<00:04:07.750> on<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> rent<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.440> how<00:04:09.220> much<00:04:09.370> it

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
said focus on the rent and how much it

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.830 
said focus on the rent and how much it
will<00:04:09.549> cost<00:04:09.699> you<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.909> get<00:04:10.060> your<00:04:10.209> stuff<00:04:10.510> because

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
will cost you to get your stuff because

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.270 
will cost you to get your stuff because
those<00:04:11.019> will<00:04:11.229> be<00:04:11.319> your<00:04:11.500> biggest<00:04:11.680> costs

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
those will be your biggest costs

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.680

everything<00:04:12.729> else<00:04:12.879> you<00:04:13.030> can<00:04:13.150> kind<00:04:13.389> of<00:04:13.449> try<00:04:13.599> and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
everything else you can kind of try and

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.809 
everything else you can kind of try and
mitigate<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.169> keep<00:04:14.319> low<00:04:14.560> but<00:04:15.370> if<00:04:15.609> you're<00:04:15.729> in

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
mitigate and keep low but if you're in

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.580 
mitigate and keep low but if you're in
an<00:04:15.909> expensive<00:04:16.449> rent<00:04:16.659> area<00:04:16.959> that's<00:04:17.260> gonna<00:04:17.409> be

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
an expensive rent area that's gonna be

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.199 
an expensive rent area that's gonna be
your<00:04:17.709> most<00:04:17.859> expensive<00:04:18.130> cost<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.970> it's

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
your most expensive cost and it's

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.819 
your most expensive cost and it's
probably<00:04:19.359> gonna<00:04:19.539> be<00:04:19.630> pretty<00:04:19.840> high<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.560> just

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
probably gonna be pretty high so just

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.100 
probably gonna be pretty high so just
keep<00:04:20.979> an<00:04:21.130> eye<00:04:21.220> out<00:04:21.250> for<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:22.330> big<00:04:22.539> cost<00:04:22.750> like

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
keep an eye out for the big cost like

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.510 
keep an eye out for the big cost like
that<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.530> if<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.650> guys<00:04:23.770> have<00:04:23.949> any<00:04:24.070> specific
