 long live the wind and live the wind turbines

 mulhouse a company comes from 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.700
 get a contract to achieve in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.340
 the department of pas de calais one of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.719
 three major wind farms europe and the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.910
 most important of France 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.590
 a renewable energy technique that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 will delight the environmentalists patrick esther 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.210
 the sun by heating the atmosphere 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.470
 created the clouds but also the winds 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.300
 today technology allows for 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.410
 capture a significant part of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 this energy constantly renewed 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.469
 Germany Denmark Spain Resort 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 already largely to 5432 wind turbines 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.790
 megawatts are produced across the Rhine 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 every year thanks to the wind which 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 represents the equivalent of five 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.370
 nuclear reactors 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.320
 France is far behind with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 only 69 megawatts 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.949
 but within two years in the no 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 calais taking advantage of blowing winds 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 from the sleeve a vast park more 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 100 lienne tea will be built in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 fruges and the twelve communes 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.480
 surrounding 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.000
 the be and wind park of fruges consists 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.150
 to install 117 machine for a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 power of 150 megawatts then 150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.110
 megawatts roughly corresponds to a hundred 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.159
 a thousand homes with electricity 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.470
 the company that won the contract 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.290
 realization of this park has already 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.729
 builds 200 wind turbines in germany 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 two days are enough to assemble the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.869
 machine once built the concrete pad 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 armed with more than 300 tons 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.579
 but before any implementation a study 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.920
 careful consideration must be given to choose 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.329
 wind turbine models adapted to the site at 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.759
 the power and the direction of the winds 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.860
 especially it is also about taking 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.740
 account the respect of the environment 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.830
 these 117 wind turbines will be distributed in 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.940
 13 municipalities and on a diameter of 15 to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.950
 20 km then visually in one place 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.440
 well defined its highest on fruits I 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.050
 go out to nag years we will see at most ten 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.130
 papus wind turbines to respect its 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.650
 European commitments 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.350
 in 2010 France should be able 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.490
 to produce 14 thousand megawatts thanks to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.070
 renewable energies 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.970
 wind turbine manufacturers still have 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.970
 beautiful days before them
