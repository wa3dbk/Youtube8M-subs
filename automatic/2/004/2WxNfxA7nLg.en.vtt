00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.990 

we<00:00:17.960> have<00:00:18.170> stabilized<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.040> acrylic<00:00:19.430> resin<00:00:19.850> and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
we have stabilized the acrylic resin and

look at the retromolar pad region you

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.490 
look at the retromolar pad region you
will<00:04:36.919> notice<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:37.640> have<00:04:37.669> marked

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
will notice that we have marked

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.370 
will notice that we have marked
these<00:04:38.650> two<00:04:38.920> pads<00:04:39.220> by<00:04:39.610> laterally<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:40.630> we<00:04:41.290> are

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
these two pads by laterally and we are

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.410 
these two pads by laterally and we are
going<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> extend<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.310> line<00:04:42.490> out<00:04:42.730> onto<00:04:43.330> the

retro<00:04:46.840> motor<00:04:47.050> Pyatt<00:04:49.140> now<00:04:50.140> if<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:50.650> position<00:04:50.860> the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
retro motor Pyatt now if we position the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.740 
retro motor Pyatt now if we position the
base<00:04:51.970> plate<00:04:52.330> over<00:04:53.170> this<00:04:54.240> residual<00:04:55.240> Ridge<00:04:55.450> and

base plate over this residual Ridge and
the<00:04:55.960> retromolar<00:04:56.290> pad<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:57.310> gives<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.790> some

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
the retromolar pad it gives you some

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.180 
the retromolar pad it gives you some
indication<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.230> relationship<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.100> the

indication of the relationship of the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.660 
indication of the relationship of the
height<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.420> occlusal<00:05:01.960> rim<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:03.400> pad

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
height of the occlusal rim to this pad

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.750 
height of the occlusal rim to this pad
now<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.450> will<00:05:04.690> notice<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.460> still

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
now you will notice that the it is still

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.990 
now you will notice that the it is still
too<00:05:07.120> high<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:07.780> we<00:05:08.440> find<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:08.920> if<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.220> use<00:05:09.670> the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
too high and we find that if you use the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120 
too high and we find that if you use the
red<00:05:10.270> devil<00:05:10.630> wax<00:05:10.870> spatula<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.680> heat<00:05:11.919> this

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
red devil wax spatula and heat this

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.230 
red devil wax spatula and heat this
uniformly<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:13.060> then<00:05:13.810> pass<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.560> over<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:15.240> wax

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
uniformly and then pass it over the wax
