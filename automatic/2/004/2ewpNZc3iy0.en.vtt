affair and I was completely clueless

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.550 
affair and I was completely clueless
until<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.730> stream<00:00:49.059> was<00:00:49.420> over<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.840> recording<00:00:50.500> of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
until the stream was over a recording of

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.290 
until the stream was over a recording of
the<00:00:50.710> stream<00:00:50.950> has<00:00:51.160> been<00:00:51.370> promised<00:00:51.790> by<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:51.940> devs

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
the stream has been promised by the devs

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.090 
the stream has been promised by the devs
but<00:00:52.810> seeing<00:00:53.050> how<00:00:53.170> long<00:00:53.380> since<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.829> stream

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
but seeing how long since the stream

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.190 
but seeing how long since the stream
actually<00:00:54.610> happened<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.270> would<00:00:55.630> not<00:00:55.750> be<00:00:55.870> holding

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
actually happened I would not be holding

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.140 
actually happened I would not be holding
my<00:00:56.290> breath<00:00:56.320> for<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.770> recording<00:00:57.250> anytime<00:00:57.760> soon

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
my breath for the recording anytime soon

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.090 
my breath for the recording anytime soon
so<00:00:58.630> how<00:00:58.750> does<00:00:58.810> this<00:00:59.020> tie<00:00:59.290> into<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.620> countdown

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
so how does this tie into the countdown

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.310 
so how does this tie into the countdown
well<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:01.060> me<00:01:01.210> it<00:01:01.420> seems<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.840> disprove<00:01:02.290> what

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
well to me it seems to disprove what

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.530 
well to me it seems to disprove what
everybody<00:01:03.010> thinks<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:03.730> is<00:01:03.970> this<00:01:04.270> timer

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
everybody thinks and that is this timer

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.450 
everybody thinks and that is this timer
is<00:01:04.780> not<00:01:04.989> counting<00:01:05.440> down<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.950> release<00:01:06.250> of

for the full retail game the live stream

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.050 
for the full retail game the live stream
that<00:01:17.619> happened<00:01:17.950> demonstrating<00:01:18.490> multiplayer

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
that happened demonstrating multiplayer

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.420 
that happened demonstrating multiplayer
although<00:01:19.479> looking<00:01:19.840> nice<00:01:20.200> was<00:01:20.710> said<00:01:20.920> multiple

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
although looking nice was said multiple

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.789 
although looking nice was said multiple
times<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:22.000> be<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.360> work<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.930> progress

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
times to be a work in progress

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.620 
times to be a work in progress
so<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.220> whole<00:01:24.400> game<00:01:24.580> coming<00:01:24.940> out<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.090> few<00:01:25.450> weeks

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
so the whole game coming out a few weeks

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.510 
so the whole game coming out a few weeks
after<00:01:25.900> this<00:01:26.380> live<00:01:26.590> stream<00:01:26.890> happened<00:01:27.280> would<00:01:27.400> be

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
both the same this might be nitpicking

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.940 
both the same this might be nitpicking
or<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.450> might<00:02:04.720> be<00:02:04.750> completely<00:02:05.350> wrong<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.830> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
or I might be completely wrong and the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.289 
or I might be completely wrong and the
green<00:02:06.159> team<00:02:06.369> will<00:02:06.520> still<00:02:06.759> have<00:02:07.060> the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
green team will still have the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.990 
green team will still have the
resistance<00:02:07.630> style<00:02:08.290> view<00:02:08.739> models<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.790> just

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
resistance style view models but it just

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.759 
resistance style view models but it just
seems<00:02:10.239> like<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.750> multiplayer<00:02:11.080> itself

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
seems like that the multiplayer itself

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.560 
seems like that the multiplayer itself
still<00:02:12.130> has<00:02:12.370> things<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.880> need<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.150> be<00:02:13.180> worked

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
still has things that need to be worked

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.660 
still has things that need to be worked
on<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.230> think<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.739> countdown<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.459> is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
on what I think the countdown for is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.640 
on what I think the countdown for is
actually<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.269> lot<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.720> different<00:02:17.019> things<00:02:17.410> that

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
actually a lot of different things that

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.630 
actually a lot of different things that
will<00:02:17.739> happen<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:18.220> once

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
will happen at once

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.030 
will happen at once
first<00:02:19.239> we<00:02:19.690> will<00:02:19.840> probably<00:02:20.320> get<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> general

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
first we will probably get a general

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.860 
first we will probably get a general
release<00:02:21.280> schedule<00:02:21.700> for<00:02:21.880> black<00:02:22.060> mesas<00:02:22.540> full

steam<00:02:23.350> release<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.280> might<00:02:24.519> not<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.790> an<00:02:24.880> exact

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239

steam release it might not be an exact
date<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.140> probably<00:02:26.349> will<00:02:26.739> be<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.099> certain

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670

I feel like the Black Mesa devs might

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.900 
I feel like the Black Mesa devs might
start<00:02:53.260> taking<00:02:53.410> pre-orders<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> game<00:02:54.670> and

the Black Mesa multiplayer is something
that<00:03:04.060> they<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.330> thought<00:03:04.720> about<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.260> seeing

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.699 
multiplayer system is a great idea
and<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:16.030> wouldn't<00:03:16.300> want<00:03:16.480> everybody<00:03:17.320> having

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
and you wouldn't want everybody having

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.530 
and you wouldn't want everybody having
access<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.370> multiplayer<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.120> probably

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
access to the multiplayer so probably

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.150 
access to the multiplayer so probably
putting<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.959> behind<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.320> pre-order<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.950> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
putting it behind a pre-order is the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.190 
putting it behind a pre-order is the
best<00:03:21.400> bet<00:03:21.670> for<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.000> developers<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:22.900> you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
best bet for the developers but you

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.660 
best bet for the developers but you
should<00:03:23.470> remember<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.950> even<00:03:24.430> if<00:03:24.519> I'm

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
should remember that even if I'm

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.490 
should remember that even if I'm
completely<00:03:25.209> wrong<00:03:25.480> whatever<00:03:26.019> happens

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
completely wrong whatever happens

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.650 
completely wrong whatever happens
something<00:03:27.340> will<00:03:27.580> happen<00:03:27.850> at<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.180> end<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
something will happen at the end of the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.050 
something will happen at the end of the
timer<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.230> do<00:03:29.380> not<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.220> however<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
timer I do not think however that the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.479 
timer I do not think however that the
full<00:03:31.360> game<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.959> going<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.350> done<00:03:32.709> in<00:03:33.040> three

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
full game is going to be done in three

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.090 
full game is going to be done in three
days<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:34.600> game<00:03:34.750> is<00:03:35.080> just<00:03:35.440> one<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
days this game is just one of the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.979 
days this game is just one of the
greatest<00:03:36.489> examples<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:37.360> what<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.630> community

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
greatest examples of what a community

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.990 
greatest examples of what a community
can<00:03:38.500> do<00:03:38.739> when<00:03:39.010> they<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.280> passion<00:03:39.579> for<00:03:39.970> a

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
can do when they have passion for a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.140 
can do when they have passion for a
project<00:03:40.299> but<00:03:41.190> realistically<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.850> is<00:03:43.030> an

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
project but realistically this is an

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.000 
project but realistically this is an
enormous<00:03:43.600> undertaking<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.620> even<00:03:44.890> though

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
enormous undertaking and even though

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.009 
enormous undertaking and even though
it's<00:03:45.220> been<00:03:45.430> years<00:03:45.459> since<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.420> original<00:03:46.870> Black

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
it's been years since the original Black

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.199 
it's been years since the original Black
Mesa<00:03:47.260> trailer<00:03:47.890> there<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.459> still<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.910> lot<00:03:49.180> of

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
Mesa trailer there is still a lot of

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.180 
Mesa trailer there is still a lot of
things<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.959> developers<00:03:50.470> probably<00:03:51.010> need

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
things that the developers probably need

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.759 
things that the developers probably need
to<00:03:51.340> get<00:03:51.489> done<00:03:51.790> before<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.420> full<00:03:52.959> retail<00:03:53.470> game

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
to get done before a full retail game

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.370 
to get done before a full retail game
can<00:03:54.070> be<00:03:54.250> released<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:55.000> know<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:55.989> fact<00:03:56.049> that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
can be released I know for a fact that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.960 
can be released I know for a fact that
the<00:03:56.530> Black<00:03:56.709> Mesa<00:03:56.890> developers<00:03:57.489> want<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.850> make

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the Black Mesa developers want to make

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.180 
the Black Mesa developers want to make
sure<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.329> is<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.690> best<00:03:58.989> possible<00:03:59.560> game

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
sure this is the best possible game

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.780 
sure this is the best possible game
there<00:04:00.459> is

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
there is

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.600

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
and that means polishing it as much as

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.940 
and that means polishing it as much as
they<00:04:03.790> possibly<00:04:04.000> can<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.170> whatever<00:04:05.500> happens
