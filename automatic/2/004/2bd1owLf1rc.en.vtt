00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.710

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.030
 question of an imaginary surfer 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.840
 share all together and we will do 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.910
 discover plenty of games in preview 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.289

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.579

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.230
 we discover it is full of games 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.020
 balls and holes to tangier in front of the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 town hall to scramble it can be 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 possible to cancel them quad we will have to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.470
 do that at the big rex in paris 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.659
 I know it's not good it's the 6th 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.920
 september at the grand rex in paris and for 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.909
 reserve its place we imagine a system 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 extremely complex 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.110
 just click on the link in the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.520
 description it's terrible it was beautiful 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.900
 well I have another question from a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.580
 surfer I just invented 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.490

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 can not come to paris 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 how am I doing and I'm depressing and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.880
 I listen to zaz no, especially not 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 since we have thought of everything since the show 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 will be broadcast live live 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.950
 free on youtube 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.229
 so go on September 6th we have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 can not wait to see real goodbye to beaune 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.560
 you do not wait because in fact 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.080
 I'd just like to do this year 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 the world no 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.380
 one last energy this witness who says 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.000
 last thing for those who are surprised 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.520
 ticket price that starts at 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.690
 from 25 euros 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 unfortunately we have been trying to 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.810
 minimize ticket prices 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 we can not do this for free because 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.300
 that in fact there are many things that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.980
 are extremely expensive exactly the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.360
 room rental power goes 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.370
 to transmit without a live show of nothing 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 their team to pay and also 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.380
 lots of stuff the director is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.680
 a lot of stuff and it costs 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.870
 money 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.550
 we will have done well the price of the ticket to 0 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.229
 it was not possible it is not possible 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 so we do not win money 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.470
 it's just for fun 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.330
 was offering a show that's true 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.410
 could have done nothing and 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.780
 so suddenly there were no tickets 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.670
 it's nothing we like to do 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.470
 stuff and mostly down to see you and we are 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.610
 on something new that changes 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.840
 a little bit of the videos takes us out of 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 videos to see you and his dreams you 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.620
 offer a real choice and a good time 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.570
 it's a good time all together and we 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.190
 hope you would be here that you 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.750
 be in the room wherever you are 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.530
 on youtube to watch the live and then 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.570
 I hope you because simply 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.890
 as we are going to spend a beautiful no 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.120
 hopefully unless we see each other again 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.120
