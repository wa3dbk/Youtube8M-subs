not<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.890> know<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.250> default<00:03:02.550> controls

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.930 
not you know the default controls
dentists<00:03:03.239> foot<00:03:03.390> touch<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.840> i'm<00:03:04.320> using<00:03:04.940> an

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
dentists foot touch and i'm using an

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.760 
dentists foot touch and i'm using an
amazing<00:03:06.270> VIP<00:03:06.570> its<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.840> gets<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> little<00:03:07.440> bit<00:03:07.620> too

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
amazing VIP its it gets a little bit too

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.960 
amazing VIP its it gets a little bit too
easy<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:08.340> i<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.760> should<00:03:08.880> be<00:03:08.910> a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
easy but now i think it should be a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.090 
easy but now i think it should be a
challenge<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.600> I'm<00:03:10.440> probably<00:03:10.560> gonna<00:03:10.770> regret

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
challenge and I'm probably gonna regret

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.350 
challenge and I'm probably gonna regret
this<00:03:11.280> because<00:03:11.580> I'm<00:03:11.670> probably<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.940> direct<00:03:12.239> that

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
this because I'm probably a direct that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.430 
this because I'm probably a direct that
towards<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> end<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.050> think<00:03:13.260> there's<00:03:13.410> like

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
towards the end and I think there's like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.890 
towards the end and I think there's like
a<00:03:13.530> team<00:03:13.770> over<00:03:14.280> here<00:03:14.520> which<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.239> hope<00:03:15.750> it's

and when they do work they work amazing

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.340 
and when they do work they work amazing
but<00:03:41.730> unfortunately<00:03:42.269> they<00:03:42.660> should<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:42.989> little

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
but unfortunately they should a little

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.690 
but unfortunately they should a little
lower<00:03:43.500> than<00:03:43.650> where<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.980> actually<00:03:44.130> where<00:03:44.610> you

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
lower than where you actually where you

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.430 
lower than where you actually where you
actually<00:03:44.850> aim<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.110> aim<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> little

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
actually aim so you have to aim a little

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.009 
actually aim so you have to aim a little
bit<00:03:46.650> higher<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.160> guess<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.940> there's<00:03:48.840> like<00:03:48.959> a

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
bit higher I guess and there's like a

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.330 
bit higher I guess and there's like a
half<00:03:49.290> second<00:03:49.620> lag<00:03:49.769> before<00:03:49.950> they<00:03:50.190> actually

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
half second lag before they actually

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.949 
half second lag before they actually
shoots<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:50.820> for<00:03:50.910> example<00:03:50.970> let's<00:03:51.329> try<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.870> on

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
shoots so for example let's try it on

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
wants to wreck us as well that I don't

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.930 
wants to wreck us as well that I don't
think<00:04:31.680> is<00:04:31.710> we're<00:04:32.100> not<00:04:32.190> gonna<00:04:32.310> allow<00:04:32.460> him<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.850> do

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
think is we're not gonna allow him to do

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.790 
think is we're not gonna allow him to do
that<00:04:32.970> because<00:04:33.180> we<00:04:33.330> just<00:04:33.570> freaking<00:04:33.930> destroyed

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
that because we just freaking destroyed

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.340 
that because we just freaking destroyed
six<00:04:35.400> people<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.820> think<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.720> we're<00:04:37.050> not<00:04:37.170> going<00:04:37.290> to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
six people I think so we're not going to

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.720 
six people I think so we're not going to
end<00:04:37.500> there<00:04:37.680> again<00:04:37.890> we're<00:04:38.100> going<00:04:38.250> on<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.460> seven

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
end there again we're going on the seven

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.090 
end there again we're going on the seven
kill<00:04:38.940> streak<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.600> their<00:04:40.380> chest<00:04:40.620> did<00:04:40.800> refuel

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
kill streak and their chest did refuel

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.590 
kill streak and their chest did refuel
so<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.250> guess<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.580> think<00:04:41.880> we<00:04:41.970> should<00:04:42.000> go<00:04:42.270> back<00:04:42.450> to

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
so I guess I think we should go back to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.510 
so I guess I think we should go back to
the<00:04:42.690> middle<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.770> hopefully<00:04:44.220> we<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.370> get<00:04:44.460> some

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
the middle and hopefully we can get some

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.580 
the middle and hopefully we can get some
better<00:04:44.730> stuff<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:45.120> pick<00:04:45.240> up<00:04:45.330> some<00:04:45.510> good<00:04:46.260> armor

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
better stuff and pick up some good armor

starting<00:05:40.169> in<00:05:40.229> three<00:05:40.440> minutes<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.979> I<00:05:41.580> mean

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
starting in three minutes and I mean

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.210 
starting in three minutes and I mean
it's<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:42.750> pretty<00:05:42.930> good<00:05:43.080> match<00:05:43.260> so<00:05:43.620> far<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.040> I'm

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
it's a pretty good match so far so I'm

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.100 
it's a pretty good match so far so I'm
pretty<00:05:44.550> pretty<00:05:45.150> happy<00:05:45.540> about<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:45.930> I'm

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
pretty pretty happy about that and I'm

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.780 
pretty pretty happy about that and I'm
playing<00:05:46.320> on<00:05:46.380> my<00:05:46.440> iphone<00:05:46.800> now<00:05:46.950> so<00:05:47.130> it's<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.400> think

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
playing on my iphone now so it's I think

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.000 
playing on my iphone now so it's I think
split<00:05:48.150> like<00:05:48.450> split<00:05:48.690> touch<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:48.930> pretty<00:05:49.229> easy<00:05:49.830> I

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
split like split touch is pretty easy I

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.820 
split like split touch is pretty easy I
guess<00:05:50.130> on<00:05:50.550> on<00:05:51.200> iphone<00:05:52.200> because<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.560> screen<00:05:52.770> is

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
guess on on iphone because the screen is

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.380 
guess on on iphone because the screen is
little<00:05:53.070> bit<00:05:53.160> smaller<00:05:53.460> but<00:05:53.640> my<00:05:53.760> fingers<00:05:54.240> are

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
little bit smaller but my fingers are

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.380 
little bit smaller but my fingers are
huge<00:05:54.870> so<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.640> that<00:05:57.000> might<00:05:57.120> be<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.240> little

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
huge so you know that might be a little

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.840 
huge so you know that might be a little
you<00:05:57.810> know<00:05:57.900> negative<00:05:58.140> for<00:05:58.620> me<00:05:58.770> since<00:05:59.700> they're
