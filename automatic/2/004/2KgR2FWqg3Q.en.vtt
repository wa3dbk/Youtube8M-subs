replace the one where the seal broke and
I<00:00:12.610> will<00:00:12.760> probably<00:00:12.880> use<00:00:13.120> for<00:00:13.450> some<00:00:13.570> sort<00:00:13.809> of

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
I will probably use for some sort of

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.519 
I will probably use for some sort of
terrarium<00:00:14.440> purpose<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:16.299> I<00:00:16.570> was<00:00:17.169> in<00:00:17.259> a<00:00:17.320> hurry

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
so I didn't realize that the tank it was

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.059 
so I didn't realize that the tank it was
chipped<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.630> it's<00:00:22.899> actually<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.499> pretty<00:00:23.710> ugly

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.069

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
the chip I normally I'm opposed to

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.130 
the chip I normally I'm opposed to
bandage<00:00:35.830> but<00:00:36.040> I'm<00:00:36.250> gonna<00:00:36.400> be<00:00:37.140> hopefully

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.360 

and<00:00:51.630> I<00:00:52.630> also<00:00:52.870> got<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.260> 1.5<00:00:53.770> gallon<00:00:54.460> cube

and I also got this 1.5 gallon cube

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.080 
and I also got this 1.5 gallon cube
which<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.700> its<00:00:58.239> plastic<00:00:58.600> if<00:00:58.989> i'm<00:00:59.110> not<00:00:59.260> mistaken

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
which is its plastic if i'm not mistaken

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.049 
which is its plastic if i'm not mistaken
but<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:02.230> thirty<00:01:02.560> dollars<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.310> what<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:03.700> I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
but was thirty dollars and what I I

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.819 
but was thirty dollars and what I I
realized<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.960> probably<00:01:05.199> do<00:01:05.469> a<00:01:05.499> lot<00:01:05.590> cheaper

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
realized you probably do a lot cheaper

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.529 
realized you probably do a lot cheaper
perhaps<00:01:06.460> running<00:01:06.929> like<00:01:07.929> a<00:01:08.039> 5.5<00:01:09.039> glass<00:01:09.969> with<00:01:10.509> a

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
perhaps running like a 5.5 glass with a

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.499 
perhaps running like a 5.5 glass with a
small<00:01:11.020> whisper<00:01:11.530> filter<00:01:11.859> is<00:01:11.979> like<00:01:12.159> what<00:01:12.369> 10<00:01:13.119> 10

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
small whisper filter is like what 10 10

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.950 
small whisper filter is like what 10 10
29<00:01:14.020> still<00:01:14.799> come<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.009> run<00:01:15.219> 30<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.600> what<00:01:16.719> I<00:01:16.749> like

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
29 still come to run 30 but what I like

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.609 
29 still come to run 30 but what I like
about<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.229> has<00:01:17.469> got<00:01:17.729> LED<00:01:18.729> lighting<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.499> I'm

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
about this has got LED lighting so I'm

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:21.929 
about this has got LED lighting so I'm
not<00:01:20.770> sure<00:01:20.829> how<00:01:20.979> good<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.399> is<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:21.729> growing

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
not sure how good that is for growing

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.529 
not sure how good that is for growing
plants<00:01:22.030> but<00:01:24.450> we'll<00:01:25.450> do<00:01:25.600> some<00:01:25.749> research<00:01:25.929> and

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
plants but we'll do some research and

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.699 
plants but we'll do some research and
decide<00:01:28.539> whether<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:28.899> want<00:01:28.929> to<00:01:29.109> keep<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.439> based

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
decide whether I want to keep it based

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.940 
decide whether I want to keep it based
on<00:01:29.859> that<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.689> let's<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:31.990> an<00:01:32.020> unboxing<00:01:32.229> and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
on that so let's do an unboxing and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.309 
on that so let's do an unboxing and
let's<00:01:33.490> see<00:01:33.670> what<00:01:33.789> it's<00:01:33.969> got<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.329> it's<00:01:34.479> got<00:01:34.630> 1.5

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
let's see what it's got so it's got 1.5

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.239 
let's see what it's got so it's got 1.5

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
we're not going to test this out because

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.480 
we're not going to test this out because
it<00:07:13.290> appears<00:07:13.590> that<00:07:13.650> if<00:07:13.830> you<00:07:13.920> plug<00:07:14.130> it<00:07:14.250> in<00:07:14.370> the

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
it appears that if you plug it in the

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.330 
it appears that if you plug it in the
filter<00:07:14.730> goes<00:07:15.000> off<00:07:15.240> automatically<00:07:15.900> and<00:07:16.340> it's

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
filter goes off automatically and it's

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.540 
filter goes off automatically and it's
not<00:07:17.550> good<00:07:17.790> to<00:07:17.820> run<00:07:18.060> your<00:07:18.210> impellers<00:07:18.600> right<00:07:18.990> so

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
not good to run your impellers right so

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.120 
not good to run your impellers right so
that's<00:07:20.550> a<00:07:20.670> no-no<00:07:20.850> shouldn't<00:07:21.630> have<00:07:21.720> done<00:07:21.900> that

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130
