00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.990
 Well, your case is a bit critical 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.850
 because it demands you do not want to have ever 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.100
 used nothing in your life you are in the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.530
 step number zero and you can not give a 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.689
 step from step zero to step 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.659
 number eight or number 9 where I am 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.700
 where I already have a very religious regime 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.320
 of skin care so for what 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.289
 it was going to be the easiest thing and at this moment 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.929
 you have to start with a care 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.189
 basic ingredients and basic products 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.850
 to take care of your skin 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.610
 you need a facial cleanser you need 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.039
 a moisturizer and you need a 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 sunscreen and of course follow 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.020
 all the mask tips that I'm 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.580
 giving every week here if you're going to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.319
 ask but what products do I buy 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.390
 first you have to know what kind of 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.580
 skin if you have dry skin because 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.060
 you get products for dry skin to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.039
 oily skin or for normal skin ok es es 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 where you have to start first that 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.260
 nothing in the number zero in the basics to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.750
 take care of your skin then little by little and 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.320
 we are going up to create a regime 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.910
 suitable to your purpose where do you want 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.610
 get where you want to take your skin and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.060
 what are the areas that concern you ok 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.970
 the next question is of wake 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.340
 sanchez and says hello I have a problem 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.070
 with my hair when I applied a dye 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.070
 I do not last much longer than a 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.950
 week I can do 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.140
 beloved stela believe me the one who believes me 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.500
 what are the only happens your 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.290
 problem is not in your hair you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.870
 problem is what your hair has 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.000
 can be many factors one maybe 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.060
 already your hair is so consumed or has 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.650
 so much chemical product in your 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.140
 hair that she is very difficult to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.810
 another dye object will stay on it and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.520
 fast is washed away another point can be 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.650
 that the dye you're consuming 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.110
 maybe it's not a very good dye 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.480
 quality that you put it on and it gets washed 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.760
 maybe if a temporary dye you have tried 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.620
 apply some permanent dye 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.660
 another problem may be forgiveness 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.470
 you are having the cares 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.270
 suitable for hair 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.150
 remember that when a hair is 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.560
 dyed you need to last you 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.020
 you need to wash it with shampoo to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.390
 dyed hair and use conditioner 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.250
 for dyed hair you also have to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.900
 Be careful when you wash it 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.050
 a lot of hot water and it has to be 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.970
 warm or cold water much better if it's 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.340
 you have so much chemical and in your hair and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.020
 it's best that you stop doing that and you 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.600
 Give your hair a rest for a 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.030
 rest long a few six seven 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.730
 months up to a year so that your 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.380
 Hair is healthy and virgin again 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.920
 again so that when you put a 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.540
 new dye I grabbed it from flown ok 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.430
 I hope and this answer will take you out of your 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.310
 doubts and if not then you know where 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.770
 find me to follow up on your 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.610
 to your house very well the other question 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.140
 comes from 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.770
 omar silva and says yasmani could you 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.590
 help 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.209
 rolando me the data that cream recommends 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.220
 is to moisturize the skin 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.840
 omar loves me love that phrase that tells me is 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.320
 roll roll am the data has passed the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.000
 I love to take data for a matter of 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.950
 moisturizers I understand that 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.830
 be without confusion because you go to the 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.080
 shop and you look hundreds of creams 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.300
 moisturizing for the skin that is very 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.950
 difficult to get some what you have 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.230
 to know when you are going to buy a cream 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.540
 moisturizing is your skin type 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.760
 If you have dry skin and fat or skin 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.280
 with acne these I'm going to mention 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.140
 right now is an important point to 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.440
 select a good moisturizer 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.200
 If you have a oily skin look for creams 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.020
 gel-based moisturizers if you have a 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.140
 Dry skin looks for a moisturizing cream 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.810
 super super heavy creamy base you will 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.850
 help a lot that you have to take in 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.980
 count these two points for the time of 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.560
 that you get a moisturizer though 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.310
 I hope these answers are 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.500
 very useful 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.390
