00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 tega everything I find for a 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.130
 video on my beauty box so I 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.200
 think you know for the one who 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.460
 Follow me since it's a box that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 I present you since the month 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.450
 from October now October-November 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.429
 concept has changed very recently 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 normally it's more a beauty box 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 that we receive every month but all 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.520
 two months so necessarily the price is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.130
 more expensive so it's a voice that costs 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 29 euros but 32 with postage 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.609
 so 32nd finals this is one every 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.050
 two me so it comes down to the same as a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.340
 by month and with this time we are 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.779
 assured to have a minimum rank 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.669
 reproduced league we are seven 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.210

 Cuticle oil from my home 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:06.900
 beautiful spas so it's a spa thing 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:08.220
 so it's like the one that has 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.200
 a little pipette the species of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.270
 small pears that smell extremely good 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.799
 cleansers and droppings that pretty cool 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.590

 gets up 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.160
 I think that 's what his lips are 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.440
 so two that comes from paris bobo vine 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.820

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.650
 to activate microcirculation 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.100
 superficial epidermis 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.090
 an immediate freshness effect during that 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.740
 not come to pregnant women I 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 prefer to say it must be applied so 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.630
 knee toes massaging 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 slightly very pretty product also even 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.140
 if my sense we do not care it's more 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.880
 is it effective but the same 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.040
 I can not wait to test since I often 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.230
 heavy legs especially when it does 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.540
 super hot like that again a product 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.660
 very interesting and very useful with these 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 hot weather other products that I have 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.690
 tested this time and I did not think that 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.270
 it would be great that I will test in 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.520
 first is a brain a bar bob 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.610
 it's an argan scientist I've never 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.500
 tested this curious with his always 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.020
 attracted game so here they have we 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.160
 sent one of the mark Morocco esteem so 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.840
 it's a bit solid 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.520
 anticipations' see a lot with the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.730
 sun is a little greenish and that makes 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.780
 like that in the jar I used it no 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.860
 necessarily it was more beautiful and early 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.820
 so here and in fact it's a species 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.010
 so as a kind of freezing a 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.840
 little hard 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.120

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.459
 it's explained behind I used it 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.220
 it's pretty weird the use of this 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.480
 bar this scientist so it's like a soap 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.610
 usual and but it's nice that cleans 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.989
 really good that helps to erase the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.680
 skin after finally I'm nice this is it 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.720

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.370

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.260

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.340

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:42.960

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.580
 code that you say a Swiss brand and 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.800

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.330
 to have this in his last box 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.310

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.530
 here I know I 'm not going too much 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.099

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.610
 I like pink polish why 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.449
 would definitely not use it 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.639
 not possible this sun 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.310
 sorry the conditions at which game movies 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.419
 are atrocious so here is a little varnish 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.020
 nice pink and the favorite product 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.719
 larks 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.279
 I did not try but I test them 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:21.509
 me if I test so in fact we received 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:24.090
 I received a mango butter enriched with 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.580
 shea butter for hair 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.120
 fragile and dry also for skin 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.830
 dried 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.379
 it can be applied as a mask on 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.180
 hair and also on the areas the 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.159
 more dry so legs feet etc 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.770
 I used it a little bit on my feet 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.060
 precisely what I have the feet that 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.669
 take a lot of sun since bah du 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.529
 always kick in and foot that's who the 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.789
 skin to take a little pride I the 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:49.560
 test I never felt a thing 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.909
 and when I say that it smells good it is 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.779
 it does not smell good it 's divinely 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.520
 good it feels a little financial the shutter 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.500
 this kind of cake smells a little I 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.509
 find it's a killer and texture 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.279
 is just great it's so funny 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.960
 as textures I did not have you 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.830
 describe the texture because it's enough 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.870
 special 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.659
 it's a bit like a bit rigid 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:16.319
 here are some cons as soon as we pass these 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:19.110
 hydrates and it goes away and that makes me 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.339
 think me m and weigh 2 when cutting 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.849
 a small share of financiers etc one 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.639
 sniffs 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.080
 it makes me think about that it's crazy 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.969
 that's why I'm going to introduce you 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.740
 this box just because I'm 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.180
 am unsubscribed and of all the boxes that 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.440
 I had before the year michael boxing ago 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.580
 long time 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.040
 and there I undressed the 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.720
 glossybox since although from time to time 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.610
 time there were really boxes 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.440
 very nice there were too often 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.270
 cans 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.380
 unfortunately for which I 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.840
 find that he had not really done 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.460
 forms either at the level of 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.810
 product budget or even at the level of 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.260
 what was my product was not 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.120
 terrible 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.620
 So now I have more than my 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.050
 voting box for now I've never 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.940
 been disappointed by this box 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.260
 here I put you the site in nothing to a 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.600
 edge of a fake as usual for those 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.460
 that it interests and the mango butter 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.760

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.430
