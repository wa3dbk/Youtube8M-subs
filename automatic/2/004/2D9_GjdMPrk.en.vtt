00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 british matt pro i traveled the whole world in 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.520
 london kiwi and even committed 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:21.779
 climbing everest and now he 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:23.699
 went to a new journey from Islam 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 at this time we sent a crossed 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.670
 frozen bike on a motorcycle 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.470
 rt correspondent 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.000
 Yegor Piskunov met with the seeker 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 adventures to find out what was 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 due to his choice on baikal 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.410
 motorcycle like this idea came to you in 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.379
 head i bumped into her on the internet 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.540
 I realized that such an adventure attracts 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.210
 for many reasons, I decided to find out about 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 Baikal more I looked at the lake and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.379
 thought it would be a big deal 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 adventure when you find yourself on 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 Baikal stands only away from places 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 chosen by tourists and you get into 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.239
 the kingdom is completely wild around 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 nobody and nothing 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.829
 this was the main reason for 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.390
 which I decided to go here 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 amazing adventure total in group 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.460
 there were eight motorcycles on each of them 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.619
 except for one sat on 2 people have these 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.840
 people have a lot of experience and they came 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.880
 from all over the world so this project 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.189
 took place thanks to the efforts of a whole 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 international team 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 Baikal is the deepest lake in the world in which 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.920
 contains 5 part of world reserves 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.009
 fresh water is a national monument 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.299
 nature he is under the protection of unesco 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.180
 however behind this breathtaking 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.740
 beauty lurking danger alone 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 the guy tried to slow down 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.939
 he made it forced a motorcycle 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 hit the ice he cracked the crew 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.590
 found himself in the water but people quickly jumped off 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 from a motorcycle it all happened on my 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.159
 eyes and reminded me that we 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.829
 are on the surface of the frozen 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.530
 lakes they are on solid ground and there are 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.430
 chance to fall under the ice chance we 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.159
 can fall builders 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.740
 you had a Soviet motorcycle on which 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.719
 you had to cross the whole lake before 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.549
 largest in the world before 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.070
 the ice surface of the lake is very 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.469
 diverse it is constantly changing 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 so the only way to cross it 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.649
 if there is no bridge 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.849
 and here it is not there to make something 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.770
 like cattle 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.360
 maximize speed and save 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.160
 gained speed with what else 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.840
 difficulties in 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.510
 had to face where you slept that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.550
 ate most of the time we slept in 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.950
 tents once we decided to spend the night 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.320
 on the lake in sleeping bags we 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.780
 wanted to test their quality to taste 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.430
 new sensations as regards nutrition we 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 ate foods that give the body 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 energy used something that is easy 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.100
 cook melted snow and boiled 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.810
 this water 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.740

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.220
