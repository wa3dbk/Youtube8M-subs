hi<00:00:07.240> in<00:00:07.540> this<00:00:07.600> clip<00:00:08.320> we're<00:00:08.530> going<00:00:08.560> to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.770 
hi in this clip we're going to

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.799 
hi in this clip we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.460> gene<00:00:09.880> regulation<00:00:10.360> of<00:00:10.660> the

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
demonstrate the gene regulation of the

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.200 
demonstrate the gene regulation of the
e.coli<00:00:11.139> lac<00:00:11.500> operon<00:00:11.920> as<00:00:12.130> you<00:00:12.790> remember<00:00:13.180> from

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
e.coli lac operon as you remember from

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.420 
e.coli lac operon as you remember from
the<00:00:13.450> lecture<00:00:13.630> clips<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.500> lac<00:00:14.710> operon<00:00:15.160> is<00:00:15.220> a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
the lecture clips the lac operon is a

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.609 
the lecture clips the lac operon is a
collection<00:00:15.850> of<00:00:16.090> genes<00:00:16.330> that<00:00:16.930> produces<00:00:17.470> the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
collection of genes that produces the

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.470 
collection of genes that produces the
lactose<00:00:18.040> metabolism<00:00:18.610> machinery<00:00:19.210> when

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
lactose metabolism machinery when

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.410 
lactose metabolism machinery when
expressed<00:00:20.099> now<00:00:21.099> when<00:00:21.580> these<00:00:21.760> are<00:00:21.940> expressed

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
expressed now when these are expressed

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.010 
expressed now when these are expressed
ecole<00:00:23.320> a<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.740> able<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.220> metabolize<00:00:24.520> lactose

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
ecole a is able to metabolize lactose

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.470 
ecole a is able to metabolize lactose
however<00:00:26.020> it<00:00:26.350> prefers<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:27.400> metabolize<00:00:27.760> glucose

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
however it prefers to metabolize glucose

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.769 
however it prefers to metabolize glucose
to<00:00:28.810> use<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.230> as<00:00:29.470> its<00:00:29.710> sugar<00:00:30.070> thus<00:00:31.029> when

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
to use that as its sugar thus when

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.960 
to use that as its sugar thus when
there's<00:00:32.260> glucose<00:00:32.830> available<00:00:33.010> to<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:33.730> cell

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
there's glucose available to the cell

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.439 
there's glucose available to the cell
it's<00:00:34.270> pointless<00:00:35.019> for<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.940> create<00:00:36.940> this

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
it's pointless for it to create this

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.049 
it's pointless for it to create this
machinery<00:00:38.050> because<00:00:38.770> it's<00:00:39.430> not<00:00:39.640> going<00:00:39.940> to

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
machinery because it's not going to

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.880 
machinery because it's not going to
actually<00:00:40.210> use<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.899> it's<00:00:41.110> going<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:41.470> metabolize

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
actually use it it's going to metabolize

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.880 
actually use it it's going to metabolize
the<00:00:42.250> glucose<00:00:42.640> instead<00:00:43.149> but<00:00:43.989> when<00:00:44.230> we<00:00:44.500> remove

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
the glucose instead but when we remove

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.250 
the glucose instead but when we remove
glucose<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.850> add<00:00:46.030> lactose<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.630> you<00:00:46.960> coli

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
glucose and add lactose that you coli

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.840 
glucose and add lactose that you coli
absolutely<00:00:48.010> needs<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.399> be<00:00:48.579> able<00:00:48.700> to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
absolutely needs to be able to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.420 
absolutely needs to be able to
metabolize<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:49.930> lactose<00:00:50.379> otherwise<00:00:51.190> it's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
metabolize this lactose otherwise it's

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.069 
metabolize this lactose otherwise it's
not<00:00:51.550> going<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.969> be<00:00:52.090> able<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.329> grow<00:00:52.570> with<00:00:52.809> the

not going to be able to grow with the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.540 
not going to be able to grow with the
available<00:00:53.530> energy<00:00:53.649> source<00:00:54.510> thus<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:57.129> have<00:00:57.340> a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
available energy source thus we have a

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.790 
available energy source thus we have a
couple<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:58.059> different<00:00:58.390> situations<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:59.620> we

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
couple of different situations when we

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.510 
couple of different situations when we
have<00:01:00.070> glucose<00:01:00.610> present<00:01:00.940> but<00:01:01.719> not<00:01:01.750> lactose<00:01:02.590> we

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
have glucose present but not lactose we

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.300 
have glucose present but not lactose we
do<00:01:03.820> not<00:01:04.089> want<00:01:04.899> to<00:01:05.610> express<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.880> lac<00:01:07.060> operon

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
do not want to express the lac operon

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.969 
do not want to express the lac operon
however<00:01:09.310> when<00:01:10.000> we<00:01:10.179> remove<00:01:10.660> glucose<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.470> we

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
however when we remove glucose and we

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.590 
however when we remove glucose and we
add<00:01:12.130> lactose<00:01:12.880> we<00:01:13.660> do<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.729> express<00:01:16.209> the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
add lactose we do want to express the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.419 
add lactose we do want to express the
lac<00:01:16.780> operon<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:18.759> we've<00:01:19.330> covered<00:01:20.190> when<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
lac operon now we've covered when the

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.760 
lac operon now we've covered when the
e.coli<00:01:21.819> would<00:01:22.360> like<00:01:22.569> to<00:01:22.810> express<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.410> operon

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
e.coli would like to express this operon

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.880 
e.coli would like to express this operon
however<00:01:24.670> how<00:01:25.330> can<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.929> express<00:01:26.319> this<00:01:26.530> operon

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
however how can it express this operon

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.460 
however how can it express this operon
only<00:01:27.789> when<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.240> wants<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:28.599> and<00:01:28.959> not<00:01:29.140> when<00:01:29.349> it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
only when it wants to and not when it

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.010 
only when it wants to and not when it
doesn't<00:01:29.860> that's<00:01:30.729> where<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.300> promoter<00:01:31.509> comes

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
doesn't that's where the promoter comes

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.059 
doesn't that's where the promoter comes
into<00:01:32.349> play<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:34.090> promoter<00:01:34.539> is<00:01:34.840> where<00:01:35.410> RNA

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
into play the promoter is where RNA

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.040 
into play the promoter is where RNA
polymerase<00:01:36.520> binds<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.240> RNA<00:01:37.630> polymerase

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
polymerase binds and RNA polymerase

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.410 
polymerase binds and RNA polymerase
needs<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.740> bind<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.069> this<00:01:39.190> promoter<00:01:39.640> in<00:01:39.880> order

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
needs to bind to this promoter in order

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.120 
needs to bind to this promoter in order
to<00:01:40.599> transcribe<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.500> express<00:01:42.280> these<00:01:42.520> genes<00:01:42.910> in

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to transcribe and express these genes in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.309 
to transcribe and express these genes in
this<00:01:45.130> particular<00:01:45.729> promoter<00:01:46.060> we<00:01:46.450> have<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.990> site

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
this particular promoter we have a site

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.919 
this particular promoter we have a site
where<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> repressor<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.849> bind<00:01:49.090> in<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.690> site

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
where a repressor can bind in a site

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.639 
where a repressor can bind in a site
where<00:01:50.259> an<00:01:50.380> activator<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.220> bind<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.959> have<00:01:53.349> a

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
where an activator can bind so I have a

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:02.690 
where an activator can bind so I have a
repressor<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:58.060> have<00:01:58.270> an<00:01:58.509> activator<00:02:01.319> so

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
repressor and I have an activator so

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.479 
repressor and I have an activator so
when<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.149> repressor<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:04.929> bound<00:02:05.489> polymerase

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
when the repressor is bound polymerase

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:10.080 
when the repressor is bound polymerase
cannot<00:02:07.090> bind<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> promoter<00:02:09.090> polymerase

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
cannot bind to the promoter polymerase

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.170 
cannot bind to the promoter polymerase
also<00:02:10.750> needs<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.800> activator<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.760> bound<00:02:13.000> to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
also needs the activator to be bound to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.559 
also needs the activator to be bound to
the<00:02:13.209> promoter<00:02:13.420> in<00:02:13.870> order<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.409> bind<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.879> how<00:02:16.329> can

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
the promoter in order to bind so how can

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.980 
the promoter in order to bind so how can
that<00:02:16.659> you<00:02:16.750> call<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:16.989> regulate<00:02:17.650> when<00:02:18.310> the

an activator or bound to the promoter
well<00:02:22.340> when<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:23.700> lactose<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> system

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
well when we have lactose in the system

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.510 
well when we have lactose in the system
I<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:26.670> lactose<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.950> repressor

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
only binds to the promoter when there is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.340 
only binds to the promoter when there is
no<00:02:34.590> lactose<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:35.580> binding<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.840> lactose

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
no lactose and when binding to lactose

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.370 
no lactose and when binding to lactose
the<00:02:38.310> repressor<00:02:38.880> comes<00:02:39.510> undone<00:02:40.020> from<00:02:40.290> the

the repressor comes undone from the
promoter<00:02:42.410> how<00:02:43.410> does<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.800> cell<00:02:44.010> tell<00:02:44.520> whether

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
promoter how does the cell tell whether

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.960 
promoter how does the cell tell whether
there's<00:02:45.420> glucose<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.110> cell<00:02:46.230> or<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.970> when

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
there's glucose in the cell or not when

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.420 
there's glucose in the cell or not when
glucose<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.510> low<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.620> cell<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.400> cell

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
glucose is low in the cell the cell

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.180 
glucose is low in the cell the cell
makes<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.210> molecule<00:02:51.720> called<00:02:51.930> cyclic<00:02:52.440> AMP<00:02:52.800> II<00:02:52.980> or

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
makes a molecule called cyclic AMP II or

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.880 
makes a molecule called cyclic AMP II or
camp<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.820> have<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.600> molecule<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.200> camp<00:02:55.560> right

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
camp I have a molecule of camp right

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.060 
camp I have a molecule of camp right
here<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.600> camp<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.470> cells<00:02:58.710> way<00:02:58.920> of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
here and so camp is the cells way of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.160 
here and so camp is the cells way of
indicating<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.700> there<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.120> low<00:03:00.450> glucose<00:03:00.930> in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
indicating that there is low glucose in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.850 
indicating that there is low glucose in
the<00:03:01.200> cell<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.880> activator<00:03:03.540> needs<00:03:04.020> camp<00:03:04.440> to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
the cell the activator needs camp to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.120 
the cell the activator needs camp to
bind<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.640> activator<00:03:06.120> binding<00:03:06.570> site<00:03:07.130> when

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
bind to the activator binding site when

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.690 
bind to the activator binding site when
camp<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.700> removed<00:03:09.120> or<00:03:09.410> glucose<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.590> added<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
camp is removed or glucose is added the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700 
camp is removed or glucose is added the
activator<00:03:12.300> cannot<00:03:13.050> bind<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> promoter

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
activator cannot bind to the promoter

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.700 
activator cannot bind to the promoter
anymore

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
anymore

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.870 
anymore
okay<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:16.770> let's<00:03:17.190> give<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.460> a<00:03:17.610> try

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
okay so let's give it a try

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.270 
okay so let's give it a try
in<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:19.590> first<00:03:19.920> situation<00:03:21.410> we<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.680> glucose

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
in this first situation we have glucose

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.730 
in this first situation we have glucose
we<00:03:24.180> don't<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.720> lactose<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:26.520> have<00:03:26.880> neither

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
we don't have lactose so I have neither

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:35.950 
we don't have lactose so I have neither
my<00:03:28.740> lactose<00:03:29.280> nor<00:03:30.120> my<00:03:30.300> camp<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.170> system

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.020 

repressor<00:03:36.960> can<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.320> bind<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:38.490> repressor<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
repressor can you bind the repressor is

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.050 
repressor can you bind the repressor is
bound<00:03:39.180> activator<00:03:40.170> can<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.590> bind<00:03:40.830> no<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
bound activator can you bind no the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.120 
bound activator can you bind no the
activator<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.990> bound<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.590> repressor<00:03:44.100> is

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
activator is not bound the repressor is

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.990 
activator is not bound the repressor is
bound<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.930> when<00:03:46.650> RNA<00:03:47.070> polymerase<00:03:47.520> comes

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
bound and so when RNA polymerase comes

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.840 
bound and so when RNA polymerase comes
to<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:48.300> promoter<00:03:48.740> RNA<00:03:49.740> polymerase<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.460> not

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
to the promoter RNA polymerase is not

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.350 
to the promoter RNA polymerase is not
able<00:03:51.210> to<00:03:51.510> bind<00:03:51.720> at<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.290> promoter<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.360> thus

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
able to bind at this promoter and thus

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.600 
able to bind at this promoter and thus
it's<00:03:54.750> not<00:03:55.110> able<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.680> express<00:03:56.100> these<00:03:56.520> genes

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
it's not able to express these genes

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.870 
it's not able to express these genes
okay<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.360> as<00:04:00.600> we<00:04:01.170> can<00:04:01.350> see<00:04:01.590> here<00:04:01.980> there<00:04:02.640> is

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
okay and so as we can see here there is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.350 
okay and so as we can see here there is
no<00:04:03.240> expression<00:04:03.720> in<00:04:04.250> this<00:04:05.250> second<00:04:05.700> situation

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
no expression in this second situation

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.590 
no expression in this second situation
we<00:04:06.900> have<00:04:07.140> no<00:04:07.590> glucose<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.430> we<00:04:09.060> do<00:04:09.300> have

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
we have no glucose and we do have

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.110 
we have no glucose and we do have
lactose<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.440> I'm<00:04:11.130> going<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.670> since<00:04:11.970> I'm

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
lactose so I'm going to since I'm

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.660 
lactose so I'm going to since I'm
removing<00:04:12.480> glucose<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.470> am<00:04:14.070> adding<00:04:14.550> back<00:04:14.820> camp

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
removing glucose I am adding back camp

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.760 
removing glucose I am adding back camp
activator<00:04:17.670> can<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.120> bind<00:04:18.440> activator<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.620> now

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
activator can you bind activator is now

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.900 
activator can you bind activator is now
bound<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.370> I'm<00:04:21.030> also<00:04:21.299> adding<00:04:22.520> lactose<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.790> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
bound and I'm also adding lactose to the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.960 
bound and I'm also adding lactose to the
system<00:04:26.390> repressor<00:04:27.390> can't<00:04:27.870> bind<00:04:28.140> anymore<00:04:28.970> so

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
system repressor can't bind anymore so

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.120 
system repressor can't bind anymore so
what<00:04:30.180> do<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.540> at<00:04:30.690> my<00:04:30.810> promoter<00:04:31.169> now<00:04:31.440> RNA

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
what do I have at my promoter now RNA

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.830 
what do I have at my promoter now RNA
polymerase

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840

along and find only an activator at the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.290 
along and find only an activator at the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
promoter the polymerase can thus bind to

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.260 
promoter the polymerase can thus bind to
the<00:04:38.389> promoter<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:39.280> move<00:04:40.280> downstream<00:04:40.850> to

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
the promoter and move downstream to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.570 
the promoter and move downstream to
transcribe<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.080> express<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:43.070> lactose

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.500 

so<00:04:53.330> we've<00:04:53.810> now<00:04:54.050> covered<00:04:54.350> how<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.510> e.coli

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
so we've now covered how the e.coli

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.189 
so we've now covered how the e.coli
organism<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:57.620> able<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.750> regulate<00:04:59.750> the
