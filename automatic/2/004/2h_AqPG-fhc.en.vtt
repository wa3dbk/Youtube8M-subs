00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150 

so<00:00:00.149> in<00:00:00.299> dailies<00:00:00.630> real

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.980 

just<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.310> D<00:00:05.430> chord<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.819> f-sharp<00:00:06.000> there

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.020 

one<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:12.469> things<00:00:12.650> I<00:00:12.740> notice<00:00:13.070> about<00:00:13.219> least

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
one of the things I notice about least

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.029 
one of the things I notice about least
with<00:00:14.180> my<00:00:14.299> own<00:00:14.420> playing<00:00:14.750> I<00:00:15.019> do<00:00:15.469> a<00:00:15.590> pull<00:00:15.889> off

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
with my own playing I do a pull off

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.250 
with my own playing I do a pull off
right<00:00:16.189> there

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.130 

I<00:00:21.290> tend<00:00:22.130> that's<00:00:22.310> where<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:22.520> sort<00:00:23.030> of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
I tend that's where I sort of

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.930 
I tend that's where I sort of
subconsciously<00:00:24.140> interject<00:00:25.100> those<00:00:25.280> pull-offs

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
subconsciously interject those pull-offs

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.750 
subconsciously interject those pull-offs
and<00:00:26.060> hammer-ons<00:00:26.980> because<00:00:27.980> I'm<00:00:28.280> sort<00:00:28.700> of

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
and hammer-ons because I'm sort of

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.070 
and hammer-ons because I'm sort of
paying<00:00:28.910> attention<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.570> tension<00:00:29.900> in<00:00:29.990> the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
paying attention to the tension in the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.589 
paying attention to the tension in the
right<00:00:30.230> hand<00:00:30.500> back<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:31.010> that<00:00:31.190> and<00:00:31.970> if<00:00:32.270> I<00:00:32.360> tried

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
right hand back to that and if I tried

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.790 
right hand back to that and if I tried
to<00:00:32.720> play<00:00:32.900> those<00:00:38.320> your<00:00:39.320> other<00:00:39.440> notes<00:00:39.650> get

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
to play those your other notes get

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.370 
to play those your other notes get
chopped<00:00:40.070> off<00:00:40.220> you<00:00:40.550> know

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.810 

and<00:00:46.380> it's<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.040> trying<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> imagine

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and it's more of just trying to imagine

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.030 
and it's more of just trying to imagine
this<00:00:48.150> these<00:00:48.540> notes<00:00:48.810> just<00:00:49.020> falling<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.740> know

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
this these notes just falling you know

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.710 
this these notes just falling you know
waterfall<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.060> notes<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:57.180> thought<00:00:57.630> you

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
waterfall kind of notes I thought you

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.940 
waterfall kind of notes I thought you
could<00:00:57.870> hear<00:00:58.050> where<00:00:58.200> I<00:00:58.230> went<00:00:58.380> back<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.860> of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
could hear where I went back to more of

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.590 
could hear where I went back to more of
picking<00:00:59.280> every<00:00:59.520> note<00:00:59.700> from<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> hammer-ons

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
picking every note from the hammer-ons

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.300 
picking every note from the hammer-ons
and<00:01:00.690> pull-offs

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.250 

play<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.430> eight<00:01:10.550> parts<00:01:10.730> lower<00:01:10.970> again

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.899 

yeah

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.320 

and<00:01:26.080> then<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.229> B<00:01:27.350> part<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:28.549> B<00:01:28.670> part<00:01:28.880> starts<00:01:29.180> on

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
and then the B part the B part starts on

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.560 
and then the B part the B part starts on
C

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.590 

they<00:01:37.260> click<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> d7

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
they click on the d7

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.649 
they click on the d7
right<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> G<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.500> then

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.039 

and<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.380> passage<00:01:45.040> right<00:01:45.219> there<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:49.869> pull

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
and that passage right there more pull

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.090 
and that passage right there more pull
off<00:01:50.229> some<00:01:50.409> things

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.889 

that's<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.340> one<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.520> use<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> lot<00:01:55.999> again

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that's the one I use a lot again

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.749 
that's the one I use a lot again
the<00:01:58.350> pull-offs<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> hammer-ons<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.640> get

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the pull-offs and hammer-ons you get

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940 
the pull-offs and hammer-ons you get
that<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> rest<00:02:00.810> stroke<00:02:01.320> count<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that more the rest stroke count as a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
that more the rest stroke count as a
concept<00:02:02.429> we're<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:03.570> pulling<00:02:03.899> into<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
concept we're actually pulling into the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.969 
concept we're actually pulling into the
string<00:02:04.590> below

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.400 

Oh

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.360 

here's<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> B<00:02:11.490> part<00:02:11.640> again<00:02:11.910> 1<00:02:12.690> 2<00:02:13.350> 3

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.580 

Oh

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.030 

and<00:02:34.410> another<00:02:35.410> thing<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.620> would<00:02:35.680> say<00:02:36.010> about

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and another thing I would say about

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.790 
and another thing I would say about
hammer-ons<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:36.940> pull-offs<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
hammer-ons and pull-offs and just a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.199 
hammer-ons and pull-offs and just a
general<00:02:39.010> sense<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> timing<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:39.940> dailies

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
general sense of timing and dailies

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.900 
general sense of timing and dailies
dailies<00:02:40.540> reels<00:02:40.720> another<00:02:41.640> especially<00:02:42.640> that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
dailies reels another especially that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.080 
dailies reels another especially that
lick<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.330> B<00:02:43.450> part<00:02:43.660> there<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.940> another<00:02:45.940> way

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
lick and the B part there is another way

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.540 
lick and the B part there is another way
to<00:02:46.150> sort<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:47.190> can't<00:02:48.190> emphasize<00:02:48.310> enough

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
to sort of I can't emphasize enough

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.300 
to sort of I can't emphasize enough
about<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.510> timing<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.560> having<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.010> sense<00:02:51.220> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
about just timing and having a sense of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.860 
about just timing and having a sense of
how<00:02:51.459> these<00:02:51.610> notes<00:02:51.880> fall<00:02:52.560> yeah<00:02:57.690> one<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.720> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
how these notes fall yeah one of the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.820 
how these notes fall yeah one of the
things<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.170> makes<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.410> hammer-ons<00:02:59.739> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
things that makes the hammer-ons and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.009 
things that makes the hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.459> effective<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:01.060> two<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.420> when

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
pull-offs more effective as two is when

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.500 
pull-offs more effective as two is when
you<00:03:02.739> get<00:03:03.040> more<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.370> sense<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:04.090> log<00:03:04.299> in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
you get more of a sense of just log in

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.940 
you get more of a sense of just log in
like<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.750> say<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.049> melody<00:03:05.349> then<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.650> do<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
like I say the melody then you do the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.640 
like I say the melody then you do the
actual<00:03:06.250> technique<00:03:06.610> behind<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.060> melody<00:03:07.360> just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.039 

it<00:03:11.650> all<00:03:11.739> comes<00:03:12.310> out<00:03:12.430> cleanly<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.090> clearly<00:03:16.049> and

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
it all comes out cleanly and clearly and

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.089 
it all comes out cleanly and clearly and
one<00:03:17.140> of<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.290> ways<00:03:17.440> that's<00:03:17.620> neat<00:03:17.739> about<00:03:17.769> fiddle

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
one of the ways that's neat about fiddle

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.350 
one of the ways that's neat about fiddle
tunes<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.549> they<00:03:18.670> all<00:03:18.790> sort<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.120> have<00:03:19.180> that

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.180 

and<00:03:23.810> again<00:03:24.050> back<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.500> my<00:03:24.680> right<00:03:24.920> hand

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
and again back to the my right hand

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.840 
and again back to the my right hand
technique<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:27.800> can<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:28.280> start<00:03:28.520> by<00:03:28.610> over

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
technique so I can you can start by over

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.980 
technique so I can you can start by over
emphasizing<00:03:29.270> that

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.600 

as<00:03:33.990> in<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.200> fiddle<00:03:34.470> bow<00:03:34.590> James<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.280> kazoos

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
as in the fiddle bow James a kazoos

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.559 
as in the fiddle bow James a kazoos
again<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.360> know

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.710 

and<00:03:40.750> as<00:03:40.959> I'm<00:03:41.380> building<00:03:41.530> technique<00:03:42.330> as<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.390> have

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and as I'm building technique as I have

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.809 
and as I'm building technique as I have
built<00:03:43.959> technique<00:03:44.530> over<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.830> years<00:03:45.010> and

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
built technique over the years and

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.220 
built technique over the years and
encourage<00:03:46.150> other<00:03:46.300> people<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.750> their<00:03:46.930> building

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
encourage other people in their building

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.580 
encourage other people in their building
is<00:03:47.349> to<00:03:48.280> be<00:03:49.180> really<00:03:49.510> conscious<00:03:49.720> once<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.349> sort

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
is to be really conscious once you sort

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.770 
is to be really conscious once you sort
of<00:03:50.620> feel<00:03:50.739> like<00:03:50.890> you've<00:03:51.010> got<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.459> good<00:03:52.360> handle<00:03:52.690> on

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
of feel like you've got a good handle on

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.630 
of feel like you've got a good handle on
how<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.959> make<00:03:53.200> notes<00:03:53.560> clean<00:03:54.010> cleanly<00:03:54.520> and

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
how to make notes clean cleanly and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.270 
how to make notes clean cleanly and
clearly<00:03:55.030> sort<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.750> think<00:03:55.930> salat<00:03:56.769> more<00:03:56.950> solidly

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
clearly sort of think salat more solidly

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.360 
clearly sort of think salat more solidly
about<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.640> rhythm<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:59.380> way<00:03:59.860> I<00:03:59.890> would<00:04:00.099> sort<00:04:00.310> of

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
about the rhythm so way I would sort of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:11.150 
about the rhythm so way I would sort of
attack<00:04:00.610> that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.510 

I'm<00:04:11.640> over<00:04:11.850> emphasizing<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.480> there<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:13.520> it

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
I'm over emphasizing it there but it

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.850 
I'm over emphasizing it there but it
makes<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:15.090> makes<00:04:15.300> your<00:04:15.420> playing<00:04:15.860> more

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
makes it makes your playing more

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.930 
makes it makes your playing more
effective<00:04:17.310> when<00:04:17.430> there's<00:04:17.580> more<00:04:17.730> rhythm

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
effective when there's more rhythm

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.600 
effective when there's more rhythm
behind<00:04:18.150> behind<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.930> lead<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:20.310> lead<00:04:20.489> that's

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
behind behind the lead the lead that's

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.980 
behind behind the lead the lead that's
going<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:23.220> just<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.490> matter<00:04:23.670> of<00:04:23.990> again

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
going on and it's just a matter of again

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.570 
going on and it's just a matter of again
listening<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.620> yourself<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.280> want<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.490> be

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
listening to yourself and you want to be

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.730 
listening to yourself and you want to be
able<00:04:26.670> to<00:04:26.910> as<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.780> feel<00:04:27.990> your<00:04:28.110> technique<00:04:28.500> grow

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
able to as you feel your technique grow

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.560 
able to as you feel your technique grow
you<00:04:28.800> want<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.130> be<00:04:29.340> able<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.640> listen<00:04:30.270> back<00:04:30.510> to

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
you want to be able to listen back to

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.480 
you want to be able to listen back to
something<00:04:30.990> you've<00:04:31.110> played<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.740> hear

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
something you've played and and hear

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.010 
something you've played and and hear
more<00:04:32.670> music<00:04:32.790> that's<00:04:33.180> there<00:04:33.390> you<00:04:33.570> know<00:04:33.720> you

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
more music that's there you know you

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.570 
more music that's there you know you
want<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.200> sort<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.680> like<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.980> say<00:04:35.130> sort<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.430> hear

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580

want to sort of like I say sort of hear
yourself<00:04:36.000> get<00:04:36.180> out<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.450> way<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:37.230> allow

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
yourself get out of the way and allow

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.190 
yourself get out of the way and allow
the<00:04:37.740> music<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.220> get<00:04:38.370> through<00:04:38.610> yeah<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.990> seems

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
the music to get through yeah it seems

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600 
the music to get through yeah it seems
like<00:04:40.290> most<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.770> pick<00:04:40.950> time<00:04:41.130> you're<00:04:41.310> doing

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
like most of the pick time you're doing

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.220 
like most of the pick time you're doing
alternate<00:04:42.060> picking<00:04:42.330> when<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> right<00:04:43.200> hand

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
alternate picking when the right hand

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.560 
alternate picking when the right hand
you<00:04:43.650> know<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.670> seems<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.120> always<00:04:45.390> down

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
you know it seems like it's always down

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.640 
you know it seems like it's always down
up<00:04:45.840> down<00:04:46.020> yeah

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
up down yeah

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.950 
up down yeah
when<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.250> do<00:04:47.730> get<00:04:47.970> into<00:04:48.150> an<00:04:48.300> alternating<00:04:48.660> thing

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
when I do get into an alternating thing

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.810 
when I do get into an alternating thing
I<00:04:48.990> rarely<00:04:51.740> deviate<00:04:52.740> from<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.980> but<00:04:53.400> but<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.700> do

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
I rarely deviate from that but but I do

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.270 
I rarely deviate from that but but I do
I'll<00:04:54.270> employ<00:04:54.930> some<00:04:55.170> sweep<00:04:55.410> things<00:04:55.620> sweep

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
I'll employ some sweep things sweep

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.190 
I'll employ some sweep things sweep
picking<00:04:56.520> every<00:04:56.880> now<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.090> again<00:04:57.120> which<00:04:57.450> which

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
picking every now and again which which

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.120 
picking every now and again which which
would<00:04:58.380> be<00:04:58.470> two<00:04:58.650> ups<00:05:02.120> so
