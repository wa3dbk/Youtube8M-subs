00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
need to need to clean out here for

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.610 
need to need to clean out here for
shooting<00:05:22.000> lanes<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.509> I<00:05:22.810> think<00:05:23.409> it's<00:05:23.530> gonna

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
shooting lanes that I think it's gonna

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.249 
shooting lanes that I think it's gonna
be<00:05:23.800> too<00:05:24.009> bad<00:05:24.190> now<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.699> I'm<00:05:24.819> in<00:05:24.970> here<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.360> think

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
be too bad now that I'm in here I think

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.620 
be too bad now that I'm in here I think
the<00:05:26.500> worst<00:05:26.680> parts<00:05:26.979> over<00:05:27.130> but<00:05:27.580> we'll<00:05:27.729> see<00:05:29.130> okay

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
the worst parts over but we'll see okay

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.129

here

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.190 

I<00:05:50.040> was<00:05:50.760> gonna<00:05:50.910> try<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.240> set<00:05:51.570> up<00:05:51.600> in<00:05:51.960> these

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
I was gonna try and set up in these

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.030 
I was gonna try and set up in these
trees<00:05:52.620> right<00:05:52.940> here<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:54.690> can<00:05:55.230> get<00:05:55.380> my<00:05:55.500> finger<00:05:55.920> in

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.950 
trees right here I can get my finger in
the<00:05:56.130> way<00:05:56.870> but<00:05:58.640> it<00:05:59.640> didn't<00:06:00.000> offer<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.540> benefit

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
the way but it didn't offer the benefit

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.950 
the way but it didn't offer the benefit
I<00:06:01.050> think<00:06:01.530> that<00:06:01.710> I'm<00:06:01.860> gonna<00:06:02.010> have<00:06:02.280> here<00:06:02.670> with

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.460 
I think that I'm gonna have here with
many<00:06:03.960> trails<00:06:04.290> as<00:06:04.470> I've<00:06:04.620> got<00:06:04.830> coming<00:06:05.190> in<00:06:06.470> you

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
many trails as I've got coming in you

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.780 
many trails as I've got coming in you
know<00:06:07.560> they<00:06:07.680> follow<00:06:07.950> that<00:06:08.190> right<00:06:08.430> on<00:06:08.610> up

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
know they follow that right on up

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.960 
know they follow that right on up
through<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:10.350> my<00:06:11.250> trail<00:06:11.550> cam<00:06:11.910> is<00:06:12.210> out<00:06:13.110> about

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
through and my trail cam is out about

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.920 
through and my trail cam is out about
maybe<00:06:14.970> 50<00:06:15.600> yards<00:06:15.900> 75<00:06:16.830> yards<00:06:17.780> straight<00:06:18.780> out
