00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
a base and catch fish is the catch best

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.880 
a base and catch fish is the catch best
actually<00:00:50.070> gets<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:51.559> felt<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.859> way

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually gets to felt all the way

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
actually gets to felt all the way
through<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> front<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> instead<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.019> all<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
through the front so instead of all the

through the front so instead of all the
way<00:01:01.289> through<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.679> just<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.129> right

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
way through it's just like this right
