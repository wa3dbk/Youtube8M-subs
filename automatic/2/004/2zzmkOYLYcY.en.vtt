 complicate the music I like 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.349
 I like good music let's do 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.610
 some roasted vegetables and the way that 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.340
 we make the remaining rhizome 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.230
 incredible so we have two types of 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.970
 vegetables like the media mi sevilla 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.840
 purple potato carrot potato sweet potato 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.739
 up here sweet as you want to call him 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.470
 different types that you 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.280
 find them finish with candy in the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.260
 secret advice salt in this case we have 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.030
 treat equal to already and garlic powder social 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.710
 and we also need olive oil and 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.710
 olive oil 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.309
 we peel the vegetables 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 two 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.870
 also if it's not going to stain everything 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.720
 Serbian 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.340
 white carrot 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.240
 the orange is the sister of the carrot 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.240
 white 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.810
 I also have a squash here 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.810
 shorten a good piece 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.140
 to 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.340
 let's grab the vegetable that we're going to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.569
 cook first which is the hardest 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.569
 we have the oven 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.790
 the chivas and the carrot goes together and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.690
 They are the hardest and the longest 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.690
 in cooking 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.980
 then we are going to agree on this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.980
 size 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.810
 once we have all the vegetables 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.620
 cut it apart because of how we're going to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.019
 bake if the carrot with the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.900
 to enter English with the little girl 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.170
 I wrote together because they are very hard 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.200
 then the sweet potato and the potato or the colony 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.750
 of potatoes or potatoes together because they are more 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.700
 or less similar if the violet the way 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.980
 Bake only little if it will not stain me 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.530
 all the food was going to stay all 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.569
 violet and pumpkin for being the most 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.610
 tender of all and also because stain 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.260
 let's leave alone or you could also go 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.930
 with the potatoes if for the time of 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.349
 cooking we grab a bowl apart and go 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.010
 to leave a cup olive oil 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.800
 this is good 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.660
 this 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.430
 we mix the olive oil with a 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.430
 good spoonful of paprika cotton 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.609
 paprika 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.950
 in the dry dow also a spoonful or 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.720
 you can put rosemary for example 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.440
 oregano because no but in the dow you 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.440
 it looks spectacular 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.140
 I'm going to spoonful of salt 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.950
 and half a tablespoon of garlic powder 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.940
 the spoonful 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.010
 our engine 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.980
 ok let's go through here then all 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.980
 vegetables 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.780
 we soak the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.630
 because I'm going to put a tray for him 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.630
 oven we ran a lot with the oil 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.199
 to 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.790
 the same thing I will do with the potato with 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.750
 the sweet potato 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.750
 but the oil 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.220
 let 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.320
 well now let's bake everything here 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.320
 we have the pumpkin 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.590
 hot 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.060
 at 150 degrees 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.400
 also those temperatures 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.300
 this is very big, you have to pay 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.070
 attention because there are things that come out 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:39.150
 first for example the praises and the 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.150
 downhill and downhill 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.469
 we put all 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.219
 to do 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.980
 I'm going back a little bit, half an hour 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.780
 some things like the pumpkin 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.780
 but still 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.060
 until it is well browned golden brown 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.460
 tastes to the black crust that barely 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.490
 it starts to go up there they go to 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.490
 to be 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.820
 Clear 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.460
 well now yes I forgot that I was 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:48.650
 making the dimension video baptized and 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.930
 donors the mature other friends 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.930
 then if what you have to do to 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.930
 puncture 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.990
 good durÃ¡n 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.310
 in what from one day to the other 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.020
 can eat can be put to heat 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.330
 Baked if you want or can make a 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.380
 good soup should be the quoted if 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:14.880
 there's no left over so good 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.880
 we see the next investment video 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.970
 I received development 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.639
 the potatoes that good 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.360
