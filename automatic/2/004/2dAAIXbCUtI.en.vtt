three<00:00:10.050> planes<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.470> motion<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.890> what<00:00:11.040> we're

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
three planes of motion is what we're

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.740 
three planes of motion is what we're
going<00:00:11.310> to<00:00:11.370> base<00:00:11.820> all<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.330> exercise

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
going to base all the exercise

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.299 
going to base all the exercise
applications<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:13.800> let<00:00:13.950> me<00:00:14.040> show<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
applications on so let me show you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.550 
applications on so let me show you
probably<00:00:15.300> the<00:00:15.480> most<00:00:15.660> basic<00:00:16.110> and<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
probably the most basic and this is the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
probably the most basic and this is the
one<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.890> most<00:00:17.010> people<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.430> grab<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.700> go<00:00:18.029> on

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
one that most people that grab and go on

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.940 
one that most people that grab and go on
this<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.360> this<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.230> most<00:00:19.410> people<00:00:19.740> do

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
this thing this is what most people do

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.990 
this thing this is what most people do
so<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.000> set<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.450> again<00:00:22.140> figure<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:23.000> your

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so you set up again figure out how your

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.850 
so you set up again figure out how your
body<00:00:24.270> relative<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.020> handles<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.680> then

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
body relative to the handles and then

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.679 
body relative to the handles and then
I'm<00:00:25.919> just<00:00:26.040> gonna<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.490> push<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.570> I'm

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
I'm just gonna do a push and then I'm

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.800 
I'm just gonna do a push and then I'm
going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.989> pull<00:00:28.259> push<00:00:28.800> pull<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:30.060> there's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
going to do a pull push pull now there's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
going to do a pull push pull now there's
two<00:00:31.110> things<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.950> can<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.120> emphasize

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
two things here I can really emphasize

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.530 
two things here I can really emphasize
my<00:00:33.840> core<00:00:34.200> by<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.340> putting<00:00:35.670> anybody<00:00:35.970> English

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
my core by not putting anybody English

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.960 
my core by not putting anybody English
in<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.380> body<00:00:37.680> sway<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.310> really

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
in it that's this body sway and really

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.020 
in it that's this body sway and really
just<00:00:39.149> focus<00:00:39.300> upper<00:00:39.960> body<00:00:40.550> that's<00:00:41.550> creating

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
just focus upper body that's creating

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
just focus upper body that's creating
core<00:00:42.300> stability<00:00:42.570> stiffness<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.250> looking

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
core stability stiffness so I'm looking

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.939 
core stability stiffness so I'm looking
at<00:00:44.640> core<00:00:44.910> transfer<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.620> getting<00:00:46.800> some

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
at core transfer so you're getting some

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.290 
at core transfer so you're getting some
cool<00:00:47.100> training<00:00:47.429> principles<00:00:47.609> out<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.120> DVD

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
cool training principles out of this DVD

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.110 
cool training principles out of this DVD
then<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> might<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.679> load<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.699> explode

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
then I might actually load and explode

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.319 
then I might actually load and explode
get<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> body<00:00:52.199> action<00:00:52.940> I'm<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.179> talk

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
get that body action I'm going to talk

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.259 
get that body action I'm going to talk
about<00:00:54.449> workout<00:00:54.929> density<00:00:55.969> getting<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.239> done

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
about workout density getting a lot done

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.540 
about workout density getting a lot done
a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.839> bit<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.079> time<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.890> many<00:00:59.070> things<00:00:59.339> do

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
a little bit of time how many things do

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.069 
a little bit of time how many things do
you<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:00.870> good

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you know that you could get a good

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.630 
you know that you could get a good
pushing<00:01:01.469> workout<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.339> can<00:01:02.550> do

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
pushing workout and if you can do

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
pushing workout and if you can do
pulling<00:01:02.969> workout<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> same<00:01:03.899> exercise

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
pulling workout do the same exercise

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
pulling workout do the same exercise
that's<00:01:04.980> what<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.220> talking<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.750> if

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that's what we're talking about here if

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.350 
that's what we're talking about here if
you<00:01:06.840> rest<00:01:07.050> inside<00:01:09.920> let's<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.360> alternate

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you rest inside let's do these alternate

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
you rest inside let's do these alternate
arm<00:01:12.510> punches<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.010> eight

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
arm punches so I'm going to go eight

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
arm punches so I'm going to go eight
seconds<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.970> hard<00:01:15.480> and<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.870> fast<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
seconds as hard and as fast as I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.569 
seconds as hard and as fast as I
possibly<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.730> here<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.270> go

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.179 

so<00:01:25.579> that<00:01:26.479> would<00:01:26.600> be<00:01:26.630> power<00:01:26.960> endurance<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.740> don't

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
so that would be power endurance I don't

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.920 
so that would be power endurance I don't
want<00:01:28.340> my<00:01:28.460> athletes<00:01:28.880> or<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:29.180> clients<00:01:29.600> thinking

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
want my athletes or my clients thinking

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.319 
want my athletes or my clients thinking
about<00:01:30.310> repetitions<00:01:31.310> all<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:31.880> want<00:01:32.180> them<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
about repetitions all I want them to

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.529 
about repetitions all I want them to
think<00:01:32.479> about<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:33.310> getting<00:01:34.310> after<00:01:34.579> it<00:01:34.820> go<00:01:35.240> hard

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
think about is getting after it go hard

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.039 
think about is getting after it go hard
go<00:01:35.780> fast<00:01:36.530> now<00:01:37.039> how<00:01:37.850> do<00:01:37.909> I<00:01:38.030> know<00:01:38.149> they're<00:01:38.810> going

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
go fast now how do I know they're going

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.260 
go fast now how do I know they're going
hard<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.619> they're<00:01:39.920> going<00:01:40.130> fast<00:01:40.399> this<00:01:41.090> is

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
hard and they're going fast this is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.520 
hard and they're going fast this is
something<00:01:41.509> that's<00:01:41.570> very<00:01:41.750> very<00:01:41.869> important<00:01:42.409> and

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
people can try to dog it if you know

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.660 
people can try to dog it if you know
what<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.409> mean<00:01:49.000> these<00:01:51.250> right<00:01:52.250> here

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
those help me coach because if I don't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.130 
those help me coach because if I don't
hear<00:01:55.789> loud<00:01:56.720> noises<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:58.209> know<00:01:59.209> no<00:01:59.509> powers<00:01:59.959> going

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
hear loud noises I know no powers going

hear loud noises I know no powers going
in<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.470> out<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.740> thing<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.250> they<00:02:02.030> go<00:02:02.179> down

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
in and out of this thing so they go down

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.179 
in and out of this thing so they go down
I'm<00:02:02.509> trying<00:02:02.720> too<00:02:02.780> hard<00:02:02.810> they<00:02:03.110> don't<00:02:03.979> try<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
I'm trying too hard they don't try the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.340 
I'm trying too hard they don't try the
hard<00:02:04.429> thing<00:02:04.580> though<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:04.759> thought<00:02:05.200> make<00:02:06.200> it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
hard thing though I thought make it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.710 
hard thing though I thought make it
