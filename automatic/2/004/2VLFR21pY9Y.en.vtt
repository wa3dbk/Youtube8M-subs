00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
they would have been thinking that way

they would have been thinking that way
how<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> prepare<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.920> penalty<00:00:20.310> shooter

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640

the<00:00:22.500> years<00:00:22.650> yeah<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.189> course<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.640> mean<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the years yeah of course I mean now the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.849 
the years yeah of course I mean now the
technologies<00:00:24.689> come<00:00:24.960> into<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.529> normally

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
technologies come into it so normally

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
technologies come into it so normally
11i<00:00:26.310> fat<00:00:26.550> or<00:00:26.699> something<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> nature<00:00:27.240> on

11i fat or something of that nature on

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
11i fat or something of that nature on
the<00:00:27.840> bench<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> you'll<00:00:28.980> try<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.460> all

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the bench and and you'll try to get all

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.370 
the bench and and you'll try to get all
the<00:00:29.730> data<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.359> possibly<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:31.080> now

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the data that you can possibly get now

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
the data that you can possibly get now
in<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> shootout<00:00:32.009> sometimes<00:00:32.669> you're<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:32.880> gonna

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
in a shootout sometimes you're not gonna

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.690 
in a shootout sometimes you're not gonna
see<00:00:33.360> anything<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:33.960> maybe<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.550> or

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
see anything from maybe that of two or

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430 
see anything from maybe that of two or
three<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.940> maybe<00:00:36.180> even<00:00:36.329> four<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> penalty

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
three or maybe even four of the penalty

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
three or maybe even four of the penalty
takers<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.160> you'll<00:00:38.309> try<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.910> much

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
takers but you'll try to get as much

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.049 
takers but you'll try to get as much
data<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.600> possible<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.940> override<00:00:41.940> your

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
data as possible but that override your

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
data as possible but that override your
instinct<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.660> trust<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> go<00:00:43.710> no<00:00:44.070> from<00:00:44.309> me<00:00:44.430> no

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
instinct and trust you go no from me no

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.029 
instinct and trust you go no from me no
but<00:00:45.450> again<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.200> younger<00:00:46.590> yeah<00:00:46.800> probably

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
but again if I was younger yeah probably

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
but again if I was younger yeah probably
but<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.640> I've<00:00:47.820> gotten<00:00:48.000> older<00:00:48.210> there's<00:00:48.899> little

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
but as I've gotten older there's little

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
but as I've gotten older there's little
things<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> tried<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> detect<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.579> mean

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
things that you tried to detect I mean

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
things that you tried to detect I mean
the<00:00:51.030> best<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.480> me<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.079> always<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.559> try<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the best one for me was always to try to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
the best one for me was always to try to
detect<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.489> planning<00:00:53.879> foot<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.750> more

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
detect the planning foot now is more

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
detect the planning foot now is more
difficult<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.770> age<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.219> I've<00:00:56.430> gotten

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
difficult at my age and as I've gotten

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.099 
difficult at my age and as I've gotten
older<00:00:56.820> because<00:00:57.329> you're<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.780> bit<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
older because you're a little bit a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.080 
older because you're a little bit a
little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.620> slower<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> feet<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
little bit slower on the feet and you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.729 
little bit slower on the feet and you
have<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.480> you're<00:01:00.629> waiting<00:01:00.870> till<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.350> last

have to if you're waiting till that last

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
have to if you're waiting till that last
second<00:01:02.280> before<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.760> move<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
second before you move you have to be

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750 
second before you move you have to be
really<00:01:04.350> quick<00:01:04.619> really<00:01:05.100> powerful<00:01:05.250> really

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it's instinct there's other things that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's instinct there's other things that
you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.090> detect<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.600> long's<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.049> run<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.350> how

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you can detect how long's to run up how

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
you can detect how long's to run up how
shorts<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> run<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.640> angle<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> run-up

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
shorts to run up the angle of the run-up

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.590 
shorts to run up the angle of the run-up
how<00:01:22.200> big<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> occasion<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.939> instinct<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
how big is the occasion my instinct is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
how big is the occasion my instinct is
is<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> bigger<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> game<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
run up and start again and I remember

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.940 
run up and start again and I remember
going<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.510> threw<00:03:28.810> me<00:03:28.989> completely<00:03:29.530> and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
going like you threw me completely and

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.160 
going like you threw me completely and
as<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.160> write<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.790> get<00:03:30.940> get<00:03:31.720> back<00:03:31.989> on

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
as I write I have to get get back on

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.410 
as I write I have to get get back on
song<00:03:32.440> here<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.980> focus<00:03:33.700> again<00:03:33.970> but<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.299> is

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
song here and focus again but it is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.390 
song here and focus again but it is
typical<00:03:34.840> because<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.920> walk<00:03:36.100> from

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
typical because you that the walk from

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.729 
typical because you that the walk from
the<00:03:36.549> halfway<00:03:36.910> line<00:03:37.090> up<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.500> might

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
the halfway line up like it you might

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.670 
the halfway line up like it you might
only<00:03:38.920> be<00:03:39.069> twenty<00:03:39.970> or<00:03:40.060> thirty<00:03:40.239> seconds<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.019> so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
only be twenty or thirty seconds but so

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.870 
only be twenty or thirty seconds but so
much<00:03:41.950> has<00:03:41.980> gone<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.370> your<00:03:42.519> head<00:03:42.670> at<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
much has gone on in your head at the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.340 
much has gone on in your head at the
time<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.359> do<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.510> still<00:03:43.569> think<00:03:43.720> it's<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.109> I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
time so do you still think it's the I

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.660 
time so do you still think it's the I
mean<00:03:44.500> it's<00:03:44.620> great<00:03:44.859> television<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.459> to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
mean it's great television you have to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.280 
mean it's great television you have to
say<00:03:45.850> but<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.329> it<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> right<00:03:46.630> way<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> finish<00:03:47.170> of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
say but is it the right way to finish of

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.009 
say but is it the right way to finish of
course<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.799> actually<00:03:48.250> mental<00:03:48.870> games<00:03:49.870> an

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
course it is actually mental games an

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.059 
course it is actually mental games an
hour<00:03:50.139> and<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> half<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.590> would<00:03:50.709> score<00:03:50.950> each

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
hour and a half to I would score each

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.289 
hour and a half to I would score each
other<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.430> they<00:03:51.549> don't<00:03:51.730> give<00:03:52.060> them<00:03:52.150> another

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
other and they don't give them another

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.750 
other and they don't give them another
half<00:03:52.569> hour<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.959> they<00:03:53.230> don't<00:03:53.579> what's<00:03:54.579> the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
half hour and they don't what's the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.259 
half hour and they don't what's the
other<00:03:54.819> option

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
other option

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.520 
other option
but<00:03:55.540> can<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.720> not<00:03:55.810> see<00:03:55.989> with<00:03:56.109> twenty<00:03:56.319> minutes

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
but can you not see with twenty minutes

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.110 
but can you not see with twenty minutes
to<00:03:56.590> go<00:03:56.709> oh<00:03:56.739> yes<00:03:57.040> two<00:03:57.190> teams<00:03:57.850> are<00:03:58.000> already

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
to go oh yes two teams are already

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.849 
to go oh yes two teams are already
beginning<00:03:58.480> before<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.170> extra<00:03:59.470> time<00:03:59.650> but

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
beginning before the extra time but

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.020 
beginning before the extra time but
we're<00:03:59.980> probably<00:04:00.310> already<00:04:00.430> getting<00:04:00.790> into<00:04:00.940> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
we're probably already getting into the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.300 
we're probably already getting into the
mindset<00:04:01.359> of<00:04:01.510> penalties<00:04:02.410> yeah<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.709> think<00:04:02.829> it<00:04:03.130> was

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
mindset of penalties yeah I think it was

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.640 
mindset of penalties yeah I think it was
even<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.850> fear<00:04:04.030> especially<00:04:04.540> an<00:04:05.109> extra<00:04:05.470> time

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
even the fear especially an extra time

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.410 
even the fear especially an extra time
because<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.489> goalkeepers<00:04:07.060> they<00:04:07.180> stopped

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
because the the goalkeepers they stopped

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.940 
because the the goalkeepers they stopped
both<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.989> them<00:04:08.079> stopped<00:04:08.290> playing<00:04:08.560> out<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.889> the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
both of them stopped playing out of the

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.830 
both of them stopped playing out of the
back<00:04:09.130> completely<00:04:09.430> neither<00:04:10.269> of<00:04:10.450> them<00:04:10.540> wanted

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
back completely neither of them wanted

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.479 
back completely neither of them wanted
to<00:04:10.900> make<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.109> mistake<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.709> think<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.069> came<00:04:12.280> into

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
to make a mistake I think that came into

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.819 
to make a mistake I think that came into
play<00:04:12.639> with<00:04:13.030> how<00:04:13.269> well<00:04:13.569> Chile<00:04:14.019> was<00:04:14.260> pressing<00:04:14.680> as

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
play with how well Chile was pressing as

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.190 
play with how well Chile was pressing as
well<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.250> how<00:04:15.760> well<00:04:16.000> Brazil<00:04:16.479> was<00:04:16.810> pressing

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
well and how well Brazil was pressing

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.330 
well and how well Brazil was pressing
against<00:04:17.410> Chile<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:17.859> they<00:04:17.979> didn't<00:04:18.160> want<00:04:18.190> to

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
against Chile so they didn't want to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.909 
against Chile so they didn't want to
make<00:04:18.430> mistakes<00:04:18.700> but<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.120> almost<00:04:19.389> with<00:04:19.570> about

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
make mistakes but it almost with about

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.320 
make mistakes but it almost with about
five<00:04:20.919> minutes<00:04:21.159> into<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.549> first<00:04:21.700> extra<00:04:22.120> time

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
five minutes into the first extra time

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.060 
five minutes into the first extra time
it<00:04:22.539> seemed<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:22.750> both<00:04:23.140> teams<00:04:23.440> were<00:04:23.650> happy<00:04:23.950> to

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
it seemed like both teams were happy to

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:36.940 
it seemed like both teams were happy to
go<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.250> panel

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.010 

you
