with the obvious I'm not Jurgen
Klinsmann<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.389> don't<00:00:12.809> have<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.019> goals<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.710> don't

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
Klinsmann I don't have the goals I don't

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
Klinsmann I don't have the goals I don't
have<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> metals<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.509> don't<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
have the metals and I don't have a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
have the metals and I don't have a
contract<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.379> lead<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> u.s.<00:00:16.920> through<00:00:17.550> Russia

and thus it follows that I won't be the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.040 
and thus it follows that I won't be the
