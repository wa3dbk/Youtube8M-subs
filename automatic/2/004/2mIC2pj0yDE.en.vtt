used copper wire another plug and a cup

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
used copper wire another plug and a cup
this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:20.010> not<00:00:20.279> really<00:00:20.640> necessary<00:00:23.720> I've

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
this is not really necessary I've

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.359 
this is not really necessary I've
actually<00:00:25.019> made<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.470> won't<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:29.010> able<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
actually made it so you won't be able to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.560 
actually made it so you won't be able to
see<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> process<00:00:30.289> but<00:00:32.719> it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> fairly<00:00:34.140> easy

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
see the process but it's a fairly easy

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.850 
see the process but it's a fairly easy
experiment<00:00:38.120> I'll<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.050> put<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.739> on

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
experiment I'll just you know put it on

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
experiment I'll just you know put it on
it's<00:00:41.100> already<00:00:43.579> it's<00:00:44.579> already<00:00:44.730> been<00:00:45.210> finished

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's already it's already been finished

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.760 
it's already it's already been finished
so<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.370> work<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:49.280> mean<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> just

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
so it will it will work I mean you just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.310 

yeah<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.680> removed<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:12.080> four<00:01:13.080> moves

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
yeah it is what I removed in four moves

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:31.540 
yeah it is what I removed in four moves
from<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.740> big<00:01:13.980> magnet<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:15.750> still<00:01:16.470> works

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.670 

this<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.270> where<00:01:32.480> this<00:01:32.660> home<00:01:32.840> comes<00:01:33.080> from<00:01:33.440> so
