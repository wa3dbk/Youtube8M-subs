00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
would any other type of a bulb wait till

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.989 
would any other type of a bulb wait till
the<00:01:38.939> tops<00:01:39.179> frost<00:01:39.630> down<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:39.959> little<00:01:40.409> bit<00:01:40.999> after

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.489 
bulb before the ground actually freezes

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.050 
bulb before the ground actually freezes
just<00:01:50.489> go<00:01:50.639> ahead<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.060> store<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:53.060> Dahlia

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
just go ahead and store it like a Dahlia

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.569 
just go ahead and store it like a Dahlia
tuber<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.599> that<00:01:54.779> let<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> soil<00:01:55.979> kind<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> dry
