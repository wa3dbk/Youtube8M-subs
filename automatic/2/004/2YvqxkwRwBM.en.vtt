the test but anyway let's see how well
of<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.729> edge<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.689> put<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.579> we'll<00:01:41.729> see

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
of a edge I put on it and then we'll see

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.249 
of a edge I put on it and then we'll see
if<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.060> retains<00:01:42.390> any<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.840> edge

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.120 

yeah<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.579> cut<00:01:51.850> through<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.320> let's<00:01:53.530> he<00:01:53.649> see

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
yeah it cut through it so let's he see

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
yeah it cut through it so let's he see
how<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.399> does<00:01:54.549> with<00:01:54.729> some<00:01:54.969> weather<00:01:55.119> here

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560 

all<00:02:05.070> right<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.610> we're<00:02:06.090> gonna<00:02:06.180> try<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
all right so we're gonna try this a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.720 
all right so we're gonna try this a
different<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:15.590> yeah<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:17.040> did<00:02:17.220> cut<00:02:17.489> through

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
different way yeah you did cut through

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.600 
different way yeah you did cut through
the<00:02:17.849> leather<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.099> lot<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.489> is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the leather and I think a lot of that is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.400 
the leather and I think a lot of that is
just<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.330> knife<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.080> lightweight

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
just this this knife is so lightweight

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.259 
just this this knife is so lightweight
it's<00:02:25.800> really<00:02:26.069> hard<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.370> drive<00:02:26.640> very<00:02:26.819> far<00:02:27.120> into

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
it's really hard to drive very far into

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:27.650 
it's really hard to drive very far into
here

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
here

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.400 
here
especially<00:02:28.620> with<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.340> tanto<00:02:29.760> point<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:31.380> just

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
especially with this tanto point it just

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.300 
especially with this tanto point it just
doesn't<00:02:31.830> want<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.130> grab<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> hold<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:34.310> let's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
doesn't want to grab a hold there let's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.620 
doesn't want to grab a hold there let's
see<00:02:35.459> how<00:02:35.580> well<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.790> does<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.120> some<00:02:36.239> chopping

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
see how well it does with some chopping

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.750 
see how well it does with some chopping
I'm<00:02:36.810> honestly<00:02:37.440> I'm<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.709> expecting<00:02:38.190> much<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
I'm honestly I'm not expecting much the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.970 
I'm honestly I'm not expecting much the
knife<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.360> lightweight<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.410> don't<00:02:40.860> know

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
knife is so lightweight I I don't know

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.300 
knife is so lightweight I I don't know
what<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.280> expect<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:42.769> one<00:02:43.769> problem<00:02:44.160> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
what to expect here we go one problem is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.229 
what to expect here we go one problem is
being<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.709> edge<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:47.640> pretty<00:02:48.030> much<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
being that this edge is pretty much a

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.210 
being that this edge is pretty much a
double<00:02:48.600> edge<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.709> can't<00:02:49.890> put<00:02:49.950> any

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
double edge you really can't put any

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.800 
double edge you really can't put any
weight<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.060> backside<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:51.599> there<00:02:51.720> with

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
weight on the backside are there with

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.150 
weight on the backside are there with
your<00:02:51.930> hand<00:02:52.110> or<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.500> would<00:02:52.650> definitely<00:02:52.769> slice

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
your hand or you would definitely slice

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.259 
your hand or you would definitely slice
yourself<00:02:53.310> open<00:02:55.519> that's<00:02:56.519> something<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> need

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
yourself open that's something you need

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.789 
yourself open that's something you need
to<00:02:57.330> pay<00:02:57.480> attention<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.440> using<00:02:58.620> this

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
to pay attention to if you're using this

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.289 
to pay attention to if you're using this
knife<00:02:59.040> for<00:02:59.370> sure<00:02:59.670> as<00:03:00.540> far<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:00.890> tinder<00:03:01.890> goes<00:03:02.299> it

does okay as good as to be expected I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.780 
does okay as good as to be expected I
suppose<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.769> obviously<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.980> splits<00:03:08.310> small

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
suppose and obviously it splits small

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.090 
suppose and obviously it splits small
kindling<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.420> fine<00:03:12.560> see<00:03:13.560> how<00:03:13.709> well<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.070> does

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
well it kept its edge though just to

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.270 
well it kept its edge though just to
check<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.209> out<00:03:57.740> so<00:03:58.740> let's<00:03:58.920> try<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.130> out

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
check that out so let's try it out

so<00:04:28.819> I<00:04:28.849> did<00:04:29.060> make<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.270> through<00:04:29.389> there

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
so I did make it through there

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.930 
so I did make it through there
eventually

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.360 

I<00:04:36.030> don't<00:04:36.630> know<00:04:36.720> if<00:04:36.810> that's<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.250> testament<00:04:38.250> to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
I don't know if that's a testament to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.120 
I don't know if that's a testament to
the<00:04:38.670> knife<00:04:39.140> having<00:04:40.140> lack<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.590> ability<00:04:40.740> there

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
the knife having lack of ability there

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.800 
the knife having lack of ability there
or<00:04:41.310> my<00:04:41.460> lack<00:04:41.700> of<00:04:41.880> being<00:04:42.030> able<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.300> sharpen<00:04:42.540> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
or my lack of being able to sharpen the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.600 
or my lack of being able to sharpen the
knife<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.230> would<00:04:43.530> say<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.920> it<00:04:44.040> lost<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.460> little

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
knife I would say that it lost a little

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.450 
knife I would say that it lost a little
bit<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.820> its<00:04:45.000> edge<00:04:45.800> seemed<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.950> little<00:04:47.160> tougher

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
bit of its edge seemed a little tougher

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.200 
bit of its edge seemed a little tougher
with<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:48.360> parachute<00:04:48.930> cord<00:04:49.170> to<00:04:49.320> get<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.560> going

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
with the parachute cord to get it going

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.520 
with the parachute cord to get it going
and<00:04:51.440> really<00:04:52.440> didn't<00:04:52.830> do<00:04:53.010> a<00:04:53.690> horrible<00:04:54.690> job<00:04:54.810> but

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
and really didn't do a horrible job but

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.280 
and really didn't do a horrible job but
it<00:04:55.980> definitely<00:04:56.970> did<00:04:57.090> not<00:04:57.120> do<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> great<00:04:58.110> job

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
it definitely did not do a great job

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.190 
it definitely did not do a great job
either<00:04:58.530> so<00:04:59.460> as<00:05:00.180> far<00:05:00.480> as<00:05:00.660> some<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.020> good

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
either so as far as some of the good

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.930 
either so as far as some of the good
things<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.620> really<00:05:01.950> like<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.280> titanium<00:05:02.730> blade

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
things I really like the titanium blade

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.120 
things I really like the titanium blade
I<00:05:02.970> again<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.690> like<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.290> idea<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.710> being<00:05:04.920> able<00:05:05.040> to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
I again I like the idea of being able to

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.770 
I again I like the idea of being able to
put<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.430> away<00:05:05.520> a<00:05:05.610> little<00:05:05.820> bit<00:05:05.910> wet<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.420> not

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
put it away a little bit wet and not

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.780 
put it away a little bit wet and not
have<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.050> worry<00:05:07.230> about<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.590> also<00:05:08.490> the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
have to worry about it also the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.690 
have to worry about it also the
retention<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.080> sheath<00:05:10.290> is<00:05:10.590> really<00:05:11.550> good

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
retention in the sheath is really good

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
retention in the sheath is really good
you're<00:05:11.850> not<00:05:11.940> getting<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.330> out<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.540> there

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
you're not getting that out of there

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.290 
you're not getting that out of there
unless<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.080> mean<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.610> now<00:05:14.610> as<00:05:14.730> far<00:05:14.880> as<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.120> bad

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
unless you mean to now as far as the bad

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.910 
unless you mean to now as far as the bad
goes<00:05:15.540> well<00:05:15.960> quite<00:05:16.200> frankly<00:05:16.230> this<00:05:16.710> is

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
goes well quite frankly this is

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.760 
goes well quite frankly this is
definitely<00:05:17.280> not<00:05:17.670> a<00:05:18.000> camping<00:05:18.690> hiking<00:05:19.110> survival
