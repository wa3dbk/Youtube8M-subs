00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.060
 I explain you step by step how 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.300
 it is possible world in singleplayer too 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.559

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.509

 tutorial today we do not want that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.550
 budget plugin world which us 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.109
 allows very large areas too 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 change and generally the world altogether 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.730
 easy and above all much faster than 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 edit suter block for block no 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 we do not want the whole thing on one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.990
 In this case, servers should be single 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
 install player and that's what we are for 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.010
 to find the description now 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.230
 we go down a bit here 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.790
 to be exact, even pretty far 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.590
 down to downloads and there we have 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 now minecraft 1 point 7.10 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.850
 and now we do not take it with us 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 the leader but with fortune ours 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 minecraft on 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.360
 for that we click here now on the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.530
 download with progresses to the right 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.789
 There is also a bit hidden now 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.230
 a download button we click 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.210
 now and then on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.770
 keep and make us world the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 Continuation downloaded 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.309
 but he hears briskly we need 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 that's why we go to files 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.149
 point manko fomc point nice and load 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.519
 us there for the version 1.7 point 10 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.409
 forge down with the installer windows 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.119
 also there we have to be very short at about 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 Wait for the advertising and then in the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.600
 connection again very briefly on the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 real of the dollar click yes that can 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 We confirm and then we click 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.509
 very short with the choice of instore 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.119
 client to the right file drive on 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 ok and now through the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.880
 Installation Assistant has us now 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.990
 already installed the profile and we 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 Look, if the whole thing really 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 had worked 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.470
 for that we open our minecraft 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 launcher sometimes comes this 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.619
 error message because we can but easy 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.119
 say yes the program was right 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.290
 installed there is no error at all 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.420
 and now let us guess 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.820
 minecraft at this point would have to now 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 under edit profile at the very bottom the version 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 1.7 select point 10 from ford and then 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.820
 press on play and now we are here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 in version 1.7 point 10 and above 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.149
 all we have a mods folder and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 This is the indicator of progress 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.299
 that means that we also got one 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.829
 created mods folder and therefore 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.689
 Now we press windows button and he 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.399
 and execute in the appearances 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.040
 dialogue window we give now percent 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.780
 abb data percent go into point 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.850
 minecraft and there we find the now 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 mods folder and in this folder belongs 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.750
 who would have thought it now world edit 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.849
 the fortune in now we can 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.970
 minecraft will start again 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.170
 take care that she chooses the 1.794 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 and is this now 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 tann and we have in mods folder world 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.430
 then we can finish the whole 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.590
 of course also in the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.849
 try singleplayer for it 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.020
 here we just a world and 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.790
 For example, write one of the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.040
 most important world come and that he 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.110
 oblique shrill oblique oblique band around 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.520
 here in this case, such an ax too 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.530
 We will then get our region 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.880
 You can choose more about the functions 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.989
 however, world ends in the right 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.370
 linked video above 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.500
 if you still want to know how it works 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.670
 it is possible to change minecraft biome 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.810
 then just click into that 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.000
