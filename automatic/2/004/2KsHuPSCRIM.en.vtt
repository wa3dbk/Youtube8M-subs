when<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:49.280> printed<00:00:49.760> things<00:00:50.059> with<00:00:50.390> my<00:00:50.540> computer

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
when I printed things with my computer

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.400 
when I printed things with my computer
it<00:00:51.469> actually<00:00:52.149> seemed<00:00:53.149> like<00:00:53.360> music<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.960> me<00:00:54.110> I

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
it actually seemed like music to me I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.619 
it actually seemed like music to me I
just<00:00:55.100> wanted<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.550> make<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:58.120> sound<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.300> bit<00:00:59.329> more

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
just wanted to make it sound a bit more

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:00.910 
just wanted to make it sound a bit more
like<00:00:59.690> music<00:01:00.350> than<00:01:00.530> when<00:01:00.739> you're<00:01:00.890> just

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
like music than when you're just

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.090 
like music than when you're just
printing<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.140> other<00:01:03.140> people<00:01:03.590> could<00:01:03.829> see

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
printing so that other people could see

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:52.750 
printing so that other people could see
that

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.490 

what<00:01:53.760> I<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.180> done<00:01:54.480> is<00:01:54.690> I've<00:01:54.870> done<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
what I have done is I've done a lot of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.270 
what I have done is I've done a lot of
experiments<00:01:56.370> trying<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.000> achieve<00:01:57.630> different

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
experiments trying to achieve different

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.010 
experiments trying to achieve different
pitchman<00:01:59.280> Lia<00:01:59.580> there's<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.330> very<00:02:00.630> limited

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
pitchman Lia there's a very limited

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.180 
pitchman Lia there's a very limited
range<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.710> pitch<00:02:02.010> coming<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.270> printer

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
range of pitch coming out of the printer

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.040 
range of pitch coming out of the printer
and<00:02:05.190> I've<00:02:05.640> experimented<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.480> different

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
and I've experimented with different

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.580 
and I've experimented with different
rows<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.130> different<00:02:08.520> characters<00:02:09.210> and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
rows of different characters and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
rows of different characters and
different<00:02:10.610> densities<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> gray<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:15.450> have

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
different densities of gray and I I have

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680 
different densities of gray and I I have
tried<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.860> quite<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> bit<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.460> control<00:02:17.970> but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
tried to get quite a bit of control but

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.040 
tried to get quite a bit of control but
I<00:02:18.960> wasn't<00:02:19.470> totally<00:02:20.430> happy<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.480> results

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
I wasn't totally happy with the results

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.850 
I wasn't totally happy with the results
of<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.580> it's<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.790> mixture<00:02:24.240> of<00:02:25.850> control<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
of that it's a mixture of control and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:03:05.030 
of that it's a mixture of control and
good<00:02:28.860> luck

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:40.929 

I<00:03:37.099> think<00:03:38.099> what<00:03:38.310> captured<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:39.000> interest<00:03:39.299> with

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
I think what captured my interest with

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.240 
I think what captured my interest with
bicycling<00:03:41.939> rhythms<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:43.200> hearing<00:03:43.439> changing

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
bicycling rhythms I was hearing changing

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.869 
bicycling rhythms I was hearing changing
rhythms<00:03:44.930> complex<00:03:45.930> rhythms<00:03:46.889> interacting<00:03:47.760> with

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
rhythms complex rhythms interacting with

00:03:47.879 --> 00:04:57.290 
rhythms complex rhythms interacting with
each<00:03:48.000> other

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.570 

yeah<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.360> want<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.990> record<00:04:59.500> stuff<00:04:59.860> all<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.310> time

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
yeah I want to record stuff all the time

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.650 
yeah I want to record stuff all the time
I<00:05:00.610> still<00:05:01.030> haven't<00:05:01.450> gotten<00:05:01.720> equipment

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.660 

everything
