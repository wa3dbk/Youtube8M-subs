00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.200
I knew that Jay was a true friend when as
a gift he gave me a mangroomer, which is an

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.200
extendable arm back shaver. I used it in preparation
for tonight. Anyone who wants to inspect is

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.450
free. None but a true friend could be so thoughtful,
considerate and honest about your faults.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.869
In our group of guy friends, we express our
affection by ruthlessly making fun of each

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.410
other. Tonight I get to show a little affection
for Jay.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.780
I remember a few summers ago when I visited
Jay in Pittsburgh. He was still settling in

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.780
and he didn't know many people. He was a bit
lonely without his old pals and family. Like

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.199
typical women, we talked over ice cream about
how Jay thought he would never find a spouse

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.280
in Pittsburgh. At that time, me and the guys
thought that no one would ever accept Jay

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.280
for who he is and that we'd have to do a major
crisis intervention around age 48 to overhaul

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.359
his personality to make him more suitable
to women.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.700
Fast forward to the Era of Amy, as I like
to call it.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.700
Here are some select quotes from a March 2008
conversation I had with Jay. The first conversation

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.470
he and I ever had about Amy.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.270
We just took bites of each other's food (Bride
shouts, Oh my God!) . . .

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.270
We just took bites of each other's food like
it was family. To me that is sort of cool

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.540
because that says a lot about how comfortable
you are with someone.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.100
Apparently making jokes like normal does the
trick with this one

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.120
My only complaint so far is that she's a texter
rather than a talker on the phone.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.180
(The father has the same complaint)

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.180
But honestly, she's the type of girl I could
see myself married to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.730
Every girl I've ever kissed has stopped in
the middle to tell me they thought I was an

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.780
awesome kisser . . . except this girl. So
perhaps that is a bad omen.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.030
(As a side note, and this comes from Josh,
if a girl stops in the middle of kissing to

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.740
chat, you might not actually be that awesome
of a kisser.)

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.350
She's the elusive one we've talked about

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.569
She told me I make her the happiest anyone
has ever made her

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.250
I mean, it's not like we're getting married
tomorrow

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.550
Oh, and she loves Chicago. Goodnight man.
Go Cubbies Tomorrow.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.850
Jay used to do this really annoying thing.
He would touch and grab his guy friends all

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.850
the time. A couple of times, I flipped out
on him, put him in a chokehold, made him bleed.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.180
Me and the guys starting thinking that uhhh
maybe Jay was trying to tell us something.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.660
But fortunately all of this stopped once Amy
came into the picture. Thank you Amy for being

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.730
a beautiful and appropriate outlet for Mr.
Grabby hands over here.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.730
I learned around May 2009 that Jay purchased
a ring and was considering asking Amy to marry

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.240
him. Before having even met Amy, I wrote an
email to him in May 2009, "Do not get married.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.640
You have to test her out for at least 2 more
years. Please, please, please do not make

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.640
that big of a decision. We're still young.
Don't panic. Be calm. Be cool. Don't let her

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.780
control your thoughts. Don't let her convince
you that marriage must be the next step and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.599
that you must take that step soon. They make
us think about maturity and responsibility

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.599
and children and it's all miserable."
Again, at this point, I had not yet even met

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.400
Amy. Jason assured me that I would have no
reservations upon meeting her.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.949
So, the first time I met Amy I go over to
Jay's family's house in Chicago. I walk in

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.719
the front door and before I can take my shoes
off she pops out from around the corner and

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.249
gives me the warmest guerrilla attack Grizzly
Bear hug I've ever received. If you've never

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:40.249
had the pleasure of an Amy hug, she squeezes
you to the breaking point but in a loving

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.340
and in a genuine way. From that moment, I
have adored Amy and have abandoned all reservations

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.749
about their marriage. That hug was more eloquent
and more persuasive than Amy's or Jay's words

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:02.749
could have ever been as to why she is qualified
to steal away my Jason. So Amy, you had me

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.029
at hug.

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:12.029
It's the kind of hug you want to feel from
your wife. It's the kind of hug you want your

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.930
wife to give your mother, your father, your
sisters, your friends, your aunts, your uncles,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.300
your grandmother and even someday your own
children. Jay, I am sorry for ever doubting

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.069
your decision before even meeting the bride-to-be.
She is without question the right choice.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.719
Jay and I have a great group of guy friends.
I'm speaking mostly to the guys in the room

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.879
here. You know when your buddy marries a girl
that's just not acceptable? None of your guy

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:41.759
friends can stand her? I'm sure you are
nervously looking around the room right now.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:47.830
We aren't gonna have that problem with Amy.
She fits into our crew of guys as though she

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.300
was a member from the beginning. Amy is a
blessing to us and to Jay. She understands

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.300
our humor. She loves us with as much warmth
as she loves her own friends and I think I

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.110
speak for all the guys when I say that we
return that love.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.869
She also fits in so well with the crazy, fun,
light hearted Eisenhauer family that if you

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:09.619
didn't know their last names, you might think
that Jay is marrying into the Eisenhauer family

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.279
today, rather than Amy.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:19.619
About six months ago, my Mother was lecturing
me on her hope that I will get married someday.

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:24.599
I asked her to name one married couple that
is not miserable together. She promptly said,

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.789
"Jason and Amy." Of course six months ago
they weren't married but here's hoping that

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.139
my mother is as good a fortune teller as she
is a mother.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:37.139
I know I speak for all of the groomsmen when
I say that Jay you're a once in a lifetime

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.439
kind of friend. I know that we'll be the
closest of friends for our entire lives. You're

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:48.059
the kind of friend that I'd want at my side
in a fight or in any sort of situation. Good

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:53.039
times, bad times, anything. We all love you.

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.219
I hope that everyone in this room has already
or will someday meet a person to build a Love

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:55.520
as sincere as the one we witness today between
Jay and Amy. Some could wander the earth for

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.479
a thousand years before finding a Love as
strong as the one you have here.

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:02.589
I Love you both and know your best days stretch
before you.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.399
This is the best man speech delivered to Jay
and Amy Eisenhauer on their September 4, 2010

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:04.809
wedding. They found Love. Congrats guys. Thanks
Jay for supplying all the best material for

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.899
the speech and thanks for the honor of being
your best man.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.659
Special thanks to the one man film crew of
Jeff "JailHause" Hauserman. He carried that

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:09.249
giant camera all by himself.
