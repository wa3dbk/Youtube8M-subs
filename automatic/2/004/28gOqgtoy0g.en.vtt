 [Music] 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.970
 do not 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:19.960
 all right

 [Music] 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.750
 to oral and maxillofacial surgery 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.990
 oral and maxillofacial surgery is the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.600
 surgical medical specialty and 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 dental care for prevention 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.480
 study diagnosis and treatment 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.269
 rehabilitation of oral diseases 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.309
 Facials and facial skull territory as well 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.650
 as of the organs and structures 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.420
 cervical related direct or 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.420
 indirectly with the same 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 what is the field of action of a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.440
 maxillofacial surgeon for being a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.330
 specialist of dentistry his 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.310
 objectives are aimed at giving 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.520
 functional and aesthetic solutions 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.979
 when anomalies in the jaws are 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.150
 is for this reason our field of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.150
 action is related to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.920
 joint disorders and facial pain the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.290
 temporomandibular joint is a 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.420
 small joint by means of the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.090
 which jaw articulates with the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.070
 skull this important structure looks 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.900
 usually affected when there are 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.600
 problems in the growth of 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.270
 jaws and also when there 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.880
 disorders or disharmonies among 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.700
 dental organs reason this one could 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.700
 unleash pains at this level and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.110
 even facial pains 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.110
 orthognathic surgery 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.310
 surgery aimed at correcting 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.620
 shape and position size deformities 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.530
 of the jaws and their structures 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.450
 close to harmonize their effects 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.840
 on the facial and occlusal projection 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.840
 dental implantology 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.490
 the restoration of lost teeth 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.940
 by means of dental implants maintaining 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.740
 Bone height and facial structures 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.760
 avoiding premature aging 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.760
 facial trauma 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.280
 car accidents and the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 violence are some of the factors 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.710
 triggers for queries 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.780
 facial trauma emergency department 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.530
 compromise structures of both tissues 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.650
 soft alveolar teeth and bones 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.290
 Facials causing lost fractures 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.710
 of tissue and dental organs that are 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.720
 treated by the maxillofacial surgeon 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.240
 returning the traumatized patient his 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.520
 projections and facial height from the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.250
 adequate and functional reduction of 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.750
 dental occlusion 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.060
 distraction osteo gene 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.490
 when the jaws are narrow 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.100
 showing stacking teeth 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.920
 and black holes in the smiles is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.920
 indicated not the dental extraction but the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.380
 Stretch of the bone callus achieved 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.700
 previously with an osteotomy of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.700
 poor maxilla 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.209
 reconstructive surgery 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.070
 the patients who are subjected to 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.430
 therapeutic receptions either by 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.980
 cancer infection or trauma by losing 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.410
 Bone and soft tissue continuity 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.750
 they can be mutilations that must be 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.180
 corrected to avoid deformities 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.430
 facial in this case the surgeon 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.010
 maxillofacial in conjunction with other 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.110
 medical disciplines must reestablish 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.690
 the function and appearance the most 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.390
 close to the previous appearance 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:55.730
 avoiding psychological traumas in our 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:57.980
 patients oral pathology 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.430
 the pathologies that involve 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.620
 jaws such as cysts 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.019
 malformations tumors and diseases 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.420
 Systemic diseases with cavity involvement 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.000
 oral congenital diseases and 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.980
 craniofacial malformations are 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.010
 managed by the specialty of surgery 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.780
 maxillofacial way 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.280
 multidisciplinary managing to reestablish 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.280
 to the patient integrally 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.210
 zygomatic implants in the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.699
 rehabilitation with maxillary implants 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.830
 than we often encounter 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.680
 problems in the placement of implants 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.840
 in order to obtain a fixed prosthesis 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.630
 this situation has changed form 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.690
 radical thanks to the implants 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.759
 zygomatic these implants are based on 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.009
 more modern concepts with the 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.800
 use of the remaining bone that 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 has the patient so it removes the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.010
 need for bone grafts and therefore 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.940
 simplifies the treatment by providing great 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:17.159
 amount of advantages
