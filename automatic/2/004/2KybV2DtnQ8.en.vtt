00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
no there's no access to the harness i

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.280 
no there's no access to the harness i
guess<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.680> can<00:03:17.770> modify<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.900> his<00:03:19.900> pocket

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
guess you can modify this his pocket

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.500 
guess you can modify this his pocket
right<00:03:20.410> here<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.400> cut<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.000> reseal

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
right here and you can cut it and reseal

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.390 
right here and you can cut it and reseal
it<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:23.170> have<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> slot<00:03:23.620> for<00:03:23.680> your<00:03:23.980> hearts<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.310> go

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
it to have a slot for your hearts to go

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.700 
it to have a slot for your hearts to go
through<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.750> only<00:03:26.230> other<00:03:26.380> thing<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.590> I

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
through and the only other thing that I

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.190 
through and the only other thing that I
noticed<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.160> asus<00:03:27.730> trained<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.870> walk<00:03:29.050> in

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
noticed is a asus trained to to walk in

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.540 
noticed is a asus trained to to walk in
the<00:03:29.260> heel<00:03:29.410> position<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.980> his<00:03:30.100> shoulder<00:03:30.370> blade

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
the heel position so his shoulder blade

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.550 
the heel position so his shoulder blade
is<00:03:30.700> directly<00:03:31.210> aligned<00:03:31.480> with<00:03:31.690> my<00:03:31.810> left<00:03:32.050> leg<00:03:32.230> and

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
is directly aligned with my left leg and

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.810 
is directly aligned with my left leg and
so<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.940> pack<00:03:34.270> either<00:03:35.160> hooked<00:03:36.160> my<00:03:36.370> leg<00:03:36.400> or

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
so this pack either hooked my leg or

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.550 
so this pack either hooked my leg or
eyeball<00:03:37.120> Tim<00:03:37.390> with<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.290> got<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.470> little

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
eyeball Tim with it so that got a little

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.010 
eyeball Tim with it so that got a little
frustrating<00:03:39.040> for<00:03:39.130> both<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.459> us<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:39.780> he<00:03:40.780> ended

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
frustrating for both of us so he ended

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.570 
frustrating for both of us so he ended
up<00:03:41.140> walking<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.770> little<00:03:41.950> bit<00:03:42.130> forward<00:03:42.400> but

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
up walking a little bit forward but

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.910 
up walking a little bit forward but
she's<00:03:42.820> very<00:03:42.880> he's<00:03:43.840> not<00:03:43.990> used<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.290> doing<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.800> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
she's very he's not used to doing so the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.780 
she's very he's not used to doing so the
whole<00:03:45.070> time<00:03:45.100> he's<00:03:45.490> kind<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.700> looking

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
whole time he's kind of looking

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.310 
whole time he's kind of looking
backwards<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.540> looking<00:03:46.750> back<00:03:46.840> over<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.170> see

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
backwards and looking back over to see

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.290 
backwards and looking back over to see
where<00:03:47.470> I'm<00:03:47.590> at<00:03:47.880> because<00:03:48.880> that's<00:03:49.030> how<00:03:49.150> he's

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
where I'm at because that's how he's

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.690 
where I'm at because that's how he's
trained<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:51.070> something<00:03:51.160> ball<00:03:51.490> to<00:03:51.580> get

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
trained so that is something ball to get

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.140 
trained so that is something ball to get
they<00:03:52.209> get<00:03:52.330> accustomed<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:53.970> he<00:03:54.970> laid<00:03:55.120> down

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
they get accustomed to now he laid down

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.000 
they get accustomed to now he laid down
with<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.020> kind<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.260> shifted<00:03:56.680> when<00:03:56.950> we

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
with this and kind of shifted when we

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.009 
with this and kind of shifted when we
got<00:03:57.130> back<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:57.580> shifting<00:03:57.940> back<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.780> there's

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
got back up and shifting back so there's

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.840 
got back up and shifting back so there's
no<00:03:59.200> real<00:03:59.410> issue<00:03:59.650> with<00:03:59.920> with<00:04:00.250> him<00:04:00.400> laying<00:04:00.610> down

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
no real issue with with him laying down

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.580 
no real issue with with him laying down
the<00:04:01.750> weight<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.230> pretty<00:04:02.440> minimal<00:04:02.590> middle

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the weight is pretty minimal middle

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.530 
the weight is pretty minimal middle
through<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.830> couple<00:04:04.069> books<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.430> here<00:04:04.700> it's<00:04:05.420> a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
through a couple books in here it's a

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.210 
through a couple books in here it's a
couple<00:04:05.840> softback<00:04:06.260> books<00:04:06.530> needs<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.950> give<00:04:07.099> it

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
couple softback books needs to give it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.070 
couple softback books needs to give it
some<00:04:07.400> weights<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:07.849> volume<00:04:08.209> but<00:04:08.810> i<00:04:08.840> probably

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
some weights and volume but i probably

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.229 
some weights and volume but i probably
wouldn't<00:04:09.349> carry<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:10.519> much<00:04:10.700> stuff<00:04:10.940> on<00:04:11.120> this

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
wouldn't carry that much stuff on this

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.270 
wouldn't carry that much stuff on this
is<00:04:11.420> mainly<00:04:11.780> carry<00:04:12.110> his<00:04:12.349> his<00:04:12.650> needs<00:04:12.980> in

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
is mainly carry his his needs in

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.100 
is mainly carry his his needs in
reference<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.120> his<00:04:14.239> food<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> other

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
reference to his food and the other

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.140 
reference to his food and the other
watering<00:04:15.709> like<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.970> only<00:04:17.120> other

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
watering like that the only other

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.819 
watering like that the only other
question<00:04:17.449> that<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.870> have<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.139> do<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.470> little<00:04:18.560> more

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
question that I have to do a little more

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.159 
question that I have to do a little more
research<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.489> us<00:04:19.729> is<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.479> cold<00:04:20.750> weather<00:04:20.989> like

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
research on us is it cold weather like

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.170 
research on us is it cold weather like
this<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.949> going<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.400> insulate<00:04:22.790> him<00:04:22.970> anymore

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
this is going to insulate him anymore

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.420 
this is going to insulate him anymore
because<00:04:23.479> it's<00:04:23.660> more<00:04:23.780> material<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.440> war<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:25.220> it

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
because it's more material of war is it

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.800 
because it's more material of war is it
actually<00:04:25.550> going<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.850> make<00:04:26.270> him<00:04:26.419> colder

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
actually going to make him colder

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.500 
actually going to make him colder
because<00:04:26.990> this<00:04:27.860> person<00:04:28.100> allowed<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.550> be<00:04:28.699> fluffy

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
because this person allowed to be fluffy

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.790 
because this person allowed to be fluffy
and<00:04:29.660> had<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.930> dense<00:04:30.110> base<00:04:30.380> which<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.620> going

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
and had that dense base which is going

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.710 
and had that dense base which is going
to<00:04:30.889> get<00:04:30.979> slit<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.280> better<00:04:31.460> my<00:04:32.060> guess<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.600> is

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
to get slit it better my guess this is

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.510 
to get slit it better my guess this is
actually<00:04:32.960> gonna<00:04:33.050> make<00:04:33.229> him<00:04:33.350> colder<00:04:33.830> even

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
actually gonna make him colder even

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.350 
actually gonna make him colder even
though<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.699> would<00:04:34.820> think<00:04:35.000> that<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.330> would

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
though you would think that it would

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.909 
though you would think that it would
insulate<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.930> more<00:04:36.080> be<00:04:36.229> more<00:04:36.500> material

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
insulate it more be more material

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.980 
insulate it more be more material
wrapped<00:04:37.040> around<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.180> have<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.660> research

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
wrapped around so I have to research

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.600 
wrapped around so I have to research
that<00:04:39.139> a<00:04:39.200> little<00:04:39.410> bit<00:04:39.470> more<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:40.250> know<00:04:40.280> dogs

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
that a little bit more you know dogs

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.460 
that a little bit more you know dogs
really<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.330> quite<00:04:41.630> rare<00:04:41.870> for<00:04:42.080> dogs<00:04:42.260> go

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
really it's quite rare for dogs go

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.680 
really it's quite rare for dogs go
through<00:04:42.680> hypothermia<00:04:43.220> lesser<00:04:44.090> submerged

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
through hypothermia lesser submerged

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.540 
through hypothermia lesser submerged
water<00:04:45.020> for<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> long<00:04:45.440> time<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.889> those<00:04:46.010> extreme

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
water for a long time of those extreme

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.090
