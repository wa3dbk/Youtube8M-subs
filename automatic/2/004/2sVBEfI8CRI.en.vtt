00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
wondering what it is I got a picture of

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.509 
wondering what it is I got a picture of
it<00:00:41.379> right<00:00:41.589> here<00:00:42.339> you<00:00:43.239> can<00:00:43.390> see<00:00:43.889> basically<00:00:44.889> you

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
it right here you can see basically you

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.930 
it right here you can see basically you
were<00:00:45.670> like<00:00:46.329> upper<00:00:46.809> or<00:00:47.019> bikini<00:00:47.829> for<00:00:48.069> a<00:00:48.129> chest<00:00:48.489> so

I guess that's the reason why people
want<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:52.089> know<00:00:52.239> people<00:00:52.539> are<00:00:52.809> weird<00:00:53.049> so
