00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
technique is really handy what I'm going

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.690 
technique is really handy what I'm going
to<00:02:29.049> do<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.470> I'm<00:02:29.709> going<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.890> take<00:02:30.099> this<00:02:30.340> sleeve

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
to do is I'm going to take this sleeve

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.400 
to do is I'm going to take this sleeve
that<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.180> cut<00:02:31.390> off<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:32.230> actually

that I just cut off and I'm actually

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.410 
that I just cut off and I'm actually
going<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> use<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.069> as<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> template<00:02:33.879> on<00:02:34.030> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
going to use it as a template on the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.539 
going to use it as a template on the
other<00:02:34.599> side<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.260> shirt<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.099> lay<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.459> on

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
other side of the shirt so I lay it on

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.250 
other side of the shirt so I lay it on
this<00:02:36.670> sleeve<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.989> be<00:02:38.049> able<00:02:38.110> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
this sleeve and I'm going to be able to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.600 
this sleeve and I'm going to be able to
find<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> exact<00:02:38.890> same<00:02:39.099> spot<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.519> other

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
find the exact same spot on the other

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.880 
find the exact same spot on the other
side<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.810> where<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.989> start<00:02:41.170> cutting<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.620> one

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
side to where to start cutting this one

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.100 
side to where to start cutting this one
so<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.370> make<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.579> little<00:02:42.730> incision<00:02:42.879> there<00:02:43.420> Boop

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
so I make a little incision there Boop

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.470 
so I make a little incision there Boop
start<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.890> off<00:02:45.099> then<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.970> figure<00:02:46.360> out<00:02:46.390> where

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
start that off then I figure out where
