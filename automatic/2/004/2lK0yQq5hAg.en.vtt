00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
little while to power with cool furnaces

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.630 
little while to power with cool furnaces
so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> fire<00:00:15.929> got<00:00:16.170> these<00:00:16.789> cool<00:00:19.189> cool<00:00:20.189> generate

with<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:24.500> insulated<00:00:25.500> super<00:00:26.720> conductor

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
with the insulated super conductor

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.840 
with the insulated super conductor
cables<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.740> then<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.699> goes<00:00:29.970> over<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.869> my

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
cables and then this goes over to my

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.690 
cables and then this goes over to my
launch<00:00:32.850> control<00:00:33.300> panel<00:00:33.809> t1<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.460> what

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
launch control panel t1 and then what

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
explosion was back em I think so I don't

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
explosion was back em I think so I don't
know<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.509> happened<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:04.140> because

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
know really what happened there because

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.109 
know really what happened there because
it<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.280> weird<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.880> didn't

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it was all so weird because it didn't

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.190 
it was all so weird because it didn't
actually<00:02:06.299> detonate<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:09.020> three<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.140> four

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
actually detonate for like three or four
minutes<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.860> could<00:02:10.890> stop<00:02:11.310> filming<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> was

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
minutes I could stop filming it was

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220 
minutes I could stop filming it was
doing<00:02:12.360> something<00:02:12.569> else

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
