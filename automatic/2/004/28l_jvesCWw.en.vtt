for me I was going to take

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.780 
for me I was going to take
chip<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:17.080> see<00:00:17.260> what<00:00:17.380> firmware<00:00:17.950> was<00:00:18.279> needed<00:00:18.700> to

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
chip to see what firmware was needed to

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.660 
chip to see what firmware was needed to
be<00:00:18.880> extracted<00:00:19.119> or<00:00:19.840> something<00:00:20.470> like<00:00:20.590> that<00:00:20.830> but

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670

readers pop it into your PC if you've

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.560 
readers pop it into your PC if you've
got<00:01:02.620> Linux<00:01:03.070> you're<00:01:03.339> laughing<00:01:03.519> because<00:01:04.449> you

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
got Linux you're laughing because you

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.120 
got Linux you're laughing because you
can<00:01:04.690> read<00:01:04.839> all<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> files<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:05.800> change

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
can read all the files you can change

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.410 
can read all the files you can change
them<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.790> could<00:01:06.970> back<00:01:07.150> up<00:01:07.180> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:09.700> even<00:01:10.150> in

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
them you could back up I think even in

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.880 
them you could back up I think even in
their<00:01:10.600> transfers<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.350> firmware

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
their transfers the firmware

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
system files that are hidden and once

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.610 
system files that are hidden and once
you've<00:01:21.070> done<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.310> I've<00:01:22.000> managed<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.960> clone

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
it completely onto this 16 gigabyte so

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.530 
it completely onto this 16 gigabyte so
when<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.330> pop<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:32.770> here<00:01:33.330> don't<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:34.450> to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
when I pop that into here don't have to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
there we go put the 16 gig in now if

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.920 
there we go put the 16 gig in now if
you've<00:01:55.210> copied<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.720> files<00:01:55.990> correctly<00:01:57.930> you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
you've copied the files correctly you

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.150 
you've copied the files correctly you
just<00:01:59.260> have<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.710> press<00:02:00.040> reset<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.770> you've<00:02:05.950> done

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
just have to press reset if you've done

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.090 
just have to press reset if you've done
it<00:02:06.190> correctly<00:02:06.430> as<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.030> say<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:09.250> will<00:02:09.459> come<00:02:09.610> on

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it correctly as I say it will come on
