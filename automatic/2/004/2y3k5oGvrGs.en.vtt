00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
which is like the original scandi knives

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
which is like the original scandi knives
not<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> ones<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.780> market<00:02:04.229> today<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
not like the ones they market today but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.889 
not like the ones they market today but
the<00:02:04.890> original<00:02:05.369> ones<00:02:05.549> by<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.030> original<00:02:06.630> Sami

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the original ones by the original Sami

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
the original ones by the original Sami
people<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> had<00:02:07.649> these<00:02:07.860> knives<00:02:08.099> they're

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
people that had these knives they're

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.029 
people that had these knives they're
convex<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.349> impossible<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
convex because you it's impossible to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.130 
convex because you it's impossible to
have<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> flat<00:02:11.520> edge<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
have a flat edge that you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.110 
have a flat edge that you
and<00:02:13.350> by<00:02:13.440> hand<00:02:13.650> they<00:02:13.830> get<00:02:14.040> convex<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:15.060> were

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and by hand they get convex they were

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.930 
and by hand they get convex they were
designed<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> convex<00:02:16.100> if<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.280> if<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.640> look<00:02:17.790> at

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
designed to convex if you if you look at

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.200 
designed to convex if you if you look at
the<00:02:18.030> point<00:02:18.680> notice<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.920> point<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.370> in

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
the point notice that the point is in

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.210 
the point notice that the point is in
the<00:02:22.110> center<00:02:22.850> which<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.390> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
the center which is what I like and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.170 
the center which is what I like and
bushcraft<00:02:26.220> guys<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.640> say<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:26.940> for

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
bushcraft guys will say that's for

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.120 
bushcraft guys will say that's for
drilling<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.400> works<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:31.130> for

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
drilling it is it works for that for

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.610 
drilling it is it works for that for
batoning<00:02:32.720> look<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> other<00:02:34.050> commonality

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
batoning look at the other commonality

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.680 
batoning look at the other commonality
here<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:35.550> notice<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.030> grind<00:02:36.330> doesn't

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
here you notice that this grind doesn't

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.090 
here you notice that this grind doesn't

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
I'm not even sure but because I just

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.550 
I'm not even sure but because I just
from<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.340> time<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.610> was<00:03:23.670> about<00:03:23.790> 14<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:25.080> 65

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
from the time I was about 14 and I'm 65

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.229 
from the time I was about 14 and I'm 65
now<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:26.040> use<00:03:26.280> knives<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.910> didn't<00:03:27.120> need

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
now just use knives and I didn't need

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.080 
now just use knives and I didn't need
names<00:03:27.570> for<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.959> particular<00:03:28.290> holes<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.070> use<00:03:29.280> but

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
names for the particular holes I use but

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.360 
names for the particular holes I use but
this<00:03:31.080> one<00:03:31.320> would<00:03:31.680> be<00:03:31.799> comfortable<00:03:32.160> no<00:03:32.340> matter

it's one of those innovative knives
we've<00:03:40.799> ever<00:03:40.980> designed<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.670> that's<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
we've ever designed and that's the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.310 
we've ever designed and that's the
ultralight<00:03:43.739> bushcrafter<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:45.660> only<00:03:45.959> weighs

two<00:03:46.920> point<00:03:47.160> seven<00:03:47.400> ounces<00:03:47.930> it's<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.110> smaller

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
two point seven ounces it's a smaller

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.970 
two point seven ounces it's a smaller
