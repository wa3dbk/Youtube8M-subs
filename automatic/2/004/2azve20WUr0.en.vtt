00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
oh my god what's this new video did

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.940 
oh my god what's this new video did
hello<00:00:06.569> guys<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:06.839> today<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.680> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.830> be

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
hello guys and today we're going to be

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.410 
hello guys and today we're going to be
building<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.639> wire<00:00:09.030> mod<00:00:09.469> teleporter<00:00:10.880> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.150> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
building a wire mod teleporter this is a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.020 
building a wire mod teleporter this is a
very<00:00:12.660> basic<00:00:13.190> teleporter<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.429> can<00:00:14.580> expand

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
very basic teleporter but you can expand

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.220 
very basic teleporter but you can expand
on<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.450> by<00:00:16.010> making<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> vehicle<00:00:18.230> anything

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
on this by making it vehicle anything

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
on this by making it vehicle anything
you<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.730> why<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.150> if

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
you know how to do with why I'm on if

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.870 
you know how to do with why I'm on if
you<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.630> lay<00:00:21.960> them<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> be

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you just lay them in this is going to be

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.140 
you just lay them in this is going to be
simple<00:00:25.279> basically<00:00:26.279> first<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> go<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
simple basically first you have to go to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
simple basically first you have to go to
Harvard<00:00:27.510> drive<00:00:27.840> controller<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.710> wire

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
Harvard drive controller and a wire

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.749 
Harvard drive controller and a wire
physics<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.910> choose<00:00:30.810> your<00:00:31.050> model<00:00:31.759> then

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
physics and choose your model then

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120 
physics and choose your model then
you'll<00:00:33.000> place<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.870> whatever<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.649> want<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you'll place it on whatever you want to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.119 
you'll place it on whatever you want to
teleport<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.940> place<00:00:36.210> two<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> them<00:00:37.129> because

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
teleport and place two of them because

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.220 
teleport and place two of them because
each<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.610> goes<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.059> different<00:00:39.180> destination

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.670 

next<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> get<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.000> button<00:00:45.680> or

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
next you're going to get the button or

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.319 
next you're going to get the button or
two<00:00:47.219> buttons<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> instant

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
two buttons for this is instant

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.600 
two buttons for this is instant
so<00:00:51.329> we'll<00:00:51.870> take<00:00:52.320> toggle<00:00:52.829> off<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.370> we

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so we'll take toggle off because we

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
so we'll take toggle off because we
don't<00:00:53.820> want<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> stay<00:00:54.480> down<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> port<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
don't want it to stay down a port it we

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.479 
don't want it to stay down a port it we
want<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> care<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.360> stay<00:00:58.020> there

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
want to care for and just stay there

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.799 
want to care for and just stay there
don't<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.699> anywhere<00:01:00.059> else<00:01:00.149> until<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.570> place

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
don't go anywhere else until we place

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
don't go anywhere else until we place
the<00:01:01.020> other<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:04.280> next<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> need<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the other one next we're going to need a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
the other one next we're going to need a
GPS<00:01:07.130> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> top<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> menu

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
GPS which is the at the top of the menu

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.100 
GPS which is the at the top of the menu
and<00:01:11.479> it's<00:01:12.479> under<00:01:12.900> wire<00:01:13.140> detection<00:01:14.720> for<00:01:15.720> two<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and it's under wire detection for two of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.980 
and it's under wire detection for two of
these<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> lift<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.090> slightly<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
these and lift them slightly out the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.050 
these and lift them slightly out the
ground<00:01:21.860> next<00:01:22.860> you're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> wire

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
ground next you're going to go to wire

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740 
ground next you're going to go to wire
advanced<00:01:24.810> which<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.140> near<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> bottom<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:27.000> up

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
advanced which is near the bottom to up

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.640 
advanced which is near the bottom to up
I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:31.020> soon<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.500> get

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
I think it is so as soon as you get

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.240 
I think it is so as soon as you get
there<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:33.240> sure<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> width<00:01:33.840> though<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there you make sure the width though is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.679 
there you make sure the width though is
zero<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
zero because you don't want to have a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.710 
zero because you don't want to have a
line<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.390> which<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.540> did

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

I messed it up a bit but okay you're
gonna<00:01:54.000> need<00:01:54.210> wire<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.079> make<00:01:55.200> sure<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.649> 0

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
gonna need wire and make sure it's on 0

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.880 
gonna need wire and make sure it's on 0
then<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.880> link<00:01:57.149> jump<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.530> button

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
then you link jump to the button

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.999 
then you link jump to the button
finished<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.729> each<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.329> each<00:02:00.710> arm<00:02:01.710> drive

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
finished one each one each arm drive

finished one each one each arm drive
controller<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:03.840> units<00:02:04.200> volunteers<00:02:04.619> UPS's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
controller now units volunteers UPS's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.779 
controller now units volunteers UPS's
and<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.780> white<00:02:07.110> advanced<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and now if you go to white advanced you

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.400 
and now if you go to white advanced you
can<00:02:08.819> link<00:02:09.179> x<00:02:09.479> y&amp;z<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.830> each<00:02:11.280> one

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
can link x y&amp;z up to each one

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.440 
can link x y&amp;z up to each one
so<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.010> did<00:02:13.310> XAR<00:02:14.170> why<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:16.210> said<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.420> that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
so I did XAR why I said so that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.840 
so I did XAR why I said so that
basically<00:02:17.800> teleports<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.460> location

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
basically teleports it to the location

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.450 
basically teleports it to the location
with<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.390> GPS<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.430> other

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
with the GPS you do it with the other

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.050 
with the GPS you do it with the other
one<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:22.850> well<00:02:27.340> there<00:02:28.340> are<00:02:28.370> more<00:02:28.730> advanced

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
one as well there are more advanced

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.690 
one as well there are more advanced
teleporters<00:02:29.990> where<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.380> saves<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.950> location

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
teleporters where it saves the location
