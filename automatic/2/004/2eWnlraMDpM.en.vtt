well<00:00:39.649> guess<00:00:39.829> what<00:00:40.070> youtube<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.300> decided<00:00:42.140> to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
well guess what youtube I decided to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.930 
well guess what youtube I decided to
start<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.280> lighter<00:00:44.120> garden<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.129> fall<00:00:46.640> of

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940

start a lighter garden and it is fall of
two<00:00:47.150> thousand<00:00:47.600> thirteen<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.260> my<00:00:48.410> fault<00:00:48.680> and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
two thousand thirteen it's my fault and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.689 
two thousand thirteen it's my fault and
my<00:00:50.360> goal<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.500> do<00:00:51.650> more<00:00:51.860> experiments<00:00:52.250> as

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
my goal is to do more experiments as

my goal is to do more experiments as
I've<00:00:53.180> stated<00:00:53.330> before<00:00:53.629> in<00:00:54.610> previous<00:00:55.610> videos

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
back from a weekend after it rained for

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.530 
back from a weekend after it rained for
one<00:03:19.329> day<00:03:19.540> solid<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.349> these<00:03:21.220> were<00:03:21.430> dead<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
one day solid and these were dead the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.479 
one day solid and these were dead the
one<00:03:22.690> over<00:03:22.720> there<00:03:22.959> still<00:03:23.440> struggling<00:03:23.980> along<00:03:24.220> I

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
one over there still struggling along I

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.920

blown<00:04:10.060> away<00:04:10.120> by<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.959> massive<00:04:11.919> amount<00:04:12.159> of

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
blown away by the massive amount of

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.360 
blown away by the massive amount of
growth<00:04:13.239> that<00:04:13.629> I've<00:04:14.139> seen<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.829> last<00:04:14.859> three

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
growth that I've seen in the last three

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.210 
growth that I've seen in the last three
weeks<00:04:15.400> from<00:04:15.819> these<00:04:16.060> tomatoes<00:04:16.539> I<00:04:17.070> do<00:04:18.070> not

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
weeks from these tomatoes I do not

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.689 
weeks from these tomatoes I do not
believe<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.880> my<00:04:19.030> tomatoes<00:04:19.479> grew<00:04:19.810> this<00:04:19.989> fast

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
believe that my tomatoes grew this fast

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.980 
believe that my tomatoes grew this fast
through<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.820> summer<00:04:22.060> months<00:04:22.240> which<00:04:22.599> would<00:04:22.870> be

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
through the summer months which would be

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.629 
through the summer months which would be
even<00:04:23.349> more<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.889> an<00:04:24.039> optimum<00:04:24.580> or<00:04:24.760> an<00:04:24.970> ideal

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
even more of an optimum or an ideal

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.719 
even more of an optimum or an ideal
growing<00:04:27.639> period<00:04:28.440> however<00:04:29.440> they<00:04:30.340> have<00:04:30.370> been

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
growing period however they have been

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.710 
growing period however they have been
doing<00:04:31.060> very<00:04:31.780> well<00:04:32.050> so<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:33.370> plan<00:04:33.760> at<00:04:33.940> two<00:04:34.240> per

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
doing very well so I plan at two per

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.120 
doing very well so I plan at two per
section<00:04:35.349> and<00:04:35.530> my<00:04:36.010> goal<00:04:36.250> was<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:37.770> thin<00:04:38.770> them<00:04:39.010> out

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
section and my goal was to thin them out

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.200 
section and my goal was to thin them out
and<00:04:39.490> string<00:04:40.360> them<00:04:40.389> up<00:04:40.949> as<00:04:41.949> soon<00:04:42.550> as<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.880> seen

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
and string them up as soon as I seen

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.180 
and string them up as soon as I seen
which<00:04:43.960> ones<00:04:44.260> would<00:04:44.530> be<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:45.460> better<00:04:45.789> fit<00:04:46.120> for

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
which ones would be the better fit for

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.089 
which ones would be the better fit for
the<00:04:48.190> garden<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.699> which<00:04:49.690> ones<00:04:49.960> would<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
the garden and which ones would be the

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.350 
the garden and which ones would be the
most<00:04:54.599> aggressive

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
most aggressive

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.580 
most aggressive
and<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.710> I'm<00:04:57.830> doing<00:04:57.979> that<00:04:58.189> now<00:04:59.289> again<00:05:00.289> I've

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
and so I'm doing that now again I've

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.649 
and so I'm doing that now again I've
only<00:05:00.979> fed<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:01.719> fed<00:05:02.719> these<00:05:02.900> plants<00:05:03.349> two<00:05:03.860> times

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
only fed this fed these plants two times

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.409 
only fed this fed these plants two times
once<00:05:05.659> when<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:05.930> planted<00:05:06.379> them<00:05:06.439> and<00:05:06.800> once<00:05:07.669> a<00:05:08.030> week

where it was large and then it tapered
