00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
a knee injury I think this guy was one

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.749 
a knee injury I think this guy was one
of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> greatest<00:01:32.130> running<00:01:32.400> backs<00:01:32.640> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
of the greatest running backs in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
of the greatest running backs in
football<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> his<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.020> he<00:01:34.530> would<00:01:34.650> have

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
football in his time and he would have

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740 
football in his time and he would have
ate<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> whole<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.210> yards<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
ate up a whole lot more yards and I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.440 
ate up a whole lot more yards and I
think<00:01:36.960> Carolina<00:01:37.350> Panthers<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:38.450> would

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
think Carolina Panthers probably would

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.819 
think Carolina Panthers probably would
have<00:01:39.540> went<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> whole<00:01:40.259> lot<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:40.590> success

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
have went on to a whole lot more success

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.880 
have went on to a whole lot more success

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
then just sort of falling off the face

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.999 
then just sort of falling off the face
of<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.030> earth<00:01:54.060> after<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.079> um<00:01:56.299> man<00:01:58.009> you

I don't like to come out and say that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.499 
I don't like to come out and say that
this<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> an<00:02:02.729> easy<00:02:02.850> game<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> San

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
this is an easy game for the San

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.209 
this is an easy game for the San
Francisco<00:02:03.600> 49ers<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> teams

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
Francisco 49ers because of the teams

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
Francisco 49ers because of the teams
that<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.000> Panthers<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.600> been<00:02:06.719> playing

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960

independent<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> bead<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
independent of the bead I think this is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.910 
independent of the bead I think this is
honestly<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.849> team<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.840> could<00:02:10.020> show<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
honestly a team that could show up and

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.300 
honestly a team that could show up and
beat<00:02:11.129> us<00:02:11.310> especially<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.910> us<00:02:11.970> coming<00:02:12.209> off<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
beat us especially with us coming off a

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.210 
beat us especially with us coming off a
a<00:02:13.580> bye<00:02:14.150> week<00:02:14.180> after<00:02:14.870> being<00:02:14.900> over<00:02:15.650> London<00:02:16.099> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
playing Jacksonville beating them so

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.510 
playing Jacksonville beating them so
decisively<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:21.380> know<00:02:21.500> maybe<00:02:22.010> maybe

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
decisively and you know maybe maybe

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.449 
decisively and you know maybe maybe
taking<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.780> week<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.170> little<00:02:24.920> lightly<00:02:25.280> it's

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
taking this week a little lightly it's

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.729 
taking this week a little lightly it's
going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> take<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.849> whole<00:02:26.120> lot<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.590> pushing<00:02:27.590> for

going to take a whole lot of pushing for
the<00:02:27.950> cushion<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.550> think<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.270> there's<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.599> lot

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the cushion I think that there's a lot

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.530 
the cushion I think that there's a lot
of<00:02:29.840> people<00:02:30.019> showing<00:02:30.440> up<00:02:30.680> into<00:02:30.980> camp

anybody else to put on there but how the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.979 
anybody else to put on there but how the
