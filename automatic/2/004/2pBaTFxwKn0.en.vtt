00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello here is noticed that Bayern and I could show we want the whole 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.660
 Action Smith the TEG 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.840
 One-to-one transfer to all other computers 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.019
 Messis noticed how many bought my Mac Book 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.660
 and mean a pope for the first time the reason SchÃ¶nwald life 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.349
 this message comes 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.649
 that was an iPod already connected to the other old and winking iCloud 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.259
 and that's why I can not sync 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.919
 or I may delete all my data 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.159
 and connect old one will reckon with these 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.309
 that's the problem that all game saves and everything else 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.340
 is away 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.100
 she shows Micah Kogo the end is possible 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.880
 to transfer the whole old one with the TT one to one and this logically 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.120
 Take connection and there is a look and then I'll show you now 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.630
 as he himself would have to look that closed on both computers as five 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.910
 is 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.170
 Then he places it in the tower around the hard drive or the skin settings 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.190
 then also users 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.970
 your name 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 and then for that 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.120
 and then he looks for the iTunes folder 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.530
 and all Dirty files are included that is as CAD and 1 million sec 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.750
 everything else 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.940
 and all these files 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.440
 to imitate 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 and place this iTunes folder on an external hard drive 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.600
 then he unplugged the hard drive and closed it at the computer where he was us 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.390
 separates only examples 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 and you have to Cuban that he as a guy on the computer on the fair Wendenburg 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.010
 completely emptied out that all music tracks from the program out 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.570
 to take 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.850
 and then 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.850
 that love me this folder 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.289
 this puts casting existing empty itunes folder 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.560
 by the impact firmly so that means 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.549
 indexed folders would be present which rejected the disk 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.090
 Chicken year one 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.540
 and then I'll ask him if he wanted to replace it all at that time 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.379
 year 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.809
 then the whole thing would be the whole as Ensminger ZEK 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.919
 from the hard drive to your computer 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.999
 and then next time 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.189
 Mr. Jones - that's what you call 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.189
 then all data should be present 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.199
 unless 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.489
 then you can if you are old and SafeNet that is soon - I think that 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.259
 shift-key and in Mac the old key so Althoff pursue 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.369
 then hurry to meet five 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.619
 and then you can here because he fails with the Tate 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.529
 and that's just these old varieties again 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.259
 the secular 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.859
 then I'll give you guys 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.739
 and then here I am iTunes Library point the CL and then it will open soon 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.159
 as an aid war on the new pact stretching 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.829
 To get a rank off then you can leave a comment 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:02:59.890
 and then it is to look
