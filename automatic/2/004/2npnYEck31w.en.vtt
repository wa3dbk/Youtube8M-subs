00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.850 
I have never seen a video game like this
in<00:01:54.040> my<00:01:54.160> life<00:01:54.400> it's<00:01:55.030> not<00:01:55.240> my<00:01:55.450> regular<00:01:55.720> genre<00:01:56.500> and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
in my life it's not my regular genre and

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.070 
in my life it's not my regular genre and
as<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.580> said<00:01:57.640> before<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.270> was<00:01:58.450> picked<00:01:58.720> up<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:59.050> a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
as I said before this was picked up on a

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.380 
as I said before this was picked up on a
whim<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.680> it<00:02:00.490> looks<00:02:00.640> like<00:02:00.730> I'm<00:02:00.910> gonna<00:02:01.030> finally

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
whim and it looks like I'm gonna finally

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.830 
whim and it looks like I'm gonna finally
end<00:02:01.630> up<00:02:01.750> trying<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.350> out<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.490> last<00:02:03.670> item<00:02:03.910> in

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
end up trying it out so the last item in

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.249 
end up trying it out so the last item in
the<00:02:05.020> unboxing<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.800> this<00:02:06.100> t-shirt<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:08.080> you

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
the unboxing is this t-shirt and as you

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.730 
the unboxing is this t-shirt and as you
can<00:02:08.349> see<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.340> hearts<00:02:09.910> are<00:02:10.090> close<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.539> empty

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
can see the hearts are close to empty

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.440 
can see the hearts are close to empty
and<00:02:11.740> again<00:02:12.280> if<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.490> want<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.730> rock<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.150> baby

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
and again if you want to rock this baby

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
and again if you want to rock this baby
that's<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.840> large<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.260> well

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
that's a large as well

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's a large as well
which<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.280> probably<00:02:15.490> important<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.270> know<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
which is probably important to know and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.380 
which is probably important to know and
the<00:02:18.160> last<00:02:18.370> thing<00:02:18.520> we've<00:02:18.640> got<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.030> actual

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the last thing we've got is the actual

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.970 
the last thing we've got is the actual
game<00:02:19.570> as<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.810> mentioned<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> gaming

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
game as I mentioned there is a gaming

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.450 
game as I mentioned there is a gaming
here<00:02:21.340> somewhere<00:02:21.850> there<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:24.280> game

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
here somewhere there it is and the game

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.520 
here somewhere there it is and the game
itself<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:25.090> fairly<00:02:25.390> straightforward<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.380> mean

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
itself is fairly straightforward I mean

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.990 
itself is fairly straightforward I mean
it's<00:02:26.710> there's<00:02:27.010> nothing<00:02:27.250> special<00:02:27.460> inside<00:02:27.970> I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
it's there's nothing special inside I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's there's nothing special inside I
don't<00:02:28.210> even<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.690> there's<00:02:28.840> any<00:02:28.990> DLC<00:02:29.620> or

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
don't even think there's any DLC or

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.990 
don't even think there's any DLC or
anything<00:02:29.950> like<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.220> at<00:02:30.460> least<00:02:30.610> there<00:02:30.760> wasn't

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
anything like that at least there wasn't

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.830 
anything like that at least there wasn't
a<00:02:31.030> pamphlet<00:02:31.620> identifying<00:02:32.620> any<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.660> only

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
a pamphlet identifying any and the only

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.620 
a pamphlet identifying any and the only
thing<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.170> mention<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:36.610> has<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> fairly

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
thing to mention is that it has a fairly

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.120 
thing to mention is that it has a fairly
significant<00:02:38.260> manual<00:02:38.650> I'll<00:02:38.740> show<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.070> in

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
a second yes that was two different

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.330

here's the game and you know as I said
before<00:02:53.680> everything<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> way<00:02:54.910> you'd

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
before everything is the way you'd

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.450
