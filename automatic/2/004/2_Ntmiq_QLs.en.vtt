00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello today i will show with poison 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.220
 I've created a surfer and cryptic as a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.220
 the first to think of sak and 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.740
 Enter www.ni.com ground e mail 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.789
 password you can enter something 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.870
 Great account man charging explained 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.870
 among them 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:05.050
 I've done it's doing 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.050
 log in to the homepage 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.710
 horst 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.750
 can choose by name 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.830
 create horst so that launches your new one 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 ip 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.479
 Make a mark in front of it , too 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.000
 connected 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.510
 so we start poison ivy and the first 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.190
 produced by nine clients 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:56.170
 the port we take the pott 685 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.170
 password start 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:08.440
 Stellmann server matte so give here 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.440
 we the dns name a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.030
 and of course the same port again 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.560
 as with the client test so has the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.490
 test but successful would first 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.490
 unlock the ports 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.240
 that's with every router to laster 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:59.810
 release new board release other 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:03:02.470
 and here are holders import 168 entry 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.470
 already available 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.239
 then that should not be yet 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:13.069
 The problem is of course the same 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.720
 password we use in the client next 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.950
 at system startup states yes the name 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:28.290
 something inconspicuous take windows 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:31.560
 update here in turn manufacture so 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.989
 this way, the surfer still a 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.989
 system or a windows folder 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:43.650
 I like to copy system folders 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.870
 and then the whole text 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.790
 that means the installation is running 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.239
 automatically after the start so 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:02.810
 If you need the kilogram you have to 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:02.810
 you can and generally and save 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.260
 so 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.760
 then you have to cling the whole thing 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.850
 whether scripts 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:29.639
 so we generate a random string we 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.639
 we do the surfer to save crypt crypt 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:44.930
 but we rather find the servers 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.259
 usually at most wm 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.259
 cup
