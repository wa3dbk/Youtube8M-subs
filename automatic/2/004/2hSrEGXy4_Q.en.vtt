00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:34.230 
and the more slits you making it the
more<00:03:04.030> interesting<00:03:04.210> your<00:03:04.720> snowflake<00:03:05.110> will<00:03:05.260> be

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.670 

so<00:03:35.240> then<00:03:35.390> once<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.630> finish<00:03:36.050> cutting<00:03:36.410> out<00:03:36.650> all

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
so then once you finish cutting out all

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.300 
so then once you finish cutting out all
of<00:03:36.920> your<00:03:37.250> slits<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:38.840> open<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.350> flattening<00:03:40.160> it

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
of your slits you open it flattening it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:51.030 
of your slits you open it flattening it
as<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.550> go

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.750 

and<00:03:51.670> then<00:03:51.819> as<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.269> see<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:53.099> have<00:03:54.099> a<00:03:54.280> snowflake

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
and then as you see I have a snowflake

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.000 
and then as you see I have a snowflake
there's<00:03:55.659> some<00:03:55.810> other<00:03:55.959> slip<00:03:56.349> snowflakes<00:03:56.950> that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
there's some other slip snowflakes that

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.350 
there's some other slip snowflakes that
I<00:03:57.159> made<00:03:57.310> earlier<00:03:57.340> today<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.209> your

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
I made earlier today so you have your

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.569 
I made earlier today so you have your
glue<00:04:01.659> and<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.140> paintbrush<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:03.310> dip<00:04:03.459> your

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
glue and a paintbrush you dip your

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.970 
glue and a paintbrush you dip your
paintbrush<00:04:03.879> in<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.239> glue<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:05.500> spread

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
paintbrush in the glue and just spread

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.610 
paintbrush in the glue and just spread
it<00:04:06.099> on<00:04:06.909> the<00:04:06.970> snowflake<00:04:07.930> wherever<00:04:08.319> there's

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
it on the snowflake wherever there's

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.890 
it on the snowflake wherever there's
paper<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:10.000> then<00:04:10.180> when<00:04:10.269> you're<00:04:10.420> done<00:04:10.540> putting

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
paper and then when you're done putting

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.920 
paper and then when you're done putting
the<00:04:11.019> glue<00:04:11.319> on<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:12.340> just<00:04:12.519> wanna<00:04:12.700> shake<00:04:13.690> some

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
the glue on it you just wanna shake some

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:24.020 
the glue on it you just wanna shake some
glitter<00:04:14.230> on<00:04:14.560> top<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.280> that

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.980 

I<00:04:25.880> don't<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.060> cover<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.360> whole<00:04:27.510> thing<00:04:27.540> to

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
I don't want to cover the whole thing to

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:36.380 
I don't want to cover the whole thing to
give<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.380> effect<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:34.260> then<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.910> down<00:04:36.240> with

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
give it the effect so then you down with

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.770 
give it the effect so then you down with
the<00:04:36.510> glitter<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:37.910> shake<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.090> excess<00:04:39.240> glitter

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the glitter you shake the excess glitter

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.930 
the glitter you shake the excess glitter
off<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:42.950> then<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.370> have<00:04:44.610> your

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
off of it and then you have your

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.280 
off of it and then you have your
snowflake<00:04:47.300> there's<00:04:48.300> some<00:04:48.480> other<00:04:48.660> snowflakes

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
snowflake there's some other snowflakes

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.800 
snowflake there's some other snowflakes
that<00:04:49.530> i've<00:04:49.650> glittered<00:04:50.330> when<00:04:51.330> you're<00:04:51.480> finish

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
that i've glittered when you're finish

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.020 
that i've glittered when you're finish
with<00:04:52.260> your<00:04:52.410> snowflake<00:04:52.920> then<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.700> just<00:04:53.850> hang

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
with your snowflake then you just hang

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:06.770 
with your snowflake then you just hang
it<00:04:54.150> up<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.360> your<00:04:54.510> background<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.419> here's<00:05:06.630> the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
it up on your background so here's the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.470 
it up on your background so here's the
finished<00:05:07.050> background
