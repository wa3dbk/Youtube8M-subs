is<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.599> outside<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.940> clip<00:03:25.269> looks<00:03:25.599> like

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
is the outside and the clip looks like

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.979 
is the outside and the clip looks like
it's<00:03:29.190> looks<00:03:30.190> like<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.519> painted<00:03:31.030> here<00:03:31.389> some

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it's looks like it painted here some

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.339 
it's looks like it painted here some
sort<00:03:32.229> of<00:03:32.290> glass<00:03:32.620> finish<00:03:32.979> on<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.540> edges<00:03:34.930> not

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
sort of glass finish on the edges not

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.409 
sort of glass finish on the edges not
too<00:03:35.530> sure<00:03:35.680> if<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:36.010> crap<00:03:36.340> but<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.819> think<00:03:37.299> it

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
too sure if that's crap but I think it

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.680 
too sure if that's crap but I think it
would<00:03:37.599> be<00:03:37.720> painted<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:39.909> can<00:03:40.150> run<00:03:40.299> some

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
would be painted so you can run some

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.640 
would be painted so you can run some
wires<00:03:41.530> through<00:03:42.159> the<00:03:42.310> skies<00:03:43.049> anywhere<00:03:44.049> around

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
wires through the skies anywhere around

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.490 
wires through the skies anywhere around
it<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.849> it's<00:03:45.970> pretty<00:03:46.269> nice<00:03:46.419> family<00:03:46.930> okay<00:03:47.229> skies

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500
