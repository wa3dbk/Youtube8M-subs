 to look for a bit of international understanding 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.929
 can 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.529
 because my ladies and gentlemen here 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.340
 are chimpanzees and what you are in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.810
 Japan Island looks like and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.810
 Sheen can call herself 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.250

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.940
 from tokio 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.460
 in the old imperial city Kyoto distance 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.640
 of 500 kilometers and that's what it takes 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.920
 dance with 300 things 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.940
 two pieces 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.390
 countless draw 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.390
 in the eye 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.549
 come 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.090
 wieland 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.829
 maybe pull 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.299
 Of course this is a sight you 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.299
 Do not just pass by 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.369
 let the holy mountain fuji lies 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.810
 on our way to tomorrow 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.530
 sunrise a bit more accurate 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.240
 look at 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.740
 until then I have me first 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.709
 quartered in a so-called 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.479
 Win a traditional and yes 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.310
 very simple Japanese 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.619
 of course if the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.659
 shoes parked at the entrance and against 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.069
 a few pushes the exchanged for 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.670
 European relations are also almost 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.200
 fit 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.179
 much more interesting , though 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.099
 that the pushes pulled out again 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.399
 if you have to go to the toilet 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:05.349
 because there is actually your own pc load 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.039
 there you can go through a bit 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.039
 to get the wings 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.450
 in mexico 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.060
 free paulis 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.069
 if you really are not a fan of early 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.100
 get up and even moderately from 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.310
 exotic breakfast but if one of the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.550
 fuji and 6 o'clock in the morning in pink 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 then you still have dress 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.780
 definitely seen worse 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.430
 we are tired of it 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.430
 the journey through japan continues like 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.740
 We promised to go to kyoto and have a go 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 old custom will be explored by 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.350
 to have bhs evaluated with soybeans 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.270
 is okay, I'm doing everything 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.100
 I just hope that the dinger trade 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.790
 have consistency as those of the early 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.790
 morning
