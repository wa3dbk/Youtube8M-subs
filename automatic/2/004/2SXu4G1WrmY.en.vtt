00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this review so first of all going over

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
this review so first of all going over
all<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> physical<00:00:50.340> aspects<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.030> tablet

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
all the physical aspects of this tablet

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.689 
all the physical aspects of this tablet
and<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.289> Front<00:00:52.620> evil<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.280> earpiece

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and up on Front evil to your earpiece

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.389 
and up on Front evil to your earpiece
which<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.420> apparently<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.020> speaker<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.800> well<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
which is apparently a speaker as well I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
which is apparently a speaker as well I
mean<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> does<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> earpiece<00:00:57.899> but

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
mean it does look like a earpiece but

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
mean it does look like a earpiece but
due<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> lack<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.980> SIM<00:00:59.160> card<00:00:59.190> slot<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
due to the lack of a SIM card slot I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
due to the lack of a SIM card slot I
wasn't<00:01:00.300> able<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> find<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> good<00:01:00.930> reason<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> use

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
wasn't able to find a good reason to use

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
wasn't able to find a good reason to use
it<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.430> piece<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.730> course<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it as it your piece of course it's a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
it as it your piece of course it's a
damn<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.690> speaker<00:01:04.229> though<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.589> mind<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
damn good speaker though and mind you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
damn good speaker though and mind you
that<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> only<00:01:06.180> speaker<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.630> this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that this is the only speaker in this

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
that this is the only speaker in this
tablet<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.710> expect<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.159> any<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.640> the

streamed<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> shouted<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> price<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
streamed out and shouted if the price of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.679 
streamed out and shouted if the price of
the<00:01:40.290> stab<00:01:40.500> --let<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.860> over<00:01:41.280> $200<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.210> even

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the stab --let was over $200 or even

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.260 
the stab --let was over $200 or even
$100<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.770> matter<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> matter<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
$100 for that matter but as a matter of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.050 
$100 for that matter but as a matter of
fact<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.869> costs<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.729> 77<00:01:47.729> US

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
fact that it costs just about 77 US

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.490 
fact that it costs just about 77 US
dollar<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:49.759> 4849<00:01:50.759> Indian<00:01:51.360> rupees<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> quite

dollar or 4849 Indian rupees it is quite

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
dollar or 4849 Indian rupees it is quite
reasonable<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.850> would<00:01:54.180> say<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
reasonable and I would say that it was a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
reasonable and I would say that it was a
pretty<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.950> move<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.700> pretty<00:01:57.030> damn<00:01:57.299> good

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
pretty good move or pretty damn good

internals than on the display so that

internals than on the display so that
the<00:02:01.590> device<00:02:01.860> performs<00:02:02.310> overall<00:02:02.610> better<00:02:02.880> of

again they're quite manageable and I can

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.670 
again they're quite manageable and I can
just<00:03:28.110> ignore<00:03:28.440> that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
just ignore that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590 
just ignore that

its<00:04:51.280> capabilities<00:04:51.879> I<00:04:51.909> decided<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.599> throw<00:04:52.750> some

light games first and it handled them

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.420 
light games first and it handled them
quite<00:04:55.599> well<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.380> gameplay<00:04:56.740> was<00:04:56.919> moved<00:04:57.220> no

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
quite well the gameplay was moved no

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.189 
quite well the gameplay was moved no
framedrops<00:04:57.669> I<00:04:58.150> was<00:04:58.330> quite<00:04:58.509> a<00:04:58.539> lot<00:04:58.720> impressed

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.640 
course it was able to pull up easily and
till<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.150> point<00:05:07.360> whatever<00:05:07.690> it<00:05:07.930> was<00:05:08.139> I<00:05:08.349> wasn't

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
was handling it as if it wasn't any big

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.309 
was handling it as if it wasn't any big
deal<00:05:27.340> since<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.120> didn't<00:05:28.360> had<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.509> copy<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:28.870> modern

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
deal since I didn't had a copy of modern

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.800 
deal since I didn't had a copy of modern
combat<00:05:29.530> 5<00:05:29.889> I<00:05:30.159> wasn't<00:05:30.580> able<00:05:30.639> to<00:05:30.880> test<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.180> out<00:05:31.300> so

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
combat 5 I wasn't able to test it out so

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.450 
combat 5 I wasn't able to test it out so
I<00:05:31.840> decided<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.349> run<00:05:32.560> an<00:05:32.770> almost<00:05:33.250> similar

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
I decided to run an almost similar

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.430 
I decided to run an almost similar
graphic<00:05:33.969> intense<00:05:34.300> game<00:05:34.539> instead<00:05:35.050> like<00:05:35.289> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
graphic intense game instead like the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.129 
graphic intense game instead like the
dead<00:05:35.620> trigger<00:05:35.830> 2<00:05:35.979> and<00:05:36.400> again<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.719> was<00:05:37.900> all

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
dead trigger 2 and again it was all

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.260 
dead trigger 2 and again it was all
smooth<00:05:38.440> for<00:05:38.680> this<00:05:38.770> guy<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.039> handle<00:05:39.340> now<00:05:40.029> this

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
smooth for this guy to handle now this

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.580 
smooth for this guy to handle now this
is<00:05:40.389> mainly<00:05:40.539> happening<00:05:40.990> because<00:05:41.229> of<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:41.440> low

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
is mainly happening because of the low

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.409 
is mainly happening because of the low
res<00:05:41.800> display<00:05:42.219> which<00:05:42.490> isn't<00:05:42.669> taking<00:05:43.060> up<00:05:43.210> much

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
res display which isn't taking up much

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.330 
res display which isn't taking up much
resources<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.110> get<00:05:44.259> powered<00:05:44.740> so<00:05:45.250> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
resources to get powered so the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.800 
resources to get powered so the
performance<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:45.940> able<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.449> take<00:05:46.630> advantage

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
performance is able to take advantage

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.050 
performance is able to take advantage
instead<00:05:47.469> just<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.190> overall<00:05:48.490> I'm<00:05:48.669> very<00:05:48.729> much
