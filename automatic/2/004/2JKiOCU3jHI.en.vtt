is 95 so let's just move the cars out of
the<00:01:41.939> way<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> give<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.720> quick<00:01:42.840> spin<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the way and give this a quick spin so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.210 
the way and give this a quick spin so
you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.640> ramp<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.780> springy<00:01:46.560> needs<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you can see this ramp is springy needs a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.819 
you can see this ramp is springy needs a
little<00:01:47.549> tightening<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> spring<00:01:48.899> these

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
little tightening on the spring these

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.160 
little tightening on the spring these
two<00:01:50.130> doors<00:01:50.399> here

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
two doors here

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.550 
two doors here
open<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.720> back<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.110> pretty<00:01:55.200> open

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
open up see that the back is pretty open

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920 
open up see that the back is pretty open
so<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.340> tires<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.630> drive<00:01:57.899> right

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so these can tires can just drive right

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.830 
so these can tires can just drive right
through<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:01.079> there's<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> elevators<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
through so there's the elevators over I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
last one it's one two flips

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.140 
last one it's one two flips
let's<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.070> take<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.280> look<00:02:10.460> at<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.730> bottom<00:02:10.910> of
