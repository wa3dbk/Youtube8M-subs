00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.810
 personal hello okay guys youtube 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.170
 everybody who visits the blog is the here 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.530
 teacher andrÃ©'s class today will be about 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.489
 the power supply 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.619
 I'll explain how it works there. 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:22.529
 power supply 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.319
 this class will be more theoretical for you 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.029
 understand the operation of a source 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.309
 this is a source of a computer 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.679
 a source of x 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:35.879
 the next class i will teach how 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:42.179
 test all the source wires as 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:43.410
 She'll see if everything's okay, you 'll plug it in. 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.769
 her on a computer 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 Ok, so the power supply 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.890
 its function is to transform the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.309
 alternating current than the current 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.039
 that you connect the cable 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.210
 is plugged in force here comes 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:07.320
 an alternating current may be 115 or 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.310
 230 bags and the source 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 it has as its function to pick up the chain 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.490
 alternating current input and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.210
 turn into direct current that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 chain leaving the house 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.899
 all the connectors here and beyond to make 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.549
 this alternating current transformation 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.479
 for direct current it has the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.329
 reduce the stresses on the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 electronic components of the motherboard 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.450
 work restraints there from -12 to 12 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.579
 volts 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.369
 she gets the 115 or 230 lowers that 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.710
 voltage and current transformer 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.969
 alternating current for direct current 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.670
 then that is okay source function 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.479
 food 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 here we have the label informing the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.340
 input current to output current 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.930
 nor the tensions arising from 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.629
 her power so we have here 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:25.840
 marking the entrance to the 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:30.680
 alternating current which is 115 230 volts 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.910
 thus sees alternating current voltage and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.790
 this source is 50 to 60 years old 50 reais 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.340
 in the case is the pa in Paraguay is the tension 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.370
 aside the 60 here before 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.610
 brazil and the current in case of fuse 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:53.420
 I do not know how to sambar to 115 and 34 and 30 below 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.500
 I have the output of the current 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.760
 to be continued 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:04.700
 we have there 3.3 volts 5 volts 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:09.680
 the 12 volts or less 12 thousand plus 5 psb 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:15.049
 we have the liberal chains and the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.560
 power which is nothing more attention these 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:22.400
 current that gives power of each 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.040
 attention is that the maximum power to the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.730
 is a generic rich source she has 220 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.670
 Power wattage computer 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.549
 nor is it basically the function 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.919
 source is a downhole transformer 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:43.639
 she gets a high tension and lowers 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:45.819
 receives an alternating voltage and transforms 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:49.760
 in direct current 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.099
 I hope it has been made clear in the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.650
 explanation of the source is that many people 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.959
 who speaks the source the function of it is 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.389
 power all computer parts 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.090
 This we already knowing that you need 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.989
 know that these data are current 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.530
 alternating current and voltage 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.299
 source output voltages 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.780
 in the next classes I will explain how 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.669
 test the source all its components 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.769
 and in the last classes of source we go 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.810
 know within the source all 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.440
 electronic components of 5 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.600
 ok a hug and Professor Andrew to 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.430
 who are watching a video? 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.530
 people who are subscribing to the channel 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.389
 You are talking to me we made a 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.550
 Nice friendship, we're trading. 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.889
 information has a staff that wants 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.980
 make a video there send me it 's with 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.380
 problems on your computer for us 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.419
 to be solving personnel accessing the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.550
 blog that sees the videos in the blog that leaves 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.169
 a comment is following a blog one 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.860
 I hug you there 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.860
 Beauty is more good luck to you guys
