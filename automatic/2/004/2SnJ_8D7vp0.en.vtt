I've<00:00:21.539> said<00:00:21.720> previously<00:00:21.930> before<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:22.800> other

myself and I got to say mitt Israel's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.440 
myself and I got to say mitt Israel's
really<00:00:39.960> strong<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.739> necessarily<00:00:41.430> AP<00:00:42.149> mid

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
really strong now not necessarily AP mid

really strong now not necessarily AP mid
as<00:00:42.660> you're<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.530> foot<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
as you're all but just go foot a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.270 
as you're all but just go foot a
standard<00:00:44.370> ad<00:00:45.149> builds<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:45.750> another<00:00:46.710> update<00:00:47.160> as

standard ad builds now another update as

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970

well<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.820> you're<00:00:48.030> apparently<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.930> talked<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
well and as you're apparently I talked a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.189 
well and as you're apparently I talked a
bit<00:00:50.190> too<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.670> towards<00:00:51.210> blue<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.020> now

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
bit too down towards blue as you all now

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
bit too down towards blue as you all now
I<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.120> wrong<00:00:54.270> as

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I was kind of right and I was wrong as

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.439 
I was kind of right and I was wrong as
well<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.920> reason<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.370> why<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
well the reason as to why I was right is

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.049 
well the reason as to why I was right is
because<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.559> obviously<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.609> strong

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
because it's obviously not very strong

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
because it's obviously not very strong
in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.840> early<00:01:01.199> game<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.609> 80<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.750> real<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
in the early game but 80 as real if you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
in the early game but 80 as real if you
want<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.430> late<00:01:05.700> game<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.299> Israel<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
want good late game with Israel when you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.399 
want good late game with Israel when you
have<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.680> blue<00:01:07.950> build

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
will suffer if you get something like a

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.980 
will suffer if you get something like a
tier<00:01:29.590> because<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:31.030> may<00:01:31.240> not<00:01:31.450> seem<00:01:31.750> like<00:01:31.810> much

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
tier because it may not seem like much

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.319 
tier because it may not seem like much
that's<00:01:32.560> 700<00:01:33.009> gold<00:01:33.219> but<00:01:33.459> it<00:01:33.579> does<00:01:33.729> put<00:01:33.969> you<00:01:34.030> back

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
that's 700 gold but it does put you back

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.149 
that's 700 gold but it does put you back
a<00:01:34.359> bit<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:35.109> know<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:35.319> can<00:01:35.469> spend<00:01:35.709> that<00:01:35.859> God<00:01:36.039> on

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
a bit you know you can spend that God on

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.249 
a bit you know you can spend that God on
something<00:01:36.490> like<00:01:36.609> a<00:01:36.670> pickaxe<00:01:37.209> or<00:01:37.509> working

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
you just have to accept the fact that

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
you just have to accept the fact that
you're<00:01:51.909> gonna<00:01:52.090> be<00:01:52.270> doing<00:01:52.539> shitty<00:01:52.840> early<00:01:53.200> game

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you're gonna be doing shitty early game

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.169 
you're gonna be doing shitty early game
when<00:01:56.020> usually<00:01:56.439> has<00:01:56.739> really<00:01:57.099> strong<00:01:57.819> early

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
when usually has really strong early

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.240 
when usually has really strong early
game<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.719> you<00:01:58.899> get<00:01:59.140> something<00:01:59.590> like<00:01:59.739> a<00:01:59.890> sheen

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
game if you get something like a sheen

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.119 
game if you get something like a sheen
or<00:02:00.489> whatever<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.170> extra<00:02:02.409> pot<00:02:02.739> damage

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
but yeah I'm just going to stop you into

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.749 
but yeah I'm just going to stop you into
I<00:02:04.869> repeat<00:02:05.289> myself<00:02:05.709> so<00:02:06.189> when<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.369> ways<00:02:06.489> mid

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
I repeat myself so when I ways mid

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.869 
I repeat myself so when I ways mid
Israel<00:02:07.470> considering<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> facts<00:02:08.859> thats<00:02:09.220> he's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
Israel considering the facts thats he's

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.449 
Israel considering the facts thats he's
such<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.119> safe<00:02:10.539> bit<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.079> mid<00:02:11.799> lane<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.220> so

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
such a safe bit like mid lane is so

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.000 
such a safe bit like mid lane is so
small<00:02:12.940> basically<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.019> can<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.349> use<00:02:14.590> your

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
small basically you can just use your

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.559 
small basically you can just use your
arcane<00:02:15.400> shift<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.940> you're<00:02:16.060> already<00:02:16.239> at<00:02:16.420> your

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
arcane shift that you're already at your

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.900 
arcane shift that you're already at your
tower<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.680> super<00:02:18.040> safe<00:02:18.280> than<00:02:18.579> in<00:02:18.849> that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
tower so it's super safe than in that

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.680 
tower so it's super safe than in that
sense<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.549> because<00:02:21.549> he's<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.970> know<00:02:22.000> he's<00:02:22.120> got

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
sense and because he's you know he's got

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.960 
sense and because he's you know he's got
a<00:02:23.049> lot<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.440> AD<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.069> build<00:02:24.250> him<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.579> d<00:02:24.639> you've

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
a lot of AD if you build him a d you've

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.879 
a lot of AD if you build him a d you've
obviously<00:02:25.120> got<00:02:25.450> plenty<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.840> attack<00:02:26.709> damage

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:26.889 
obviously got plenty of attack damage

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.370 
obviously got plenty of attack damage
last<00:02:27.280> hit<00:02:27.519> easily<00:02:27.880> over<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.450> enemy<00:02:28.780> laner<00:02:29.049> and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
last hit easily over the enemy laner and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.710 
last hit easily over the enemy laner and
of<00:02:29.889> course<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.190> could<00:02:30.340> always<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.700> win<00:02:31.329> trades

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
of course you could always so win trades

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.170 
of course you could always so win trades
with<00:02:31.959> your<00:02:32.109> mystic<00:02:32.470> shot<00:02:32.880> does<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> lot<00:02:34.120> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
with your mystic shot does a lot of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.479 
with your mystic shot does a lot of
damage<00:02:34.419> physical<00:02:35.260> damage<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.889> you<00:02:36.370> know

damage physical damage and you know

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.370 
damage physical damage and you know
you've<00:02:36.639> just<00:02:36.849> naturally<00:02:37.269> got<00:02:37.450> your<00:02:37.840> attack

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
you've just naturally got your attack

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.050 
you've just naturally got your attack
speed<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.829> a<00:02:39.040> tank<00:02:39.280> damage<00:02:39.579> so<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.790> could<00:02:39.910> win

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
speed in a tank damage so you could win

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.789 
speed in a tank damage so you could win
trades<00:02:40.359> alright<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.169> if<00:02:41.230> something<00:02:41.500> goes

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
trades alright and if something goes

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.319 
trades alright and if something goes
south<00:02:41.829> you<00:02:42.280> could<00:02:42.400> just<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.730> can't<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.090> doubt

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
south you could just I can't you doubt

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.500 
south you could just I can't you doubt
so<00:02:43.630> pretty<00:02:43.840> much

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
so pretty much

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.470 
so pretty much
mid<00:02:45.110> edgell<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.739> super<00:02:46.189> safe<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.090> farm

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
mid edgell it's super safe you can farm

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.050 
mid edgell it's super safe you can farm
better<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.250> overall<00:02:49.250> I've<00:02:49.519> just<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.970> just

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
better and overall I've just I just

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.670 
better and overall I've just I just
think<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.510> MIT<00:02:50.689> as<00:02:50.870> y'all<00:02:51.049> is<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.470> good

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
think that MIT as y'all is really good

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.309 
think that MIT as y'all is really good
it's<00:02:51.860> really<00:02:51.950> strong<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.079> accept

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
it's really strong you have to accept

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.509 
it's really strong you have to accept
the<00:02:54.439> fact<00:02:54.500> though<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:54.920> as<00:02:55.040> well<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.430> you're

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
the fact though you as well that you're

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.179 
the fact though you as well that you're
not<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.120> any<00:02:56.450> am<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.349> as<00:02:57.470> well<00:02:57.620> but

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
not going to have any am in as well but

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.740 
not going to have any am in as well but
you<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.489> compensate<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.360> having<00:02:59.569> like

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
you can compensate that for having like

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.920 
you can compensate that for having like
a<00:02:59.780> AP<00:03:00.439> jungler<00:03:00.980> or<00:03:01.190> AP<00:03:01.640> top<00:03:01.940> lane<00:03:02.180> or<00:03:02.599> maybe

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
a AP jungler or AP top lane or maybe

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.289 
a AP jungler or AP top lane or maybe
even<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.290> support<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:04.010> adding<00:03:04.819> or<00:03:04.940> something

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
even a support like adding or something

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.369 
even a support like adding or something
who<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.599> do<00:03:05.659> a<00:03:05.720> bit<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:06.140> pea<00:03:06.319> damage<00:03:07.209> so

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
who can do a bit of a pea damage so

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.559 
who can do a bit of a pea damage so
that's<00:03:09.379> just<00:03:09.560> my<00:03:09.680> thoughts<00:03:09.980> anyways<00:03:10.359> how<00:03:11.359> am<00:03:11.510> I
