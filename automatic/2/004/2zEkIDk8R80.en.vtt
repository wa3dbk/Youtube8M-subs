00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
a closer look at the Pentagon thief he

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.280 
a closer look at the Pentagon thief he
looks<00:00:39.010> very<00:00:39.100> similar<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.820> that<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.149> Clark<00:00:40.660> from

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
looks very similar to that of Clark from

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.870 
looks very similar to that of Clark from
the<00:00:41.410> campaign<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.220> incorrect<00:00:42.610> he<00:00:42.790> is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
the campaign but that is incorrect he is

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.970 
the campaign but that is incorrect he is
not<00:00:43.120> dr.<00:00:43.510> Clark<00:00:43.780> for<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.260> variety<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.860> reasons

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
not dr. Clark for a variety of reasons

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.069 
not dr. Clark for a variety of reasons
the<00:00:45.340> first<00:00:45.489> reason<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.910> campaign<00:00:46.540> characters

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
the first reason is campaign characters

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.810 
the first reason is campaign characters
while<00:00:47.649> they<00:00:47.800> have<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.130> same<00:00:48.310> character

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
while they have the same character

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.030 
while they have the same character
models<00:00:49.120> do<00:00:49.510> not<00:00:49.540> carry<00:00:50.080> over<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.440> call<00:00:50.740> of<00:00:50.830> duty

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
models do not carry over to call of duty

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.250 
models do not carry over to call of duty
zombies<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.580> is<00:00:51.700> not<00:00:51.910> what<00:00:52.180> happens<00:00:52.600> now

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
zombies that is not what happens now

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.790 
zombies that is not what happens now
Clark<00:00:54.160> himself<00:00:54.850> it's<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.510> car<00:00:55.780> Clark's<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.290> not

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
Clark himself it's a car Clark's I not

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800 
Clark himself it's a car Clark's I not
in<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.220> depending<00:00:57.580> on<00:00:57.580> thief<00:00:57.850> what<00:00:58.480> he<00:00:58.630> has

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
in it so depending on thief what he has

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.360 
in it so depending on thief what he has
gone<00:00:59.020> bottom<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.530> he<00:00:59.650> is<00:00:59.740> a<00:00:59.770> bunch<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.130> numbers

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
gone bottom is he is a bunch of numbers

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.460 
gone bottom is he is a bunch of numbers
but<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.150> main<00:01:01.360> thing<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.930> importance

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
but the main thing of importance

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.560 
but the main thing of importance
regarding<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.490> the<00:01:03.610> Pentagon<00:01:03.880> thief<00:01:04.329> is<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
regarding to the Pentagon thief is the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.990 
regarding to the Pentagon thief is the
fact<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.290> when<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.770> five<00:01:06.009> map<00:01:06.310> takes<00:01:06.610> place

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
fact that when the five map takes place

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.240 
fact that when the five map takes place
and<00:01:07.270> what<00:01:07.840> map<00:01:08.049> takes<00:01:08.320> place<00:01:08.619> at<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> exact

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
and what map takes place at the exact

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.999 
and what map takes place at the exact
same<00:01:09.490> time<00:01:10.170> ascension<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:11.650> correct<00:01:11.799> the

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
same time ascension that is correct the

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.830 
same time ascension that is correct the
Ascension<00:01:12.460> map<00:01:12.610> takes<00:01:12.880> place<00:01:13.150> at<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.420> exact

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
Ascension map takes place at the exact

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.190 
Ascension map takes place at the exact
same<00:01:14.079> time<00:01:14.380> as<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:15.430> five<00:01:15.700> map<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.600> as<00:01:16.869> many<00:01:17.079> of

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
same time as the five map so as many of

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.870 
same time as the five map so as many of
you<00:01:17.350> may<00:01:17.409> know<00:01:17.649> an<00:01:17.770> ascension<00:01:18.250> there's<00:01:18.759> a

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
you may know an ascension there's a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.490 
you may know an ascension there's a
certain<00:01:19.240> easter<00:01:19.720> egg<00:01:19.870> on<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.290> have<00:01:20.380> to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
certain easter egg on what you have to

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.820 
certain easter egg on what you have to
save<00:01:20.770> gersh<00:01:21.190> from<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> ether<00:01:22.570> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
save gersh from the ether and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.140 
save gersh from the ether and
essentially<00:01:23.830> what<00:01:24.010> happens<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.520> Yuri<00:01:24.820> goes

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
essentially what happens is Yuri goes

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.170 
essentially what happens is Yuri goes
crazy<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.780> Samantha<00:01:26.440> get<00:01:26.620> rid<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.159> e<00:01:27.220> via

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
crazy and Samantha get rid of your e via

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.180 
crazy and Samantha get rid of your e via
teleporting<00:01:29.050> him<00:01:29.260> or<00:01:29.470> essentially<00:01:30.040> just

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
teleporting him or essentially just

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.100 
teleporting him or essentially just
getting<00:01:30.520> rid<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.729> him<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.330> when<00:01:31.510> Yuri<00:01:31.780> goes

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
getting rid of him so when Yuri goes

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.230 
getting rid of him so when Yuri goes
insane<00:01:32.650> so<00:01:33.010> essentially<00:01:33.370> Yuri<00:01:33.670> goes<00:01:33.880> insane

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
insane so essentially Yuri goes insane

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.660 
insane so essentially Yuri goes insane
Samantha<00:01:35.080> Max's<00:01:35.440> gets<00:01:35.680> sick<00:01:36.010> of<00:01:36.190> your<00:01:36.430> EAD

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
Samantha Max's gets sick of your EAD

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.270 
Samantha Max's gets sick of your EAD

when the other people arrive in

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.210 
when the other people arrive in
Ascension<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.260> that<00:01:47.380> would<00:01:47.500> make<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.770> direct

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
Ascension so that would make a direct

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.590 
Ascension so that would make a direct
tie<00:01:48.400> between<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.850> two<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.119> how<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.299> people

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
tie between the two and how the people

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.690 
tie between the two and how the people
in<00:01:49.869> Ascension<00:01:50.350> could<00:01:50.770> hear<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.190> people<00:01:51.369> at

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
in Ascension could hear the people at

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.520 
in Ascension could hear the people at
five<00:01:51.940> now<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.390> would<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.869> mean<00:01:53.140> right<00:01:53.380> all

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
five now this would be to mean right all

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.710 
five now this would be to mean right all
since<00:01:53.740> 27<00:01:54.130> i'll<00:01:54.220> link<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.430> below<00:01:54.549> he<00:01:55.479> thought

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
since 27 i'll link it below he thought

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.020 
since 27 i'll link it below he thought
of<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.020> after<00:01:56.830> like<00:01:57.220> researching<00:01:57.760> and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
of it after like researching and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.190 
of it after like researching and
thinking<00:01:58.060> about<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.510> just<00:01:58.600> makes<00:01:58.810> clear

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
thinking about it just makes clear

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.230 
thinking about it just makes clear
perfect<00:01:59.650> sense<00:01:59.860> right<00:01:59.950> now<00:02:00.189> guys<00:02:00.400> because<00:02:00.820> if

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
perfect sense right now guys because if

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.700 
perfect sense right now guys because if
you<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.630> overall<00:02:02.110> just<00:02:02.290> think<00:02:02.470> about<00:02:02.560> how

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
you just overall just think about how

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.420 
you just overall just think about how
impactful<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.150> five<00:02:04.390> map<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:05.860> not<00:02:06.250> that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
impactful the five map is it's not that

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.029 
impactful the five map is it's not that
impactful<00:02:06.790> storyline<00:02:07.240> wise<00:02:07.390> having<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.409> we

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
impactful storyline wise having this we

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.070 
impactful storyline wise having this we
clearly<00:02:09.549> make<00:02:09.909> it<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.149> lot<00:02:10.360> more<00:02:10.539> important

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
clearly make it a lot more important

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.759 
clearly make it a lot more important
because<00:02:11.500> Yuri<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.670> Samantha<00:02:13.540> are<00:02:13.569> both<00:02:14.319> that

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
because Yuri and Samantha are both that

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.289 
because Yuri and Samantha are both that
they<00:02:15.010> both<00:02:15.189> essentially<00:02:15.819> have<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.150> little

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
they both essentially have this little

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.149 
they both essentially have this little
bit<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.599> crazy<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.170> them<00:02:17.379> but<00:02:17.769> at<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> same

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
bit of crazy to them but at the same

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.030 
bit of crazy to them but at the same
time<00:02:18.310> urien<00:02:18.879> gersh<00:02:19.150> are<00:02:19.450> both<00:02:19.930> manipulated<00:02:20.799> by

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
time urien gersh are both manipulated by

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.580 
time urien gersh are both manipulated by
Samantha<00:02:21.790> Yuri<00:02:22.060> goes<00:02:22.269> crazy<00:02:22.629> from<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.080> gersh

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
Samantha Yuri goes crazy from it gersh

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.679 
Samantha Yuri goes crazy from it gersh
ends<00:02:23.889> up<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.129> victim<00:02:24.159> from<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.510> when

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
ends up the victim from it and so when

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.599 
ends up the victim from it and so when
gersh<00:02:25.900> goes<00:02:26.169> into<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> gersh<00:02:26.919> device<00:02:27.279> going

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
gersh goes into the gersh device going

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.190 
gersh goes into the gersh device going
into<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.060> ether<00:02:28.480> samee

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
into the ether samee

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.720 
into the ether samee
then<00:02:29.440> essentially<00:02:29.800> comes<00:02:30.129> out<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.459> kills

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
then essentially comes out and kills

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.790 
then essentially comes out and kills
everyone<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.720> obviously<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> game

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
everyone now obviously in the game

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.460 
everyone now obviously in the game
that's<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.550> reverse<00:02:33.700> way<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.750> having<00:02:35.260> this

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that's the reverse way but having this

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.190 
that's the reverse way but having this
in<00:02:35.800> this<00:02:35.950> specific<00:02:36.190> point<00:02:36.879> having<00:02:37.360> Samantha

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
in this specific point having Samantha

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.680 
in this specific point having Samantha
send<00:02:38.980> your<00:02:39.250> ease<00:02:39.430> body<00:02:39.670> into<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.090> five<00:02:40.390> or

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
send your ease body into the five or

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.229 
send your ease body into the five or
even<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:41.530> gersh<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:42.129> in<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.519> five<00:02:42.730> depending

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
even have gersh be in the five depending

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.970 
even have gersh be in the five depending
on<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.810> Pentagon<00:02:44.140> thief<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:44.890> our

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
on the Pentagon thief and then our

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.949 
on the Pentagon thief and then our
characters<00:02:45.340> having<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.670> save<00:02:45.880> makes<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.599> lot<00:02:46.930> of

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
characters having to save makes a lot of

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.229 
characters having to save makes a lot of
sense<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:47.860> makes<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.220> direct<00:02:48.819> tie

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
sense and just makes the direct tie

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.809 
sense and just makes the direct tie
between<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.840> two<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.080> them<00:02:50.310> cursors<00:02:51.310> voice<00:02:51.550> is

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
between the two of them cursors voice is

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.640 
between the two of them cursors voice is
through<00:02:52.090> some<00:02:52.360> form<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.720> technology<00:02:53.380> things

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
through some form of technology things

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.620 
through some form of technology things
like<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.310> obviously<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:55.299> he's<00:02:55.510> in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
like that so it's obviously that he's in

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.170 
like that so it's obviously that he's in
the<00:02:55.720> casimir<00:02:56.200> mechanism<00:02:56.799> but<00:02:57.310> uh<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:58.150> just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
the casimir mechanism but uh it just

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.000 
the casimir mechanism but uh it just
makes<00:02:58.599> sense<00:02:58.900> for<00:02:59.080> URI<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.440> be<00:02:59.680> there<00:02:59.830> now

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
makes sense for URI to be there now

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.320 
makes sense for URI to be there now
there<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> variety<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.819> different<00:03:00.910> ways

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
there are a variety of different ways

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.940 
there are a variety of different ways
that<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.690> could<00:03:01.810> go<00:03:01.989> there<00:03:02.410> are<00:03:02.560> certainly<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
that it could go there are certainly a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.410 
that it could go there are certainly a
lot<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.400> other<00:03:03.519> characters<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.269> could<00:03:04.390> be

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
lot of other characters that it could be

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.539 
lot of other characters that it could be
but<00:03:05.170> for<00:03:05.349> me<00:03:05.470> personally<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.160> just<00:03:06.340> seems

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
but for me personally it just seems

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.729 
but for me personally it just seems
logical<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.599> have<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.959> lot<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.470> cool

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
logical and to have a lot of cool

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.940 
logical and to have a lot of cool
storyline<00:03:09.280> sense<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:10.750> now

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
storyline sense for it to be that now

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.170 
storyline sense for it to be that now
obviously<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.130> mess<00:03:12.340> not<00:03:12.519> solidified<00:03:13.030> this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
obviously this mess not solidified this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.110 
obviously this mess not solidified this
is<00:03:13.329> not<00:03:13.480> actual<00:03:13.900> fact<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.920> then<00:03:15.549> again<00:03:15.579> what

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
is not actual fact but then again what

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.970 
is not actual fact but then again what
if<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.360> storyline<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.930> actual<00:03:17.319> fact<00:03:17.560> versus

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
if the storyline is actual fact versus

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.319 
if the storyline is actual fact versus
what<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.519> belief<00:03:18.819> from<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.120> community

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
what is just belief from the community

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.690 
what is just belief from the community
based<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.930> what<00:03:20.019> rarities<00:03:20.290> giving<00:03:20.709> us<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.430> if
