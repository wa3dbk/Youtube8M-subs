her<00:01:34.650> selves<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.670> India<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.450> never<00:01:36.630> know

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
her selves but India and we never know

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.620 
her selves but India and we never know
that's<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.590> her<00:01:37.710> brother<00:01:38.040> did<00:01:38.369> back<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.000> 2006

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that's what her brother did back in 2006

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
that's what her brother did back in 2006
he<00:01:39.990> were<00:01:40.409> he<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.860> determined<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.400> fight<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
he were he was determined to fight but

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.520 
he were he was determined to fight but
in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> end<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:42.509> saw<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> procedures

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
in the end he saw that the procedures

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200 
in the end he saw that the procedures
brought<00:01:43.740> against<00:01:44.040> him<00:01:44.189> were<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.729> fair<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> him

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
brought against him were not fair to him

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
brought against him were not fair to him
and<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.509> he<00:01:45.630> left<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.079> has<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and so he left but has not the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.280 
and so he left but has not the
corruption<00:01:47.939> allegations<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.140> rice

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
corruption allegations and the rice

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.679 
corruption allegations and the rice
subsidy<00:01:49.500> scheme<00:01:49.710> damaged<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.880> party<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
subsidy scheme damaged the party because

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
subsidy scheme damaged the party because
there<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> apparently<00:01:52.950> there's<00:01:53.100> evidence

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there is apparently there's evidence

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
there is apparently there's evidence
that<00:01:53.790> links<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.750> only<00:01:55.020> we've<00:01:55.170> seen<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that links not only we've seen the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.170 
that links not only we've seen the
stockpiling<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> rice<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.610> also<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.030> people

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
stockpiling of rice but also that people

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.730 
stockpiling of rice but also that people
within<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> government<00:01:57.899> her<00:01:58.350> government

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
within the government her government

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
within the government her government
benefited<00:01:59.399> from<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> scheme<00:01:59.820> III<00:02:00.719> said<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
benefited from the scheme III said to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
benefited from the scheme III said to
the<00:02:01.619> contrary<00:02:01.799> I've<00:02:02.310> tried<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:02.969> for

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the contrary I've tried to look for

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.300 
the contrary I've tried to look for
evidence<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.750> basically<00:02:04.500> points<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
evidence that basically points to the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.600 
evidence that basically points to the
benefits<00:02:05.790> gained<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.630> from<00:02:07.200> her<00:02:07.350> from<00:02:08.280> people

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
benefits gained out from her from people

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.279 
benefits gained out from her from people
within<00:02:08.789> her<00:02:08.940> government<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> only

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
within her government I think the only

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
within her government I think the only
specific<00:02:11.039> case<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.370> saw<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> case<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
specific case we saw was the case that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.580 
specific case we saw was the case that
was<00:02:12.360> filed<00:02:12.660> just

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
was filed just

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
was filed just
one<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:13.890> two<00:02:14.010> days<00:02:14.190> before<00:02:14.430> Yingluck's<00:02:15.030> was

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
one or two days before Yingluck's was

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.970 
one or two days before Yingluck's was
impeached<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.170> haven't<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
impeached and we haven't really got to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.770 
impeached and we haven't really got to
the<00:02:17.069> evidence<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.819> what<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.480> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the evidence of that what I think is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
the evidence of that what I think is
important<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.560> remember<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> what

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
important to remember here is that what

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.180 
important to remember here is that what
happened<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> brother<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.200> 2006<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
happened to a brother back in 2006 is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.369 
happened to a brother back in 2006 is
that<00:02:23.370> he<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.879> brought<00:02:24.150> charges<00:02:24.810> under<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
that he was brought charges under the

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.290 
that he was brought charges under the
military<00:02:25.680> coup<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.129> what<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.940> at<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:27.209> he's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
military coup and what look at what he's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.729 
military coup and what look at what he's
become<00:02:27.629> now<00:02:27.810> he's<00:02:27.989> become<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.379> political

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
become now he's become a political

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.000 
become now he's become a political
martyr<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.819> Thai<00:02:30.000> people<00:02:30.239> he<00:02:30.780> doesn't

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
martyr for the Thai people he doesn't

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.110 
martyr for the Thai people he doesn't
disappear<00:02:32.010> from<00:02:32.190> Thai<00:02:32.430> political<00:02:32.640> scene<00:02:33.000> he

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
disappear from Thai political scene he

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
disappear from Thai political scene he
remains<00:02:33.390> even<00:02:33.569> more<00:02:33.930> dominant<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.470> relevant

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
remains even more dominant and relevant

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
remains even more dominant and relevant
and<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.060> cooked<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.540> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and I think that it's cooked that is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.850 
and I think that it's cooked that is
possibly<00:02:37.049> something<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.500> will<00:02:37.590> happen<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
possibly something that will happen to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.650 
possibly something that will happen to
you<00:02:37.950> o'clock<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.310> well<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.730> let's<00:02:38.970> look<00:02:39.239> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you o'clock as well but let's look to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.360 
you o'clock as well but let's look to
the<00:02:39.930> next<00:02:40.049> few<00:02:40.349> months<00:02:40.470> even<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> next<00:02:41.040> few

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the next few months even the next few

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.190 
the next few months even the next few
years<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.180> military<00:02:42.330> wants<00:02:43.049> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
years because the military wants to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.780 
years because the military wants to
bring<00:02:43.379> stability<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.160> country<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.610> some

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
bring stability to the country and some

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.160 
bring stability to the country and some
would<00:02:44.940> argue<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.239> they<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.750> done<00:02:46.110> that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
would argue that they have done that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.440 
would argue that they have done that
there<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.040> meant<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.579> new<00:02:47.819> constitution

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
there is meant to be a new constitution

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.089 
there is meant to be a new constitution
though<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.780> elections<00:02:49.319> when<00:02:49.709> do<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.950> see

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
though and elections when do you see

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.650 
though and elections when do you see
that<00:02:50.250> happening<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.849> think<00:02:51.239> they're<00:02:51.360> gonna<00:02:51.450> try

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that happening I think they're gonna try

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.710 
that happening I think they're gonna try
to<00:02:51.750> keep<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:53.130> timetable<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.239> schedule

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
to keep the the timetable to schedule

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.539 
to keep the the timetable to schedule
we're<00:02:55.019> gonna<00:02:55.110> see<00:02:55.349> election<00:02:55.920> early<00:02:56.190> next<00:02:56.400> year

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
we're gonna see election early next year

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.850 
we're gonna see election early next year
no<00:02:56.819> doubt<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.750> don't<00:02:58.019> think<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.410> election

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
no doubt but I don't think that election

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.470 
no doubt but I don't think that election
will<00:02:59.010> produce<00:02:59.160> any<00:02:59.519> democratic<00:03:00.329> environment

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
will produce any democratic environment

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.750 
will produce any democratic environment
first<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.590> foremost<00:03:01.950> we're<00:03:02.160> gonna<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.549> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
first and foremost we're gonna see a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.729 
first and foremost we're gonna see a
dominant<00:03:03.450> party<00:03:03.780> being<00:03:03.959> struggle<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.470> find<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
dominant party being struggle to find a

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.530 
dominant party being struggle to find a
new<00:03:04.860> leader<00:03:05.099> second<00:03:05.879> of<00:03:06.000> all<00:03:06.090> we're<00:03:06.209> gonna<00:03:06.299> see

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
new leader second of all we're gonna see

to<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.280> courts<00:03:59.639> or<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.849> independent

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
