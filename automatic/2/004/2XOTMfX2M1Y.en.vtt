second in yeah
but<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> wasn't<00:00:19.800> putting<00:00:20.189> too<00:00:20.520> much<00:00:20.670> pressure

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
but I wasn't putting too much pressure

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.679 
but I wasn't putting too much pressure
on<00:00:21.300> myself<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.930> think<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:24.090> didn't<00:00:24.390> want<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> go

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
on myself I think I I didn't want to go

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.480 
on myself I think I I didn't want to go
in<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> mentality<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.920> whatever

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
in with the mentality that whatever

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.410 
in with the mentality that whatever
happens<00:00:26.880> happens

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
happens happens

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
happens happens
because<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.500> that's<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.949> good

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
because I don't think that's a good

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040 
because I don't think that's a good
mentality<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> knew<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> end

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
mentality to have but I knew at the end

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
mentality to have but I knew at the end
of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> day<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.130> only<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.579> best<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
of the day you can only do your best and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.370 
of the day you can only do your best and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
if it doesn't work out it doesn't work

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.940 
if it doesn't work out it doesn't work
out<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.219> also<00:00:35.760> knew<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.450> wanted<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
out but I also knew that I wanted to
make<00:00:37.950> everything<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.790> possibly<00:00:38.969> could<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.870> put

make everything I possibly could to put

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
make everything I possibly could to put
myself<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> best<00:00:40.790> position<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.820> win

myself in the best position to win

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
myself in the best position to win

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
because I knew that this was a

expected that so everyone everyone
seemed<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.979> brought<00:01:14.220> their<00:01:14.490> whole<00:01:14.670> town

crazy yeah but I probably had the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.789 
crazy yeah but I probably had the
smallest<00:01:19.140> rail<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.939> anyone<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.470> it

second day I had lunch with some of my
friends<00:02:26.110> who<00:02:26.260> are<00:02:26.290> we're<00:02:26.980> also<00:02:27.690> coaching<00:02:28.690> me

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
friends who are we're also coaching me

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.140 
friends who are we're also coaching me
and<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:30.730> discussed<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:32.490> what<00:02:33.490> Felix<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
and we discussed what what Felix and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.760 
and we discussed what what Felix and
that<00:02:34.360> George's<00:02:34.750> game<00:02:34.959> plan<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:35.350> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.620> be

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
that George's game plan was going to be

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.690 
that George's game plan was going to be
and<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:36.100> we<00:02:36.850> could<00:02:37.170> apply<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.410> or<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:39.489> game

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and so we could apply that or to my game

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.500 
and so we could apply that or to my game
plan<00:02:39.940> as<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:41.739> find<00:02:42.250> out<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> best<00:02:42.940> best

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
plan as to find out what the best best

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.350 
plan as to find out what the best best
approach<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:45.000> how<00:02:46.000> we<00:02:46.060> were<00:02:46.239> gonna

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
approach would be and how we were gonna

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.270 
approach would be and how we were gonna
win<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.750> thing<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.230> don't<00:02:47.380> know<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:48.070> was

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
win this thing I don't know if it was

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.270 
win this thing I don't know if it was
the<00:02:48.580> opponents<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.239> my<00:02:49.420> choice<00:02:49.690> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the opponents of my choice and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.990 
the opponents of my choice and
necessarily<00:02:51.280> by<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.790> yeah<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.790> is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
necessarily by that yeah it is it is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.720 
necessarily by that yeah it is it is
what<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.750> now<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.980> get<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.190> focus<00:02:57.580> on

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
what it is and now just get a focus on

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.580 
what it is and now just get a focus on
these<00:02:57.850> two<00:02:57.910> opponents<00:02:58.690> because<00:02:58.750> no<00:02:59.110> nothing

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
these two opponents because no nothing

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580 
these two opponents because no nothing
else<00:02:59.770> matters<00:03:00.130> at<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.520> point<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.410> had<00:03:02.560> a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
else matters at this point and I had a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
else matters at this point and I had a
pretty<00:03:03.340> decent<00:03:03.550> stack<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:05.020> work<00:03:05.230> with<00:03:05.470> so

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
pretty decent stack to to work with so

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.520 
pretty decent stack to to work with so
but<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.150> knew<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.750> at<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.110> point<00:03:08.290> like

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
but I knew that at this point like

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.259 
but I knew that at this point like
anything<00:03:08.950> could<00:03:09.100> happen<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.820> know<00:03:09.940> playing

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
anything could happen you know playing

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.970 
anything could happen you know playing
three<00:03:10.570> ended<00:03:10.930> there's<00:03:11.170> there's<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.680> lot<00:03:11.830> of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
three ended there's there's a lot of

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.030 
three ended there's there's a lot of
variance<00:03:12.280> involved<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.769> yeah<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.799> was

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
variance involved and that yeah I was

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.250 
variance involved and that yeah I was
just<00:03:15.220> really<00:03:15.610> excited<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.239> see<00:03:16.720> how<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.989> played

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
just really excited to see how it played

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.460 
just really excited to see how it played

the screen I see the 10 in the window

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.660

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
know that he he's drawing pretty pretty

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.759 
know that he he's drawing pretty pretty
thin<00:03:36.250> at<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.549> point<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.930> walk<00:03:38.380> over<00:03:38.560> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
thin at this point so I I walk over and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.190 
thin at this point so I I walk over and
shake<00:03:39.310> felix<00:03:39.700> hand<00:03:39.940> because<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.330> know<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.780> my

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
shake felix hand because I know that my

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.509 
shake felix hand because I know that my
rail<00:03:41.440> was<00:03:41.620> probably<00:03:41.920> against<00:03:42.220> toward<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
rail was probably against toward the

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.880 
rail was probably against toward the
table<00:03:42.700> then<00:03:43.269> all<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.780> sudden<00:03:44.049> it's<00:03:44.440> all<00:03:44.590> over

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
table then all of a sudden it's all over

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.590 
table then all of a sudden it's all over
and<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.299> fails<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:48.760> was<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.480> was<00:03:49.510> a

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
really weird moment for me because I'd

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.160 
really weird moment for me because I'd
been<00:03:51.790> focusing<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:52.540> hard<00:03:52.570> for<00:03:53.019> this

slowly<00:05:16.130> starting<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.670> realize<00:05:17.090> that<00:05:17.860> I

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
slowly starting to realize that I

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.190 
slowly starting to realize that I
actually<00:05:19.070> won<00:05:19.550> but<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> never<00:05:20.330> got<00:05:21.020> that
