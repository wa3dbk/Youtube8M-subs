always you know just pick up a new
battery<00:01:31.280> door<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.909> swap<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.080> out<00:01:33.260> if<00:01:33.800> you

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
battery door and swap that out if you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.940

choose<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.130> do<00:01:34.370> so<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:35.500> that's<00:01:36.500> pretty<00:01:36.740> much<00:01:36.830> it

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
choose to do so so that's pretty much it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.060 
choose to do so so that's pretty much it
for<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.460> device<00:01:38.060> itself<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.890> can<00:01:40.040> see

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
for the device itself you can see

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.510 
for the device itself you can see
nothing<00:01:40.460> fancy<00:01:40.790> there<00:01:40.960> q10<00:01:41.960> q10<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.220> we'll<00:01:43.460> go

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
ahead and check out the contents real

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.469 
ahead and check out the contents real
quick<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.710> once<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:45.950> pop<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.310> open<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:47.299> our

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
and things like that I'm not sure if

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.330 
and things like that I'm not sure if
anybody<00:01:59.750> actually<00:02:00.140> reads<00:02:00.320> these<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:00.770> they're

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
anybody actually reads these but they're

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.730 
anybody actually reads these but they're
in<00:02:01.460> there<00:02:01.580> regardless<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:03.439> we<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.619> our

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
in there regardless and then we have our

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.580 
in there regardless and then we have our
micro<00:02:04.040> USB<00:02:04.400> cable<00:02:04.790> which<00:02:05.570> pairs<00:02:05.960> up<00:02:06.110> with<00:02:06.140> our

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
micro USB cable which pairs up with our

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.729 
micro USB cable which pairs up with our
the<00:02:07.189> power<00:02:07.369> brick<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.209> this<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.450> your<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.679> know

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
the power brick so this is your you know

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.320 
the power brick so this is your you know
your<00:02:09.950> charger<00:02:10.429> as<00:02:10.610> well<00:02:10.640> as<00:02:10.879> your<00:02:11.000> sync<00:02:11.209> cable

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
your charger as well as your sync cable

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.570 
your charger as well as your sync cable
so<00:02:11.659> not<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.080> older<00:02:13.040> devices<00:02:13.310> where<00:02:13.549> you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
so not like in older devices where you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.850 
so not like in older devices where you
just<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.939> the<00:02:14.230> straight<00:02:15.230> up<00:02:15.349> charger<00:02:15.709> this

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
just have the straight up charger this

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.290 
just have the straight up charger this
one

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
one

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.370 
one
so<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> separate<00:02:16.900> cable<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
so you have a separate cable on the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.750 
so you have a separate cable on the
power<00:02:17.590> block<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.100> can<00:02:18.280> use<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:18.700> a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
power block so you can use this for a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.890 
power block so you can use this for a
sync<00:02:18.970> cable<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.480> some<00:02:19.600> reason<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.840> don't

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
sync cable for some reason you don't

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.320 
sync cable for some reason you don't
have<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> microUSB<00:02:20.470> charger<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.130> ready<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
have a microUSB charger and ready and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.790 
have a microUSB charger and ready and
then<00:02:22.480> finally<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.960> bottom<00:02:23.170> there<00:02:23.350> pretty

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
then finally in the bottom there pretty

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.710 
then finally in the bottom there pretty
important<00:02:24.190> thing<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.610> battery<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.570> is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
important thing is the battery this is
