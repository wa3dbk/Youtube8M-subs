00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.480
 really serious changes 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.930
 evolution and after the third generation 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 occurred in 1996 completely 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.180
 the platform has changed and with it 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.290
 superpopular lancer model 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.630
 evolution 4 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.000
 the engine and gearbox were turned on 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.660
 180 degrees to lower the center 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 gravity 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.940
 as usual, two versions of rs and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 gsr 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 the frs version was released as racing 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 front differential car 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.850
 increased friction and rear 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.330
 friction type differential also in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.390
 the package included the seat jewel x and 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.640
 16-inch wheels on punching in fed 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100
 there were all the same Spartan conditions 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 of any additional options but 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 there were some additional 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 longitudinal beams for highway reinforcement 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.000
 also at mitsubishi lancer evolution 4p with 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.969
 was a lightweight body, and even as it may 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.789
 strangely refined glass new 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.069
 the generation has become slightly heavier than the particular 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.380
 evolution gsr due 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:26.969
 helping systems and to compensate 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.460
 this machines have become even more powerful both versions of m 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.479
 and shipped with a new double 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.429
 turbocharger increased 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.789
 maximum power compared to his 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.420
 3 to 280 horses and torque to 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.639
 350 2 was not meters for the first time 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 proposed a new system that 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:46.079
 drove rear wheel torque 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.560
 she made it possible to overcome 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.479
 turns even easier and faster 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.799
 delivered tonal vision like 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.729
 option gsr version from the result of 10,000 of it 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.470
 4 were rolled like hot cakes 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.390
 his 4 can be recognized by two major 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.240
 front fog lamps 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.729
 new tail lights become 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.470
 standard for evolution 6 which 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.470
 will be another symbol of the series 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.180
 A new class appears in rc in 1997 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.459
 mitsubishi to fit new 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.420
 class quickly oriented and 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.310
 whether Stalin made 4 of him and in January 98 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.629
 years the world appeared a new lancer 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.250
 evolution 5 much has been changed

 recaro 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.000
 body kit received and extended arches front 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.690
 and behind

 Brembo brakes were installed as well 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.980
 increased wheels 16 to 17 inches 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.040
 the engine has been boosted in several places 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.220
 chambers volume has been increased steel pistons 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.150
 easier and also changed the nozzles of 500 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.730
 tenths to 560 even the control unit 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.510
 the engine was replaced with a new one got so 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.620
 called flash memory moreover 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.319
 turbocharger again upgraded 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.690
 torque increased to 373 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.450
 newton meters and power though 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.120
 officially remained the same 280 horsepower 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.510
 however, many claimed that his 5 goes 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.150
 faster 4 with new aggressive rear 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.370

 looked like a powerful street fighter 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.430
 the car was initially only offered 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.160
 for the japan market but since interest in 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.200
 he was very, very started him 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.880
 sell in other countries including

 in england and in some states 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.209
 Europe 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.700
 mitsubishi lancer evolution 5 became 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.040
 a real legend, they bought it before 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.989
 actual receipt paying 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.319
 cost ahead fifth generation 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.680
 evolution was made until January 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.680
 99 years 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.550
 to replace evolution 5 in the ninety ninth 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.020
 year 6 came version of the lancer evo 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.610
 sixth generation change mitsubishi 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.340
 evolution touched mainly 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.200
 engine cooling and reliability for 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.060
 this goal has been set more 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.210
