00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
turnaround and we got Canberra down

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
we didn't play the way we wanted to and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.900 
we didn't play the way we wanted to and
like<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.710> said<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.040> gave<00:00:35.190> away<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.700> cheap

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
like I said we gave away some cheap

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
like I said we gave away some cheap
penalties<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> gave<00:00:37.500> away<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> fair<00:00:38.010> bit

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
penalties and and gave away a fair bit

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.280 
penalties and and gave away a fair bit
of<00:00:38.219> possession<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.690> can't<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.020> doing<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
of possession so we can't be doing that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.619 
of possession so we can't be doing that
heading<00:00:40.620> into<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> finals<00:00:43.879> yeah<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.059> does

heading into the finals yeah it does

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
heading into the finals yeah it does
we<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.829> wanted<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> win<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.460> game<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
we really wanted to win this game and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
we really wanted to win this game and
and<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.629> knew<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.930> had<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.050> short<00:00:49.440> turnaround

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and we knew we had a short turnaround

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.310 
and we knew we had a short turnaround
against<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.820> Canberra<00:00:51.690> side<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.110> there

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
against a Canberra side down there

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
against a Canberra side down there
they're<00:00:52.530> always<00:00:52.770> tough<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> play<00:00:53.670> against<00:00:53.940> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
they're always tough to play against so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.310 
they're always tough to play against so
it<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.300> important<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> two

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it was important that we got the two

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
it was important that we got the two
points<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.670> didn't<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.239> obviously

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
points which we didn't get and obviously

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.540 
points which we didn't get and obviously
like<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.170> said<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.770> pretty<00:00:58.920> disappointed

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.180 

I<00:01:26.420> used<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.230> love<00:01:27.350> touch<00:01:27.620> when<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:27.890> was<00:01:27.920> younger

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
I used to love touch when I was younger

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.480 
I used to love touch when I was younger
I<00:01:28.310> played<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.300> up<00:01:29.420> till<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.690> was<00:01:29.780> 18<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.430> want<00:01:31.430> a

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
I played it up till I was 18 and want a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.700 
I played it up till I was 18 and want a
junior<00:01:31.790> state<00:01:32.030> Cup<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.510> coma<00:01:33.320> stingrays

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
junior state Cup with the coma stingrays

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.370 
junior state Cup with the coma stingrays
so<00:01:33.980> that<00:01:34.880> all<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.270> coma<00:01:35.600> stingrays<00:01:35.960> out<00:01:36.170> there

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
so that all the coma stingrays out there

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.250 
so that all the coma stingrays out there
but<00:01:36.620> it's<00:01:37.460> good<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.760> see<00:01:37.940> touch<00:01:38.210> Elan<00:01:38.570> itself

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
but it's good to see touch Elan itself

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.890 
but it's good to see touch Elan itself
within<00:01:39.470> ROI<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.190> mean<00:01:40.370> this<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:40.910> great<00:01:41.600> players

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
within ROI I mean this and great players

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.200 
within ROI I mean this and great players
like<00:01:42.260> Benji<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:42.979> Sean<00:01:43.490> Johnson<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.120> have

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
like Benji and Sean Johnson that have

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.180 
like Benji and Sean Johnson that have
played<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> lot<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:44.750> touch<00:01:44.900> 40<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.350> hopefully

played a lot of touch 40 and hopefully

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.430 
played a lot of touch 40 and hopefully
in<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.340> future<00:01:46.400> we<00:01:46.850> could<00:01:46.970> see<00:01:47.210> young<00:01:48.140> kids

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
in the future we could see young kids

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.070 
in the future we could see young kids
make<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> transition<00:01:49.430> as<00:01:49.520> well<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.090> light<00:01:50.930> up

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
to love it during summer and now that

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.050 
to love it during summer and now that
it's<00:02:09.110> aligned<00:02:09.440> with<00:02:09.590> with<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.729> Rugby<00:02:11.030> League
