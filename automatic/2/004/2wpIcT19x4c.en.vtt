a Nintendo USA store and it does I don't

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.740 
a Nintendo USA store and it does I don't
know<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:27.000> sure<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.330> don't<00:01:27.420> sell

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750

okay so I think it's pretty hard to see
there's<00:01:35.970> no<00:01:36.119> real<00:01:36.479> way<00:01:36.750> too<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.590> this

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
there's no real way too good to do this

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.500 
there's no real way too good to do this
but

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510

button on the right right here these two
holes<00:03:55.950> are<00:03:56.220> hard<00:03:56.850> ones

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.020 

there<00:04:04.319> we<00:04:04.440> go

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
there we go

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
easier most let's go on a Time Attack so

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140 
easier most let's go on a Time Attack so
these<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.169> have<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.560> there's<00:04:26.460> only<00:04:26.520> ten

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
these you have to there's only ten

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.600 
these you have to there's only ten
levels<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.800> have<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:28.980> beat<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.190> within
