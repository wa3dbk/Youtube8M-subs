let's<00:00:53.380> start<00:00:53.560> from<00:00:53.740> I<00:00:53.950> use<00:00:54.520> this<00:00:54.730> just<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.710> idyll

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
let's start from I use this just a idyll

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.710 
let's start from I use this just a idyll
big<00:00:57.010> 2x1<00:00:57.520> made<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.060> block<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:59.050> it<00:00:59.290> it<00:00:59.740> is<00:00:59.950> the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
big 2x1 made a block of it it is the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.580 
big 2x1 made a block of it it is the
perfect<00:01:01.720> width<00:01:02.080> for<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.440> dsm-v<00:01:02.800> as<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.430> um

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
perfect width for the dsm-v as it is um

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.200 
perfect width for the dsm-v as it is um
was<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.619> three<00:01:06.100> centimeters<00:01:06.670> thick<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.909> it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
was a three centimeters thick thing it's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.529 
was a three centimeters thick thing it's
still<00:01:10.299> pretty<00:01:10.600> thick<00:01:11.909> nice<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.119> he<00:01:13.240> was<00:01:13.390> done

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
still pretty thick nice and he was done

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.239 
still pretty thick nice and he was done
that<00:01:13.689> three<00:01:13.990> centimeters<00:01:14.469> thick<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.009> just

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
that three centimeters thick and I just

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:20.039 
that three centimeters thick and I just
dug<00:01:15.700> into<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:15.999> as<00:01:16.749> you<00:01:16.899> can<00:01:17.020> see<00:01:17.200> now<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
dug into it as you can see now the

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.910 
dug into it as you can see now the
measurements<00:01:20.859> for<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.270> 24<00:01:22.270> piece<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.899> paper

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
measurements for the 24 piece of paper

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.370 
measurements for the 24 piece of paper
you're<00:01:24.310> gonna<00:01:24.429> want<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:25.109> turn<00:01:26.109> around

you're gonna want it to be turn around
you're<00:01:26.859> gonna<00:01:26.950> want<00:01:27.159> it<00:01:27.189> to<00:01:27.310> be<00:01:27.369> 42

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
you're gonna want it to be 42

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.359 
you're gonna want it to be 42
centimeters<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.719> no<00:01:29.679> hold<00:01:29.920> on<00:01:29.950> you're<00:01:30.249> gonna

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
centimeters and no hold on you're gonna

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.149 
centimeters and no hold on you're gonna
want<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.670> be<00:01:30.729> 45<00:01:31.240> or<00:01:31.659> be<00:01:31.840> 45<00:01:32.560> centimeters

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
want it to be 45 or be 45 centimeters

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.819 
want it to be 45 or be 45 centimeters
that's<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.549> length<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.969> the<00:01:34.179> SMG<00:01:34.829> excluding

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
that's the length of the SMG excluding

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.330 
that's the length of the SMG excluding
the<00:01:36.210> barrel<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.020> right<00:01:38.200> up<00:01:38.319> to<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.590> tip<00:01:39.219> of<00:01:39.249> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
the barrel so right up to the tip of the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.940 
the barrel so right up to the tip of the
gun<00:01:39.520> point<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:41.049> 45<00:01:41.380> centimeters<00:01:41.859> in<00:01:41.920> length

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
gun point so 45 centimeters in length

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.459 
gun point so 45 centimeters in length
now<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:42.819> could<00:01:43.389> do<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.630> on<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.899> three<00:01:44.229> if<00:01:44.350> you

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
now you could do that on a three if you

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.020 
now you could do that on a three if you
have<00:01:44.590> an<00:01:44.679> a3<00:01:44.979> printer<00:01:45.249> but<00:01:45.399> I've<00:01:45.609> made<00:01:45.880> it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
have an a3 printer but I've made it

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
have an a3 printer but I've made it
easier<00:01:46.329> by<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:50.700> getting<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.030> picture

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
easier by actually getting the picture

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.550 
easier by actually getting the picture
extending<00:01:54.159> it's<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.450> 45<00:01:55.450> centimeters<00:01:56.079> and<00:01:56.289> then

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
extending it's a 45 centimeters and then

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.370 
extending it's a 45 centimeters and then
putting<00:01:57.039> on<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.249> for<00:01:57.639> this<00:01:57.999> you<00:01:58.090> can<00:01:58.209> see<00:01:58.299> my<00:01:58.509> a4

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
putting on a for this you can see my a4

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.230 
putting on a for this you can see my a4
sheet<00:01:59.590> here<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.100> simply<00:02:00.639> I<00:02:00.700> print<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.179> off

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
sheet here and simply I print that off

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.340 
sheet here and simply I print that off
which<00:02:01.810> means<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.259> only<00:02:02.319> print<00:02:02.740> from<00:02:02.920> here

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
which means it only print from here

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.330 
which means it only print from here
downwards<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.409> once<00:02:05.560> I've<00:02:05.679> printed<00:02:05.859> it<00:02:06.039> off<00:02:06.130> I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
downwards and once I've printed it off I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.520 
downwards and once I've printed it off I
just<00:02:06.369> simply<00:02:06.909> hold<00:02:07.450> down<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.779> right<00:02:07.959> arrow

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
just simply hold down the right arrow

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.759 
just simply hold down the right arrow
and<00:02:09.750> I'll<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:10.959> give<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.439> move<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.590> across

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
and I'll just give it and move it across

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.640 
and I'll just give it and move it across
to<00:02:12.189> where<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.239> has<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.689> from<00:02:13.959> wherever<00:02:14.349> it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
to where it has to be from wherever it

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.370 
to where it has to be from wherever it
was<00:02:14.769> cut<00:02:14.980> off<00:02:15.010> floss<00:02:15.310> put<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:15.939> on<00:02:16.060> that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
was cut off floss put that on that

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.590 
was cut off floss put that on that
and<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:17.010> put<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.580> other<00:02:17.670> side<00:02:17.820> print

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
and then put it on the other side print

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.050 
and then put it on the other side print
that<00:02:18.720> off<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.410> only<00:02:19.530> left<00:02:19.950> with<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
that off and then you only left with the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.600 
that off and then you only left with the
end<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> barrel<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.440> 45<00:02:22.920> centimeters<00:02:23.430> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
end of the barrel so 45 centimeters it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.020 
end of the barrel so 45 centimeters it
takes<00:02:23.820> about<00:02:24.690> two<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.650> quarter<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.160> an<00:02:26.790> a4

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
takes about two and a quarter of an a4

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.770 
takes about two and a quarter of an a4
sheet<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.890> each<00:02:31.610> a4<00:02:32.610> sheet<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.000> 21

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
sheet because each a4 sheet is 21

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.880 
sheet because each a4 sheet is 21
centimeters<00:02:33.960> in<00:02:34.380> width<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.210> 21<00:02:36.210> 21<00:02:36.690> 42<00:02:37.290> plus<00:02:37.650> an

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
centimeters in width so 21 21 42 plus an

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.910 
centimeters in width so 21 21 42 plus an
extra<00:02:38.100> three<00:02:38.460> is<00:02:38.700> gonna<00:02:38.880> be<00:02:39.000> 45<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:40.350> yeah<00:02:40.590> two

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
extra three is gonna be 45 so yeah two

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.760 
extra three is gonna be 45 so yeah two
and<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> bit<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.690> a4<00:02:42.690> sheets<00:02:42.960> with<00:02:43.140> now<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
and a bit of a4 sheets with now the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.300 
and a bit of a4 sheets with now the
height<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.460> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.820> be<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:49.310> high

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
height of it is going to be it is high

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.210 
height of it is going to be it is high
it's<00:02:50.460> roughly<00:02:51.290> about<00:02:52.290> nineteen<00:02:52.800> seventies

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and then just build an extra stuff now

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.070 
and then just build an extra stuff now
the<00:03:45.090> barrel<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.570> use<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.050> is<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:47.600> not<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> toilet

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the barrel I use this is a not a toilet

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.770 
the barrel I use this is a not a toilet
roll<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.500> any<00:03:49.800> roll<00:03:50.040> from<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.780> paper

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
roll but any roll from like a paper

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.040 
roll but any roll from like a paper
towel<00:03:52.400> thing<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.360> was<00:03:54.540> originally<00:03:54.990> I

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
towel thing so that was originally I

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.970 
towel thing so that was originally I
think<00:03:55.670> what<00:03:56.670> could<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:56.910> been<00:03:57.980> thirty

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
think what could have been thirty

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.980 
think what could have been thirty
centimeters<00:03:59.459> long<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.820> cut<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.270> down<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.600> what

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
centimeters long I cut it down to what

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.830 
centimeters long I cut it down to what
it's<00:04:01.080> supposed<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.320> be<00:04:01.470> which<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.709> 23<00:04:02.840> so

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
it's supposed to be which is 23 so

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.810 
it's supposed to be which is 23 so
that's<00:04:03.990> 23<00:04:04.410> centimeters<00:04:04.980> long<00:04:05.160> which<00:04:05.610> is

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
that's 23 centimeters long which is

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.640 
that's 23 centimeters long which is
actually<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.180> very<00:04:06.420> good<00:04:06.720> size<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.290> put<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
actually a very good size to put on the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.980 
actually a very good size to put on the
end<00:04:07.770> so<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.940> 23<00:04:09.390> centimeter<00:04:09.810> roll

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
end so it's just a 23 centimeter roll

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.650 
end so it's just a 23 centimeter roll
and<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.260> just<00:04:10.440> put<00:04:10.620> a
