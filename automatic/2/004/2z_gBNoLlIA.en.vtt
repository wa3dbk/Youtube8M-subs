00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 Hello dear spectators, we are with the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.950
 electronics drums there is a new one 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.530
 model that dtx 522 k tells 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.990
 us what we for wedding rings have it 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.630
 called who we is great 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.720
 have a brand new module the dtx 502 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.390
 the re-design became the 500, so to speak 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 revised very great dynamics that must 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 Just look like a brand new one 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520
 Technique in it that you really can 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.700
 even play with it on the fingers 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 works well that many features that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.150
 Of course I can not do it all now 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 enumerate all the features but to 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.470
 example of sin are also in front 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 we have a lot of space here that you can do that 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.400
 even an acoustic set can screw 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 if you make something a hybrid 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.210
 like or want to get new tom pÃ¤tz man 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.220
 I think that's what they are here, too 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.800
 much softer than the old mopeds 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.300
 I can push him like that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 We can all go to the pools 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.210
 we can stop here as well 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.430
 continue to play muted we have three 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.990
 Zones now also very important for the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.780
 drummers because we can now have the cup 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.609
 play here with this bed completely 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.219
 great ebt order at every set we have 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.020
 The xp 80 comes with four tron sets as 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.649
 annoying with our proven silicone 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.350
 would have 13/3 sounds on the closer and 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.810
 new stable reck that's the first 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 to the 522 assurances to the module of course 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.409
 I could really be very long now 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.469
 would tell a lot of new sounds 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 have from the all series but also bfd 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.640
 Above all, we have the sound too 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.399
 whole dance and and dub sound and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.249
 Trance really really cool new 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.749
 drum sounds also exist in the rock section 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.640
 a lot of new things to discover 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.740
 Definitely more accurate 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 You should absolutely look at it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.859
 Try something I can say quickly 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.389
 we also have to have a little one 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.249
 You can save samples from one 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.859
 own sounds Rhine lahn and is new 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.119
 also that we have a usb in outer hands 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.369
 can do that directly with the computer 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.289
 connect and directly our tracks 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.420
 record or off 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.130
 Let's go on 1 because there 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.900
 is yes that dtx 532 k thereby 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.850
 is that different? 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.290
 at this set we have now 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.120
 a proper hype controller the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.220
 big hype machine with our big one 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.410
 proven controller and who just one 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.300
 So the right one would like to have the feeling 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.040
 on a real hyatt yes there next to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.160
 the big controller and we have it here 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.070
 The big crash still pots three zones 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.690
 But the big horse has gone 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.000
 otherwise basically the same 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.460
 improvements like the other on 122 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.920
 exactly here the new tom patz and 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.900
 the xp 80 and of course our module that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.620
 of course with all four drum kits that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.660
 same is 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.340
 you also wanted it here 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.390
 did you say more than that ? 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.520
 has a few others 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.330
 stories right yes in the two 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.850
 higher sets the 542 by 562 there we have 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.270
 completely silicone betz also on the toms 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.840
 you can see that here 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.640
 this set is a bit now 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.500
 Modified because you can do that too 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.450
 super complete yet with more space so 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.770
 You can expand it anytime you want 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.330
 would like to have a bigger child 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.190
 That's why we have one at the fair 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.750
 few examples built with it again 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.440
 see what you drumset from these to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.140
 can make 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.420
 you also play regularly on the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.420
 stood by before you personally as 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.910
 drummer favorite at a set now all 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.840
 games on stage have 542 came 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.420
 is absolutely great 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.100
 and that has a new strump kit that is called 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.420
 punk and that is absolutely the hammer so 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.310
 my favorite at and here I play 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.440
 almost every day I have to, of course 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.350
 our new app still show there is one 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.760
 new zombie tab and that is totally great 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.370
 you can download it for free 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.110
 and then you can with your fingers 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.060
 Brahms play if you want you can 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.790
 but also connect with his device 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.019
 with the 500 or the 400k or one 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.910
 Just go for a track 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.350
 play music and watch it play 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.239
 I must actually practice that is so 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.150
 a training app which is also a lot of fun 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.250
 makes and is free and great 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.200
 I can still be great 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 drums in any case I learn 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.070
 leave me alone you can too 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.540
 download 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.549
 I can do that very well 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.870
 that you have said it again now 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.340
 so again on the stage therefore many 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.140
 thanks for taking the course 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.140
 until the next shot
