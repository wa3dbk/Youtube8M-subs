so<00:02:09.920> they're<00:02:10.069> very<00:02:10.129> safe<00:02:10.640> during<00:02:10.939> a<00:02:11.090> lightning

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
so they're very safe during a lightning

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.630 
so they're very safe during a lightning
storm<00:02:11.420> which<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.900> kind<00:02:12.109> of<00:02:12.170> cool<00:02:12.409> the<00:02:12.980> timber

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
storm which is kind of cool the timber

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.170 
storm which is kind of cool the timber
frame<00:02:13.939> is<00:02:15.189> beautiful<00:02:16.189> it<00:02:16.400> gives<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.879> such

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
frame is beautiful it gives you such

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.509 
frame is beautiful it gives you such
architectural<00:02:17.959> freedom<00:02:18.439> because<00:02:19.129> you<00:02:19.310> can

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
architectural freedom because you can

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.539 
architectural freedom because you can
have<00:02:19.700> these<00:02:19.849> expanses<00:02:20.689> of<00:02:20.840> space<00:02:21.549> is

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
have these expanses of space is

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.569 
have these expanses of space is
cathedral<00:02:23.480> ceiling<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.469> house<00:02:24.829> has<00:02:25.219> a<00:02:25.250> lot<00:02:25.549> of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
cathedral ceiling the house has a lot of

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.750 
cathedral ceiling the house has a lot of
energy<00:02:25.849> efficient<00:02:26.689> aspects<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.579> my

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
energy efficient aspects to it one of my

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.149 
energy efficient aspects to it one of my
favorite<00:02:29.329> is<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.689> radiant<00:02:30.230> floors<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:31.010> all

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
favorite is the radiant floors it's all

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.550 
favorite is the radiant floors it's all
right<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.579> heat<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.540> energy<00:02:33.079> efficient

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
right in heat I have energy efficient

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.179 
right in heat I have energy efficient
lighting<00:02:33.920> there's<00:02:34.819> passive<00:02:35.629> solar<00:02:36.129> into<00:02:37.129> it

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
lighting there's passive solar into it

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.890 
lighting there's passive solar into it
which<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.549> very<00:02:37.790> important<00:02:38.359> part<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.750> this

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
which is a very important part of this

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.080 
which is a very important part of this

i've<00:02:46.549> incorporated<00:02:47.090> solar<00:02:47.870> tubes<00:02:48.260> rather

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
i've incorporated solar tubes rather

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.670 
i've incorporated solar tubes rather
than<00:02:49.480> which<00:02:50.480> are<00:02:50.629> much<00:02:50.750> more<00:02:51.049> energy

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
than which are much more energy

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.000 
than which are much more energy
efficient<00:02:52.159> than<00:02:53.049> skylights<00:02:54.049> in<00:02:54.379> the

terrordome section of the house and that
brings<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.389> natural<00:03:00.049> light<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.319> actually

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
brings in natural light and actually

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.369 
brings in natural light and actually
brings<00:03:01.129> in<00:03:01.540> moonlight<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.049> don't<00:03:03.319> even

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
brings in moonlight so you don't even

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.379 
brings in moonlight so you don't even
have<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.620> turn<00:03:03.829> lights<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.189> at<00:03:04.370> night<00:03:04.400> there's

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
have to turn lights on at night there's

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.809 
have to turn lights on at night there's
single<00:03:05.750> floor<00:03:06.169> living<00:03:06.500> for<00:03:07.219> ninety<00:03:07.700> percent
