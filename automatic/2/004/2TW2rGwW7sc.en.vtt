00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.940
 we even know about this hobby 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.940
 or maybe a bit away from the clothing Thomassen already a bit 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.580
 Longer until October, I'm one of Germany's most famous village club 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.599
 it all started 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.119
 It starts here I did a lot of sports I already have 20 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.070
 Handball played for years 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.560
 and sometime thus in the middle of 30 you are faced with the decision you make like this 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 the other older gentleman 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 and takes off the entire body before each game takes 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 Handfuls of painkillers and is best to inject a few syringes with it 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.450
 ever comes over the 60 minutes 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.660
 or will one have in the future been supplied Rademann family had said 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.920
 Kilian this body maybe you can use again but so 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.010
 from 70 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.400
 for which one foresees that we with it around 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.880
 and since the ruins have moved arm from Hamburg to Berlin and come since then 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.470
 now one of these runs knew what was needed 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.910
 Maximum penalties are for any ball player is run without a ball 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 Worst the penalties there are 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770
 have made footballers fines weekend as they do the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.180
 have strained what makes the coach on site in winter on 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.350
 continue on course 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 very important for handball players volleyball basketball players 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.470
 same 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 so far, it has been pure running for me so far 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.390
 senseless 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 a also a bit boring then one surely thinks on the way someday 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.690
 went back, for example, pro 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 you are not alone 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.220
 in Berlin you can tell the cat what time of day no matter what the defeat 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.240
 against donating to people around the area 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 Dober just knows Berlin never so important are runners 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.550
 or is this guy in his knight boots with plaid pants 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.980
 is that maybe now that can write his true percent or something 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.230
 everything is very, too 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.500
 this stylish and so surprising here and that started with the stories 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.080
 that I had thought 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.400
 the scene specialist literature 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.119
 you are not allowed to drink any more alcohol 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.590
 Soon she had to train a day 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.250
 User to release the children for adoption because of course Jen make 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 Training plan broken 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.530
 and so it went with the Polo effortlessly on Spiegel Online around 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 I thought maybe met a few people 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.049
 and that is when so many were 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.279
 shows that they have really good taste 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.079
 the ship has been doing for seven years that still makes a great deal 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.029
 fun 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.089
 and you do not believe how much 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.129
 really crazy in the clinch with this endurance sport on the go 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.539
 at the triathlon, for example, as twelve most beautiful experiences this year 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.469
 someone had really 300 euros in wind farms tightened time trial 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.609
 He invests all those with the long way back with this long tip 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.879
 but would not quite understand how that with him and took with him 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.809
 works and had the top still listed in front two roofers 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.060
 work the Zivis the special calls on 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.729
 interrupts view of things 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.869
 the thing a bit weird on the bike but we had a lot to 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:55.049
 laugh the year before as a million eyeglasses to fit a bike soared 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.559
 I also found it very funny when the sanis, I am close to the six-meter room brought advice 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:59.489
 become heir to the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.169
 Psyche van Gaal 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.379
 our that also means of course it's not just about sports it's all about 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.379
 a lot upstairs 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.219
 Moral how much great stuff I have look something great for people Schulig 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.340
 Harry copper and 12 in carbon cap I can afford 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.329
 Percent St 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.139
 it's like every club then 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.369
 also have a show of birthday everything 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:24.549
 Hoffmann of it then also can move elegantly that is not so always in the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.109
 center 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.669
 Thats fun 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.909
 Boxing very interesting what you have experienced this endurance sport 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.309
 then maybe come to times very special of the group of 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.759
 Endurance athletes who are particularly fond of Nordic Walkers on the lake like Constien 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.809
 to 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.809
 yes it is true the new Brucker can endurance sports 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.749
 the arbor promise to make working slim and beautiful 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.929
 really the reality diet which counteracts because 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:56.929
 I've never seen in slim beautiful that's always him 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.370
 So you can use a four-in-hand defense chain 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.699
 a and um 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.539
 that's the classic super had 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.289
 do as if 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:11.569
 the sporting goods industry a no no big great business yes you can 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.429
 People 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.679
 with the promise you do not have to be exhausting is just looking like this 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:21.039
 Miners go fearing expensive money flushes muffled the special track 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.729
 Sell ​​percent 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.860
 when you think okay Pauli Formula 1 has now also entered the Open this 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.069
 Cities are now yes 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.319
 elaborately constructed the suspension with Sebastian Vettel 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.389
 and the people called the wm-tour walking with the wooden stick 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.469
 Smoking GEA 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.419
 today 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.710
 you have to show to the outside that you moved to be totally professional 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 lead seven who became millionaire with it 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.849
 This good congratulations only pity that you have four million 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.800
 People with it locally 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.590
 Of course there is serious concern about children, the pieces I think are 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.629
 also longer 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.059
 and percent that is balance training or strength training in particular for 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.120
 Cross-country skiers stop in laborious 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.589
 There is no snow to offer at the business 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:09.469
 But what they do is trickle down, that's a preform 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.709
 from the pole vault to properly firm footprints and then right out 

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:15.889
 the upper body out of office from it 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.870
 this does not want to be done this way »said Feldner 300 meters 2 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.580
 because it is really pure 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.529
 what we are stepping on is like him 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.460
 So the banal version of the controversial goal is just beating 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.620
 open in a sitting posture 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.490
 700 meters at the tree parking lot and then but first is therefore the choirs 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.550
 Rhine-waal this year so exhausting 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.749
 and that is different than what they are from Scandinavia 9 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.679
 Courses advertised but of course every Boca has the chance someday 

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:44.210
 to try yes 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.620
 that's the strength way dear Jesus Luz 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.350
 Mu I can walk I can be steep for me 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.409
 the without aids 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.440
 traditional is yes but it is so when you grow old so mobile Tigers 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.609
 are as I can then when many other people need it too 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.650
 Winning coaches are still constantly at the same rate 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.220
 up to 900 meters will probably move in again but always again 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.580
 burns meters 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.020
 and these people are allowed to become 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.999
 How fast you can move forward 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.500
 without dying 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.690
 and I think it's a great experience just for self-awareness 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.740
 I wish you this again in the morning always through the forest failed 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.510
 but you cant entertain that well anymore and i still go 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.430
 The delivery vehicles from the kangaroo words eat there when running 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.900
 Of course not the traffic vaccine Gartner 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.189
 yes I think that's a very good inference said Walter 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:37.680
 thanks the interview 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.600
 Drums and torches
