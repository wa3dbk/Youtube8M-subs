00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
fast I think you can build confidence

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.989 
fast I think you can build confidence
momentum<00:02:23.269> by<00:02:23.569> doing<00:02:23.989> well<00:02:24.139> in<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.379> cup<00:02:24.590> I

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:24.999 
momentum by doing well in the cup I

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.149 
momentum by doing well in the cup I
think<00:02:25.999> the<00:02:26.090> lads<00:02:26.269> it's<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> first<00:02:27.439> season<00:02:27.799> for

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
think the lads it's the first season for

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.559 
think the lads it's the first season for
many<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.579> Premier<00:02:28.879> League<00:02:28.909> anyway<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:29.420> I

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
many in the Premier League anyway so I

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.660 
many in the Premier League anyway so I
think<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.870> energy<00:02:30.200> levels<00:02:30.530> will<00:02:30.709> be<00:02:30.739> top<00:02:31.400> top

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
think the energy levels will be top top

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.170 
think the energy levels will be top top
and<00:02:32.239> really<00:02:32.870> high<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.379> I'm<00:02:34.040> not<00:02:34.250> afraid<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.549> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
and really high so I'm not afraid of the

championship<00:03:04.489> for<00:03:05.239> four<00:03:05.659> years<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.169> we're

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:06.949 
championship for four years so we're

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:12.309 
championship for four years so we're
here<00:03:07.069> by<00:03:07.930> performances<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.769> now<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:12.139> way<00:03:12.290> I

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
here by performances but now the way I

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.740 
here by performances but now the way I
look<00:03:12.650> at<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.519> move<00:03:13.669> the<00:03:13.849> team<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.389> little<00:03:14.629> bit

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
look at it to move the team a little bit

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.009 
look at it to move the team a little bit
forward<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.500> next<00:03:15.739> step<00:03:15.919> I<00:03:16.069> think<00:03:16.780> I've<00:03:17.780> got<00:03:17.989> a

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
forward the next step I think I've got a

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.679 
forward the next step I think I've got a
couple<00:03:18.199> of<00:03:18.319> ideas<00:03:18.439> how<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.799> do<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.430> think<00:03:20.359> a

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
couple of ideas how to do that I think a

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.409 
couple of ideas how to do that I think a
club<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.250> size<00:03:22.310> when<00:03:22.819> you<00:03:22.909> go<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> cup

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
club of this size when you go to cup

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.890 
club of this size when you go to cup
