people ask me about my hand technique
from<00:00:26.369> my<00:00:26.460> friends<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.859> without

from my friends but without

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
from my friends but without
understanding<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:29.609> blasting<00:00:30.119> technique<00:00:30.539> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
understanding my blasting technique you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
understanding my blasting technique you
won't<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.560> able<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.949> understand<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.700> feelings

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
won't be able to understand the feelings

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.470 
won't be able to understand the feelings
so<00:00:33.600> my<00:00:33.960> first<00:00:34.230> tutorial<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.700> last

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so my first tutorial will be about last

00:00:36.480 --> 00:01:05.560 
so my first tutorial will be about last
beats

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.749 

basically<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.320> techniques<00:01:07.759> for

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
basically I use two techniques for

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.180 
basically I use two techniques for
slower<00:01:09.000> stuff<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.600> use<00:01:10.200> basically<00:01:10.710> wrist

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
slower stuff I use basically wrist

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.550 
slower stuff I use basically wrist
movement<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.869> finger

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
movement and a little bit of finger

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:32.779 
movement and a little bit of finger
movement<00:01:14.009> just<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:30.800> this<00:01:31.800> is<00:01:32.369> nothing

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
movement just like this this is nothing

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.840 
movement just like this this is nothing
special<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.990> special<00:01:34.110> path<00:01:34.560> begins<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.729> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
special the special path begins when it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.740 
special the special path begins when it
gets<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.570> faster

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.050 

before<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.780> talk<00:01:45.050> about<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.590> technique<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.220> want

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
before I talk about the technique I want

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.210 
before I talk about the technique I want
to<00:01:47.150> talk<00:01:47.360> about<00:01:47.510> how<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.200> hold<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.740> stick

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
to talk about how to hold the stick

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.560 
to talk about how to hold the stick
I<00:01:49.390> hope<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.570> mistake<00:01:51.380> basically<00:01:51.860> just

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
I hope this mistake basically just

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.390 
I hope this mistake basically just
between<00:01:53.570> my<00:01:54.020> thumb<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.470> my<00:01:54.530> index<00:01:54.740> finger

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
between my thumb and my index finger

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.320 
between my thumb and my index finger
like<00:01:55.760> this<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.979> other<00:01:58.159> fingers<00:01:58.550> just<00:01:58.970> close

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
like this the other fingers just close

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.740 
like this the other fingers just close
around<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.810> stick<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.910> very<00:02:01.910> important<00:02:02.479> is

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
around the stick a very important is

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.940 
around the stick a very important is
that<00:02:03.460> my<00:02:04.460> arm<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.600> stick<00:02:05.869> are<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.860> a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
that my arm and the stick are in a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.400 
that my arm and the stick are in a
straight<00:02:07.280> line<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.909> don't<00:02:08.690> hold<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> stick

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
straight line I don't hold the stick

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.120 
straight line I don't hold the stick
like<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.830> or<00:02:10.239> however<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.100> very

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
like this or however it is just a very

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.130 
like this or however it is just a very
straight<00:02:13.880> line<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:14.989> very<00:02:15.230> important

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
straight line this is very important

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.510 
straight line this is very important
first<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.260> all<00:02:18.470> when<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.950> hold<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.310> stick

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
first of all when you hold the stick

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.960 
first of all when you hold the stick
like<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:20.020> turn<00:02:21.020> your<00:02:21.260> hand<00:02:21.500> by<00:02:21.890> around<00:02:22.250> 45

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
like this turn your hand by around 45

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.330 
like this turn your hand by around 45
degrees<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:28.720> now<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.800> thumb<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
degrees like this now the thumb and the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.880 
degrees like this now the thumb and the
index<00:02:32.030> finger<00:02:32.420> play<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.170> most<00:02:33.320> important

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
index finger play the most important

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.120 
index finger play the most important
role<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.370> executing<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.120> technique<00:02:36.130> first

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
role in executing this technique first

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.390 
role in executing this technique first
of<00:02:37.310> all<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.150> very<00:02:38.180> strange<00:02:38.780> feeling<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
of all it's a very strange feeling to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.490 
of all it's a very strange feeling to
open<00:02:40.850> up<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.239> hand<00:02:41.450> when<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.989> do<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.290> first

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
open up the hand when you do the first

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.690 
open up the hand when you do the first
stroke<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:45.010> normally<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.489> hand

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
stroke like this normally the hand

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.729 
stroke like this normally the hand
always<00:02:46.970> closes<00:02:47.690> when<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.019> do<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> hit<00:02:48.410> like

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
always closes when you do a hit like

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.420 
always closes when you do a hit like
this<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:50.390> now<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.079> hand<00:02:51.320> has<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.829> open<00:02:52.190> up<00:02:54.430> so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
this but now the hand has to open up so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.410 
this but now the hand has to open up so
the<00:02:55.700> thump<00:02:55.940> pushes<00:02:56.480> down<00:02:56.660> on<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> stick

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
the thump pushes down on the stick

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.819 
the thump pushes down on the stick
basically<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.690> could<00:02:59.989> do<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.260> technique<00:03:00.590> only

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
basically I could do this technique only

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.280 
basically I could do this technique only
with<00:03:01.100> index<00:03:01.519> finger<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.970> thumb<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.540> this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.319 

the<00:03:06.290> other<00:03:06.470> fingers<00:03:06.829> just<00:03:07.100> add<00:03:07.370> stability<00:03:08.120> and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
the other fingers just add stability and

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.310 
the other fingers just add stability and
power<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.670> push<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.720> stick<00:03:11.930> down<00:03:12.049> like

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
power so you push the stick down like

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.000 
power so you push the stick down like
this<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.890> open<00:03:13.310> up<00:03:13.430> your<00:03:13.670> fingers<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.650> second

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
this and open up your fingers the second

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.670 
this and open up your fingers the second
stroke<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.549> very<00:03:16.820> easy<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.989> just<00:03:18.019> close<00:03:18.470> your

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
stroke is very easy you just close your

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.039 
stroke is very easy you just close your
hand<00:03:18.890> like<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.360> could<00:03:26.600> do<00:03:26.810> this

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
hand like this now you could do this

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.440 
hand like this now you could do this
motion<00:03:27.320> only<00:03:27.650> with<00:03:28.130> with<00:03:28.579> your<00:03:28.760> fingers<00:03:29.120> like

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
motion only with with your fingers like

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.690 
motion only with with your fingers like
this<00:03:31.360> but<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.380> add<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> little<00:03:34.070> bit<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.280> wrist

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
this but but I add a little bit of wrist

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:42.120 
this but but I add a little bit of wrist
movement<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:36.019> add<00:03:36.200> more<00:03:36.440> power<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:37.130> this

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.490 

see<00:03:43.130> how<00:03:43.310> my<00:03:43.489> wrist<00:03:43.910> movement<00:03:44.390> supports<00:03:45.140> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
see how my wrist movement supports the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.030 
see how my wrist movement supports the
movement<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.130> fingers<00:03:50.739> when<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:51.769> grab

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
movement of the fingers when you grab

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
as possible try something like this

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.050 
as possible try something like this
start<00:04:06.230> very<00:04:06.439> slowly<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.220> gradually<00:04:07.549> get

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
start very slowly and gradually get

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.979 
start very slowly and gradually get
faster<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.810> try<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.829> adjust<00:04:10.569> hold<00:04:11.569> your<00:04:11.810> hand

as<00:04:12.140> loose<00:04:12.379> as<00:04:12.650> possible<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:26.030> see<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.449> hope<00:04:26.720> my

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
as loose as possible you see I hope my

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.439 
as loose as possible you see I hope my
hand<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:27.410> loose<00:04:27.680> have<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.280> stick<00:04:28.520> gradually

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
hand so loose have to stick gradually

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:42.010 
hand so loose have to stick gradually
turns<00:04:30.139> in<00:04:30.440> my<00:04:30.650> fingers<00:04:31.070> like<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:40.900> when<00:04:41.900> you

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
turns in my fingers like this when you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.500 
turns in my fingers like this when you
got<00:04:42.139> all<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.620> with<00:04:42.979> one<00:04:43.250> hand<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:44.240> want<00:04:44.449> to

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
got all this with one hand you want to

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.420 
got all this with one hand you want to
try<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.810> with<00:04:44.870> both<00:04:45.229> both<00:04:45.710> ends<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:46.220> the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
try it with both both ends because the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.719 
try it with both both ends because the
blast<00:04:46.789> speed<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.660> basically<00:04:48.729> alternating

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
blast speed is basically alternating

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.300 
blast speed is basically alternating
right<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.240> left<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.490> works<00:04:52.930> first

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
right and left and so it works first

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.240 
right and left and so it works first
open<00:04:55.310> up<00:04:55.460> your<00:04:55.669> right<00:04:56.000> hand<00:04:56.860> now<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.919> left

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
open up your right hand now the left

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.930 
open up your right hand now the left
hand<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:59.030> now<00:04:59.900> close<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.470> right<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.160> then

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
hand and now close the right and then

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:10.439 
hand and now close the right and then
close<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.479> left<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.620> have<00:05:03.889> this<00:05:04.099> pattern

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.000 

you<00:05:11.449> have<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.690> practice<00:05:12.110> this<00:05:12.320> over<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.860> over

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
you have to practice this over and over

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.939 
you have to practice this over and over
again<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.729> get<00:05:13.880> it<00:05:14.030> straight<00:05:14.360> but<00:05:15.320> when<00:05:15.830> it

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
again to get it straight but when it

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:23.860 
again to get it straight but when it
works<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.610> works<00:05:16.760> very<00:05:17.120> great<00:05:22.449> now<00:05:23.449> let's<00:05:23.690> see

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
works it works very great now let's see

00:05:23.870 --> 00:07:04.939 
works it works very great now let's see
how<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.229> looks<00:05:24.440> on<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.650> drunk<00:05:24.949> it

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.230 

okay<00:07:05.949> that's<00:07:06.310> it<00:07:06.460> for<00:07:06.490> today

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
okay that's it for today

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.659 
okay that's it for today
next<00:07:07.960> time<00:07:08.139> I'll<00:07:08.380> really<00:07:08.740> focus<00:07:09.130> on<00:07:09.460> the

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
next time I'll really focus on the

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:20.530 
next time I'll really focus on the
friends<00:07:11.160> see<00:07:12.160> you<00:07:12.190> then

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.600
