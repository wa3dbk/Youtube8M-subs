00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960 
music and they play the music and it's
wonderful<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> guess<00:02:44.069> I've<00:02:44.310> got<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.670> start

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
wonderful so I guess I've got to start

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.810 
wonderful so I guess I've got to start
going<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.360> bed<00:02:45.690> at<00:02:46.050> 3am<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.070> getting<00:02:47.640> up

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
going to bed at 3am and getting up

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.500 
going to bed at 3am and getting up
sometime<00:02:48.570> after<00:02:49.080> nine<00:02:49.260> thirty<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:50.100> this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
sometime after nine thirty when this

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.840 
sometime after nine thirty when this
when<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.750> bloke<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:52.680> or<00:02:52.950> otherwise<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
when this bloke is there or otherwise I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.330 
when this bloke is there or otherwise I
will<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.360> be<00:02:54.630> shouting<00:02:55.320> at<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> radio<00:02:56.010> all

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
will just be shouting at the radio all

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.330 
will just be shouting at the radio all
the<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.739> guess<00:02:58.739> that's<00:02:58.950> just<00:02:59.040> my

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the time so I guess that's just my

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.670 
the time so I guess that's just my
little<00:03:00.110> grumble<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:03.680> certainly

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
little grumble if you like but certainly

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.020 
little grumble if you like but certainly
ruined<00:03:05.640> my<00:03:06.150> listening<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.670> possibly<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:09.000> of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
ruined my listening and possibly that of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.440 
ruined my listening and possibly that of
many<00:03:09.420> others<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.230> think<00:03:10.890> maybe<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.580> BBC<00:03:12.269> is

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
many others I do think maybe the BBC is

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.030 
many others I do think maybe the BBC is
dumbing<00:03:12.900> down<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:15.080> maybe<00:03:16.080> everything<00:03:16.860> is

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
dumbing down and maybe everything is

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.060 
dumbing down and maybe everything is
aimed<00:03:17.340> at<00:03:17.610> youth<00:03:17.880> now<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:19.110> don't<00:03:19.470> really<00:03:19.739> know

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
aimed at youth now I I don't really know

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.830 
aimed at youth now I I don't really know
about<00:03:20.280> them<00:03:20.850> anyway<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:24.500> that's<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.840> i'll

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
about them anyway so that's it and i'll

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.069 
about them anyway so that's it and i'll
try<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.709> be<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.250> brighter<00:03:29.519> mood<00:03:29.910> next<00:03:30.870> time

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
try to be in a brighter mood next time

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.970 
try to be in a brighter mood next time
but<00:03:31.440> until<00:03:32.160> then<00:03:32.430> as<00:03:32.760> always<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.450> course

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
but until then as always of course

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.980
