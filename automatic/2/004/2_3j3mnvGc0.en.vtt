00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.400

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.790
 to live with a man what's that 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.770

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.540
 I think it's great, no, but I really 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.070
 I think it's great 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.340
 to live with a man is better than 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.809
 dog anyway but if a dog is 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.100
 damn binding every night and 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.269
 ask to go out they get drunk this 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.350
 what are you with her when 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.660
 but who goes out every night does not miss 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.129

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.170
 1 it's true I'm still 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.839
 first to defend you who recently 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.070
 I read in a survey that 80% of 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.149
 husbands fool their wife 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.890
 it's disgusting no and ben no 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.670
 wait for me I say that polls 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.140
 it's bullshit 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.490
 there is the public to raise their hands 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.799
 husbands who deceive their wives 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.090
 dirty hands naulleau did not see it well 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.040
 Polls are bullshit 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.540
 kids traveling all the time and me 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.520
 and me and I who have lived fifteen years 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.110
 only I think it's great to have a 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.310
 man at home but frankly I 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.750
 find it's not complicated to live 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.070
 in harmony with his darling 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.350

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.360

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.439

 you who take the prunes if you go 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.299
 to pass that on the account of the 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.549
 gallantry so hold on speaking of 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.899
 gallantry why in a couple when 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.490
 the man and the woman by working the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.049

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.329
 rotten what is this rule that makes 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.119
 part of the Ten Commandments 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.640

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.150
 make you feel guilty about girls 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.380

 marriage point it's me who has it 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.670

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.810
 clear it's simple for example offense of 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.150
 leaking in front of the dishes to make two 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.750

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.959
 minus there is km his hands-free kit 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:12.220
 overly prolonged use of 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.200
 toilet 6 points in me huh but I 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.269
 do not understand that you spend so much 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.709
 of time in the toilets the guys no 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.690
 but seriously at home the toilet 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.360
 it's a blue zone I installed the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.479
 disk system with entrance hours 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.710
 and hours of outing we bend spoil war on 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.360
 is there so much 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.740
 interesting in geese earth guys 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.060
 me at first I thought they had 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.310
 dug a tunnel that goes directly to 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.260
 local bistro 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.450
 so that's six points less then 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.440
 it's severe but be careful he can 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.000
 collect points 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.919
 by following awareness courses 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.650
 to the female 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:48.100
 of course these are paid internships that 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.430
