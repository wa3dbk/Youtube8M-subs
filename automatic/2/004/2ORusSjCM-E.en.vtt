example our combines reading out at 12%
but<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.009> take<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> back<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.729> moisture

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
but we take it back to our moisture

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
but we take it back to our moisture
meter<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> elevator<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.830> tell<00:01:20.040> us

it's<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.460> 13%<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> adjust<00:01:23.520> our

it's at 13% so we need to adjust our

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's at 13% so we need to adjust our

but<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.780> example<00:01:40.290> let's<00:01:41.100> say<00:01:41.369> our<00:01:41.930> combine<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
but for example let's say our combine is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.149 
but for example let's say our combine is
reading<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.680> 16%<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> oh<00:01:45.750> man

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
reading out at 16% we take it oh man

fire moisture meters only reading out of
15<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.890> need<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.190> back<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.550> off<00:01:50.610> 1%<00:01:51.800> we<00:01:52.800> can

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
15 so we need to back that off 1% we can

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.590 
15 so we need to back that off 1% we can
go<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.369> calibration<00:01:53.759> number<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.360> here

go to this calibration number right here

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
go to this calibration number right here
touch<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.170> changes<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> negative<00:01:57.000> 1<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.890> R
