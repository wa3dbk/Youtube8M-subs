big<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.360> unfortunately<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
big for that unfortunately because I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.930 
big for that unfortunately because I
think<00:01:40.260> it'd<00:01:40.410> be<00:01:40.440> cool<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.710> you'd<00:01:40.980> get<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.340> figure

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
think it'd be cool if you'd get a figure

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.490 
think it'd be cool if you'd get a figure
on<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.480> a<00:01:42.510> 5<00:01:42.690> millimeter<00:01:42.870> pegs<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.350> hang

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
on here with a 5 millimeter pegs to hang

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190 
on here with a 5 millimeter pegs to hang
on<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.060> some<00:01:45.480> humanoid<00:01:45.870> figures

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
on there might be some humanoid figures

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.290 
on there might be some humanoid figures
about<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.500> size<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.890> might<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.490> hands<00:01:48.120> I

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
about the size that might have hands I

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.360 
about the size that might have hands I
could<00:01:48.450> hold<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.620> he<00:01:50.070> doesn't

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
could hold this but he doesn't

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.370 
could hold this but he doesn't
unfortunately<00:01:51.240> work<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.600> any<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:52.290> the

unfortunately work with any of the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
unfortunately work with any of the
current<00:01:52.650> transformers<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.400> think<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.940> said

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.810 
these handle they are they are handles
you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.620> see<00:01:55.800> their<00:01:55.920> handles<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.580> foot

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you can see their handles and foot

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.230 
you can see their handles and foot
plates<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:58.520> they<00:01:59.520> don't<00:01:59.700> fit<00:01:59.940> in<00:02:00.120> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
plates here but they don't fit in the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.640 
plates here but they don't fit in the
fists<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.630> any<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.960> color<00:02:01.140> figures<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.620> I

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
fists of any of the color figures that I

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.020 
fists of any of the color figures that I
found<00:02:03.650> so<00:02:04.650> yeah<00:02:04.770> he<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> one-step<00:02:05.790> which

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
found so yeah he is a one-step which

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.610 
found so yeah he is a one-step which
means<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.420> very<00:02:06.480> easy<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.930> transform<00:02:07.470> him

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
means it's very easy to transform him

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.979 
means it's very easy to transform him
and<00:02:07.800> all<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.119> push<00:02:09.629> down<00:02:09.660> on

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and all you have to do is push down on

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.420 
and all you have to do is push down on
these<00:02:10.080> handles<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.160> there's<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> little

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
these handles you see there's a little

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.729 
these handles you see there's a little
clip<00:02:11.730> back<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.569> great<00:02:13.379> piece<00:02:13.560> just

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
clip back here on this great piece just

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.089 
clip back here on this great piece just
gonna<00:02:13.950> basically<00:02:14.340> push<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.640> handle<00:02:14.940> down<00:02:16.099> and

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
gonna basically push the handle down and

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.479 
gonna basically push the handle down and
fix<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.760> pops<00:02:17.940> up<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.590> there<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.370> there's

fix-it
his<00:02:21.750> only<00:02:22.019> real<00:02:22.349> articulation<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.430> his

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
his only real articulation is that his

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.160 
his only real articulation is that his
arms<00:02:23.760> move<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.150> down<00:02:24.269> they<00:02:24.840> could<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.050> do

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
arms move up and down they could they do

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.850 
arms move up and down they could they do
move<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.349> little<00:02:25.440> bit<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
move a little bit there on the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.580 
move a little bit there on the
transformation<00:02:26.400> hinge<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:26.730> there's<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
transformation hinge but there's a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.460 
transformation hinge but there's a
did<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.220> joint<00:02:29.430> right<00:02:29.580> there<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:31.290> his

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
did it joint right there that's his

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
did it joint right there that's his
articulation<00:02:31.740> I'm<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.910> kinda<00:02:33.270> he<00:02:33.360> can

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
articulation I'm you can kinda he can

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
articulation I'm you can kinda he can
roll<00:02:33.690> around<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:34.110> his<00:02:34.230> wheels<00:02:34.410> he<00:02:34.980> has<00:02:35.070> some

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
roll around on his wheels he has some

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460 
roll around on his wheels he has some
little<00:02:35.430> feet<00:02:35.640> up<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.240> steady<00:02:36.960> him<00:02:37.170> when

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
little feet up here to steady him when

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.470 
little feet up here to steady him when
he's<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.770> rolling<00:02:37.950> around<00:02:38.220> oh<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.330> just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
he's not rolling around oh it's just

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.660 
he's not rolling around oh it's just
having<00:02:39.600> leaned<00:02:39.840> forward<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.320> bit<00:02:40.670> he's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
having leaned forward a little bit he's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.480 
having leaned forward a little bit he's
a<00:02:41.700> little<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.120> too<00:02:42.300> front-heavy<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:44.130> sit<00:02:44.340> back

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
a little bit too front-heavy to sit back

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.120 
a little bit too front-heavy to sit back
like<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.820> maybe<00:02:45.060> pull<00:02:45.360> his<00:02:45.450> arms<00:02:45.660> down<00:02:46.130> to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
like this maybe pull his arms down to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.470 
like this maybe pull his arms down to
his<00:02:47.250> side's<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.730> guess<00:02:47.910> that's<00:02:48.060> about<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.330> far

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
his side's I guess that's about as far

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360 
his side's I guess that's about as far
down<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:48.990> go<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.830> he's<00:02:49.950> still<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
down as I can go and he's still just a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.130 
down as I can go and he's still just a
little<00:02:50.400> too<00:02:50.640> front-heavy<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.810> he<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:51.990> roll

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
little too front-heavy but he can roll

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.300 
little too front-heavy but he can roll
around<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.470> his<00:02:52.590> wheels<00:02:52.830> like<00:02:52.920> he<00:02:53.010> does<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
around on his wheels like he does on the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.840 
around on his wheels like he does on the
show<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.530> still<00:02:55.530> stand<00:02:55.770> up<00:02:55.950> okay<00:02:56.070> when<00:02:56.730> he's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
show and still stand up okay when he's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.000 
show and still stand up okay when he's
not<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.660> again<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.500> there's<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.800> clip

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
not and again that there's that clip

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.530

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
transform yet on the show unless it's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.220 
transform yet on the show unless it's
been<00:03:32.070> for<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> real<00:03:32.459> quick<00:03:32.730> scene<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.049> can

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
been for a real quick scene that I can

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.789 
been for a real quick scene that I can
recall<00:03:34.580> but<00:03:35.580> yeah<00:03:36.480> for<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.959> he's<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
recall but yeah for the for the he's the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.080 
recall but yeah for the for the he's the
right<00:03:37.920> size<00:03:38.100> class<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:38.580> making<00:03:38.850> him<00:03:39.060> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
right size class I think making him a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.060 
right size class I think making him a
one-step<00:03:39.480> changer<00:03:39.959> kind<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.560> works<00:03:40.709> for<00:03:40.920> him

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
one-step changer kind of works for him

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.520 
one-step changer kind of works for him
he's<00:03:41.549> got<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.730> very<00:03:41.910> unique<00:03:42.299> shape<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.290> dig

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
he's got a very unique shape and I dig

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.979 
he's got a very unique shape and I dig
it

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
it

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.539 
it
yeah<00:03:45.989> just<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.290> little<00:03:46.410> basic<00:03:46.680> one-step<00:03:47.220> figure

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
yeah just a little basic one-step figure

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.370 
yeah just a little basic one-step figure
I<00:03:50.269> figure<00:03:51.269> they<00:03:51.390> gave<00:03:51.570> your<00:03:51.750> family<00:03:52.049> character

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
I figure they gave your family character

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.640 
I figure they gave your family character
it's<00:03:52.500> worth<00:03:52.620> picking<00:03:52.799> up<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.630> very<00:03:55.500> basic

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
it's worth picking up it is very basic

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.850 
it's worth picking up it is very basic
but<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.459> fix<00:03:56.700> it
