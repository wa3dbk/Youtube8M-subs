 neighbors in neighborhoods and we are brothers 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.900

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.460
 we have 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.590

 say Oscar Rodríguez but well when 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.780
 He said we are brothers he said it in 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.860
 a figurative sense or they are genetically 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.880
 not figurative brothers do not have the same 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.650
 father the same mind 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.250
 and how they met 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.250
 in a party 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.299
 the common 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.900
 half wolf of the flames 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.900
 and you have an appointment 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.090
 not only instrumental 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.350
 at 8 in the morning you two were 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.350
 awake making music 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 damaged while the world is partying 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.070
 let's write without candle light 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.070
 did not say 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.780
 but then who started rapping me 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780
 First 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.439
 I just write 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.470
 songs that I write since I have 12 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.470
 years 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.210
 that is, you wrote before, but you 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.600
 you had a mastery of the color scenario 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.700
 of graduation denial 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.980
 and this Saturday at nine o'clock at night 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.170
 they are going to give a concert here in Miami 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.670
 dade county auditorium indicated 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.140
 cordially to the public that the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.200
 accompany that they are two musicians 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.930
 supremely talented thank you very much 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.760
 that are going to that a lot of music are going to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.860
 put on stage boys 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.840
 we do hip hop rap 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.470
 that is what we do is not a new 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 music properly as is why or 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.460
 either of the topics we talked about are not 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
 issues that I eat that are marketed and 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.970
 much less in the country where we come from 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.480
 we talk about social issues 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.810
 about political issues rather thanks to 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.810
 our work 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.959
 but when neurons dance what 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.959
 Delight is not better 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.709
 neurons 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:28.220
 millions of neurons millions of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.080
 neurons and the songs of the villagers 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.990
 they also have a political edge 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.180
 not only do we come from a country where everyone 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.310
 political slogans political children 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.930
 sports the best with politics 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.660
 also art mixes it with 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.570
 politics all the best with politics and 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.060
 then in a country like that we 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.410
 go ahead and denounce things is very 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.470
 difficult and at least not roses politics 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.870
 but that is a risk 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.890
 you in the songs are pronounced 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.950
 politically more or less that is if I 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.250
 I ask you sympathize with the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.210
 current government of Cuba 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.210
 or unsympathetic 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.689
 because because we think that 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.609
 that actually the freedom that is said 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:22.889
 that was achieved in Cuba as Mom said 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.169
 mature on January 1 , 50 and 99 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.169
 real because there is no freedom to 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.639
 expression now after 54 years that 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.740
 Cubans have the freedom to travel 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.139
 to the freedom to sell buy house 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.240
 but there is no freedom of expression and everything 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.069
 it is a falsehood that is all those changes 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.620
 that there have been if two or 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.960
 three things but for nothing then it has 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.219
 needed which probably because 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.979
 we were not alive yet 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.960
 batista so he was a dictator if he 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.949
 had completed the year 50 was a 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.389
 dictator but those who took it 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.250
 they were rowers their own that the 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.720
 disease has not left the dictator in 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.550
 dictator has passed 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.660
 we do not only know people for example 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.950
 of mobility with the boys who 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.920
 they were prey to listen to the music 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.830
 we 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.680
 that's how it has been and they are prisoners now 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.740
 they left and they gave him freedom because 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.010
 I was beating you balance by 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.930
 make this music the art 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.080
 in general it would have to always have a 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.510
 component of rebellion and criticism 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.580
 to the power that you in those are great 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.200
 artists but they have not gotten 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.440
 you the political commissioners them 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.670
 They have never been direct with us or 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.520
 when they say they can not sing 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.980
 they send here that you can not tell who 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.580
 have to see the load aaron of 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.530
 above 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.420
 that's a classic phrase called from 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.130
 up they called led up and 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.930
 the problem the problem is in that 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.820
 when we started like no 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.400
 as I see they did not take us very seriously 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740
 then when they wanted to put a 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.750
 strong pressure to shut up was already 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.090
 too late because it was cardio because 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.500
 the people were with you from whole water 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.120
 he knew us they knew us in 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.120
 Latin America Wholesaler of discs 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.180
 what yes
