we're going to go over some of the finer

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.250 
we're going to go over some of the finer
details<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.639> perfecting<00:00:09.630> your<00:00:09.750> running<00:00:10.110> form

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
details of perfecting your running form

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.190 
details of perfecting your running form
and<00:00:10.800> basically<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:12.240> Newton<00:00:12.599> running<00:00:12.929> form

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and basically with Newton running form

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.770 
and basically with Newton running form
we're<00:00:13.410> talking<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.980> LAN<00:00:14.190> lever<00:00:14.519> lift

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
we're talking about the LAN lever lift

simultaneously<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.090> use<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.539> toes<00:00:48.870> like

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
simultaneously if you use all toes like

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
a sprinter you're all propulsive and no
cushion<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.100> you're<00:00:56.219> walking<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.969> very

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
cushion so if you're walking it's very

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.479 
cushion so if you're walking it's very
natural<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.780> strike<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> roll<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:59.070> you're

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
natural to strike and roll if you're

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
natural to strike and roll if you're
sprinting<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.840> natural<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.469> very

you<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.650> leverage<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.400> simply<00:01:14.850> lift<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you get leverage and then simply lift in

you get leverage and then simply lift in
the<00:01:16.140> walking<00:01:16.650> gait<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.430> strike<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> heel<00:01:18.150> roll

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the walking gait we strike the heel roll

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.510 
the walking gait we strike the heel roll
through<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.290> toe<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
through to the toe and we can do this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
through to the toe and we can do this
pretty<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.180> day<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> walk<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.350> day

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
pretty much all day you can walk all day

moment ago you have rotational forces

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.199 
moment ago you have rotational forces
and<00:02:40.739> now<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.130> have<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.459> push<00:02:41.730> through<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
and now you have to push through and

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.990 
and now you have to push through and
push<00:02:42.420> off<00:02:42.630> hard<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.350> which<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.100> overusing

right<00:03:05.400> where<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> actuator<00:03:06.030> lugs<00:03:06.330> are<00:03:06.540> you'll

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
right where the actuator lugs are you'll

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.410 
right where the actuator lugs are you'll
then<00:03:07.350> feel<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.709> levering<00:03:08.310> action<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.940> then

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
then feel the levering action and then

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.380 
then feel the levering action and then
you<00:03:09.510> simply<00:03:09.780> lift<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.620> land<00:03:11.100> lever<00:03:11.430> lift<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
you simply lift so land lever lift so

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.570 
you simply lift so land lever lift so
it's<00:03:12.540> athletic<00:03:13.080> position<00:03:13.260> find<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> sweet

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
it's athletic position find the sweet

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.490 
it's athletic position find the sweet

land lever lift by sensing the ground

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.630 
land lever lift by sensing the ground
quicker<00:03:25.200> you'll<00:03:25.680> be<00:03:25.829> able<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.160> feel<00:03:26.459> the
