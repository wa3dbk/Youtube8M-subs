00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.880 
don't know if this piss be there I found
a<00:03:01.269> block<00:03:03.510> there's<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.690> book<00:03:07.170> warps<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.470> warp<00:03:08.709> in

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
a block there's a book warps and warp in

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.090 
a block there's a book warps and warp in
chant<00:03:09.220> which<00:03:09.640> probably<00:03:10.380> warps<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:11.500> over<00:03:11.800> here

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
chant which probably warps you over here

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.680 
chant which probably warps you over here
because<00:03:14.340> there's<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.519> lot<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.760> books<00:03:16.060> here<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.630> I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
because there's a lot of books here so I

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.199 
because there's a lot of books here so I
assume<00:03:17.170> yeah<00:03:17.709> this<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.820> war<00:03:19.000> pinch

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
assume yeah this is the war pinch

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.780 
assume yeah this is the war pinch
antwerp<00:03:19.870> hobo<00:03:20.410> was<00:03:20.709> probably<00:03:21.160> like<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.610> hobo

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
chest in pvp it's probably the front

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.330 
chest in pvp it's probably the front
because<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.989> see<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> lot<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.590> people<00:03:26.950> going<00:03:27.070> over

out<00:04:16.209> I've<00:04:16.540> no<00:04:16.930> idea<00:04:17.049> but<00:04:17.799> I'll<00:04:18.280> figure<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.730> out

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
out I've no idea but I'll figure it out

but<00:04:19.840> as<00:04:20.260> I'm<00:04:20.500> saying<00:04:20.769> they<00:04:20.889> should<00:04:21.070> make<00:04:21.220> a

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
but as I'm saying they should make a

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.590 
but as I'm saying they should make a
plug-in<00:04:22.380> where<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.460> like<00:04:25.330> we're<00:04:25.570> a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
plug-in where you can like we're a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.260 
plug-in where you can like we're a
dinner<00:04:25.960> like<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.650> donator<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.460> toggle<00:04:27.790> on<00:04:28.180> and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
dinner like a donator can toggle on and

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.010 
dinner like a donator can toggle on and
off<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.530> see<00:04:29.830> if<00:04:30.100> peoples<00:04:30.910> being<00:04:31.479> killed<00:04:31.780> or

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.510 
off to see if peoples being killed or
not<00:04:32.169> like<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:32.860> would<00:04:32.950> be<00:04:32.979> pretty<00:04:33.190> cool<00:04:33.310> if

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
not like that would be pretty cool if

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.400
