00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.720
 I greet you in the next lesson knit 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.029
 knitting needles 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.830
 Today I'll show you how to tally here 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.830
 such a small background pattern 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.059
 this mating is used when knitting 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.670
 sweater semi vera can also be her 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:38.329
 combine with other patterns knits 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 it is very simple and in order to 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.489
 tie we need to dial 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.789
 number of loops which is divided by 2 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.949
 plus 2 edge so I typed 20 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.920
 loops and proceed to knitting knitting 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.800
 used used purl 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.329
 side because the drawing is just 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.979
 it turns out on the wrong side 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.239
 the front side looks like this so we 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.909
 scored in the number of loops needed and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.340
 knit first row 1 edge loop 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.960
 removed further fit the face 1 and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.400
 nakid and the next loop are done 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.870
 removed this way further again 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.800
 1 front nakid and the loop is not removed 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:37.450
 and so on until the end of the row 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.450
 the loop is removed knit to the end of the row 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 so front nakid and last loop 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:15.670
 and the last loop is removed from us 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 goes purl so we turn the product 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.709
