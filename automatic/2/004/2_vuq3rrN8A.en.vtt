00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that out and kind of compare them

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
that out and kind of compare them
together<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:24.689> two<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.230> very<00:00:25.619> very

town<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:46.379> pointed<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> price<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.550> both<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
town I pointed out the price on both of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
town I pointed out the price on both of
these<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> also<00:00:48.719> wanted<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> include<00:00:49.680> how

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
these so I also wanted to include how

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040 
these so I also wanted to include how
much<00:00:50.129> product<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.910> comes<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
much product actually comes with it the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
much product actually comes with it the
NYC<00:00:52.410> liquid<00:00:52.920> liner<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.370> point<00:00:53.730> 17<00:00:54.239> ounces<00:00:54.660> in

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
NYC liquid liner has point 17 ounces in

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
NYC liquid liner has point 17 ounces in
the<00:00:55.050> L'Oreal<00:00:55.410> telescopic<00:00:55.559> has<00:00:56.160> point<00:00:56.399> 23

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the L'Oreal telescopic has point 23

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.939 
the L'Oreal telescopic has point 23
ounces<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> L'Oreal<00:00:58.140> telescopic<00:00:58.289> comes

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
ounces so the L'Oreal telescopic comes

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
ounces so the L'Oreal telescopic comes
with<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.340> bit<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.789> eyeliner<00:01:00.239> but

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
with a little bit more eyeliner but

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.500 
with a little bit more eyeliner but
almost<00:01:01.020> triple<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.440> price<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.550> NYC<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
almost triple the price as the NYC so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.170 
almost triple the price as the NYC so
this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> NYC<00:01:04.769> liner<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> mine<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> kind

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
this is the NYC liner and mine is kind

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.570 
this is the NYC liner and mine is kind
of<00:01:06.299> old<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> has<00:01:07.229> bared<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> brunt<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of old so it has bared the brunt of a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
of old so it has bared the brunt of a
lot<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> I'm<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
lot of use and I'm just going to put a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.390 
lot of use and I'm just going to put a
little<00:01:11.610> line<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.840> hand<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.100> thing

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
little line on my hand and this thing

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.090 
little line on my hand and this thing
has<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> very<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.509> long<00:01:15.900> wand<00:01:16.290> both<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.950> these

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
has a very very long wand both of these

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
has a very very long wand both of these
two<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.820> these<00:01:18.060> aren't<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> type<00:01:18.659> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
two so these aren't the type of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
two so these aren't the type of
eyeliners<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.439> would<00:01:19.590> recommend<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.130> you're

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
eyeliners I would recommend if you're

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
eyeliners I would recommend if you're
just<00:01:20.490> beginning<00:01:20.700> personally<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.810> like

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
just beginning personally I really like

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.630 
just beginning personally I really like
them<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.380> I've<00:01:22.650> been<00:01:22.920> applying<00:01:23.189> liquid

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
them because I've been applying liquid

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
them because I've been applying liquid
liner<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> longest<00:01:24.509> time<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
liner for the longest time and I have a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
liner for the longest time and I have a
very<00:01:25.979> steady<00:01:26.280> hand<00:01:26.369> applying<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.900> these

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
very steady hand applying it with these

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
very steady hand applying it with these
long<00:01:28.500> ones<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.430> close<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.909> grip

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
long ones you don't get as close of grip

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.390 
long ones you don't get as close of grip
but<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> could<00:01:30.810> control<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> line<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.220> lot

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
but you could control the line a lot

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.859 
but you could control the line a lot
better<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.970> these<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.390> could<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.659> some

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
better so these you could get some

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
better so these you could get some
really<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.470> nice<00:01:34.710> fine<00:01:35.100> lines<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> I

just going to let them both dry for a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
just going to let them both dry for a
few<00:01:55.680> minutes<00:01:56.219> okay<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.090> both

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
few minutes okay so they are both

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
few minutes okay so they are both
completely<00:01:58.020> dried<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> L'Oreal

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
completely dried and the L'Oreal

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
completely dried and the L'Oreal
telescopic<00:01:59.610> is<00:02:00.299> slightly<00:02:00.869> darker<00:02:01.290> than<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
telescopic is slightly darker than the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.249 
telescopic is slightly darker than the
NYC<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.119> enough<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> make<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> humongous

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
NYC but not enough to make a humongous

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.800 
NYC but not enough to make a humongous
difference<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> am<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.719> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
difference and now I am just going to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.839 
difference and now I am just going to
rub<00:02:07.110> them<00:02:07.320> niether<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.979> waterproof<00:02:08.459> so

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
rub them niether these are waterproof so

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.339 
rub them niether these are waterproof so
they<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.239> completely<00:02:09.599> come<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.140> water

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
they will completely come off in water

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.559 
they will completely come off in water
if<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.679> rub<00:02:10.890> them<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.730> am<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> run<00:02:12.420> them

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
if I rub them but I am going to run them

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.839

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
so you could see which one kind of lasts

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.180 
so you could see which one kind of lasts
