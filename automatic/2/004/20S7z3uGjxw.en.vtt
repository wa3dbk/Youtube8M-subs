00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
too many entries and the first thing we

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.550 
too many entries and the first thing we
liked<00:00:17.850> because<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.570> hybrid<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
liked because it's a hybrid is that it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349 
liked because it's a hybrid is that it
gets<00:00:19.740> 40<00:00:20.039> miles<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.400> gallon

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
gets 40 miles a gallon

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
gets 40 miles a gallon
the<00:00:21.660> EPA<00:00:21.960> ratings<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.710> different

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the EPA ratings are a little different

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.859 
the EPA ratings are a little different
but<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.340> tested<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.850> car<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.359> weekend<00:00:24.720> over

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
but we tested this car this weekend over

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.500 
but we tested this car this weekend over
about<00:00:25.109> 600<00:00:25.650> miles<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.550> consistently<00:00:27.150> got

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
about 600 miles and we consistently got

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810 
about 600 miles and we consistently got
right<00:00:27.810> around<00:00:28.050> 40<00:00:28.349> miles<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.769> gallon<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
right around 40 miles a gallon that's a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420 
right around 40 miles a gallon that's a
mix<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.240> freeway<00:00:30.750> use<00:00:31.080> puddling<00:00:31.859> around<00:00:32.160> town

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
mix of freeway use puddling around town

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
mix of freeway use puddling around town
and<00:00:32.669> there's<00:00:32.820> quite<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> lot<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> rural<00:00:33.570> Hill

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
and there's quite a lot of rural Hill

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
and there's quite a lot of rural Hill
driving<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.680> where<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.790> course<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.180> hybrid<00:00:36.510> can

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
driving to where of course a hybrid can

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
driving to where of course a hybrid can
recapture<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> energy<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> spent

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
recapture some of the energy you spent

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
recapture some of the energy you spent
getting<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> hill<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> comes<00:00:39.480> down

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
getting up the hill when it comes down

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
getting up the hill when it comes down
so<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.649> thing<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> this

so the first thing we like is that this

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.900 
so the first thing we like is that this
is<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> compact<00:00:42.739> hatchback<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.980> luxury<00:00:44.399> compact

hatchback for that fairly nice car that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
hatchback for that fairly nice car that
gets<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> 40<00:00:47.910> miles<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.239> gallon<00:00:48.649> second<00:00:49.649> thing

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
gets you 40 miles a gallon second thing

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.889 
gets you 40 miles a gallon second thing
we<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> has<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.629> more

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we like is that it has a more

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
we like is that it has a more
conventional<00:00:52.289> interior<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> console

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
conventional interior in the console

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
conventional interior in the console
than<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.469> Toyota<00:00:55.800> Prius<00:00:56.100> which<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
than the Toyota Prius which is kind of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
than the Toyota Prius which is kind of
the<00:00:57.030> definitive<00:00:57.329> hybrid<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.649> doesn't<00:00:59.160> have

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the definitive hybrid this doesn't have

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.639 
the definitive hybrid this doesn't have
what<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> call<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> flying<00:01:00.420> buttress<00:01:01.079> console

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
what we call the flying buttress console

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.310 
what we call the flying buttress console
that<00:01:01.829> comes<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> top<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> dashboard

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
that comes from the top of the dashboard

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.609 
that comes from the top of the dashboard
straight<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.680> between<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.150> seats<00:01:06.619> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
straight down between the two seats you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
straight down between the two seats you
can<00:01:07.799> actually<00:01:08.130> put<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.700> arm<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> armrest

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
can actually put your arm on the armrest

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.990 
can actually put your arm on the armrest
there<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> use<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
there and use what we think of as the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
there and use what we think of as the
mouse<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.659> pointer<00:01:12.990> control<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
mouse the pointer control for the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
mouse the pointer control for the
navigation<00:01:14.130> screen<00:01:14.430> very<00:01:15.270> comfortably<00:01:15.720> from

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
navigation screen very comfortably from

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
navigation screen very comfortably from
the<00:01:16.110> driver's<00:01:16.500> seat<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> third<00:01:18.330> thing<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the driver's seat the third thing that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
the driver's seat the third thing that
we<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> car<00:01:19.770> has<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> sport<00:01:20.520> mode

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we like that the car has a sport mode

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.660 
we like that the car has a sport mode
and<00:01:21.350> frankly<00:01:22.350> sport<00:01:22.770> mode<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> fun<00:01:23.640> part

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and frankly sport mode is the fun part

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.390 
and frankly sport mode is the fun part
of<00:01:24.180> driving<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.840> CT<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.189> modes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
of driving the CT it has three modes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
of driving the CT it has three modes
actually<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.240> normal<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.259> when

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
actually it's got normal which is when

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually it's got normal which is when
you<00:01:28.560> drive<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.040> most<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> time<00:01:29.729> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you drive it in most of the time it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
you drive it in most of the time it's
got<00:01:30.479> eco<00:01:30.869> mode<00:01:31.110> when<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
got eco mode when you really want to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.109 
got eco mode when you really want to
wring<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.119> last<00:01:33.509> mileage<00:01:34.759> frankly<00:01:35.759> eco

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
wring out that last mileage frankly eco

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.870 
wring out that last mileage frankly eco
mode<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.900> much<00:01:37.079> fun<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:38.070> sport<00:01:38.670> mode

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
mode is not that much fun but sport mode

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.789 
mode is not that much fun but sport mode
is<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> whole<00:01:39.360> lot<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.659> fun<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.350> does<00:01:40.560> is

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
is a whole lot of fun what it does is

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.730 
is a whole lot of fun what it does is
remaps<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.729> acceleration<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.439> way<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
remaps the acceleration and the way the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.980 
remaps the acceleration and the way the
transmission<00:01:44.369> shifts<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.149> more

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
transmission shifts to give you more

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.010 
transmission shifts to give you more
engine<00:01:46.619> torque<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.549> give<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.689> easily

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
engine torque to give it more easily

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.240 
engine torque to give it more easily
when<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.560> accelerate<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.540> essentially<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
when you accelerate and essentially it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.889 
when you accelerate and essentially it
makes<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:54.149> bit<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> hot<00:01:54.600> hatch

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
makes this a little bit of a hot hatch

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.780 
makes this a little bit of a hot hatch
it'll<00:01:55.470> never<00:01:55.649> compete<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.219> Volkswagen

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it'll never compete with a Volkswagen

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.480 
it'll never compete with a Volkswagen
GTI<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.540> frankly<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.280> fun<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
GTI but frankly it's way more fun to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
GTI but frankly it's way more fun to
drive<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.909> sport<00:02:00.210> mode<00:02:00.270> than<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.899> either<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
drive in sport mode than in either of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.980 
drive in sport mode than in either of
the<00:02:01.290> other<00:02:01.409> two<00:02:01.500> modes<00:02:01.920> plus<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.240> energy

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the other two modes plus the energy

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
the other two modes plus the energy
gauge<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.860> dash<00:02:05.100> turns<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
gauge on the dash turns into a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.910 
gauge on the dash turns into a
tachometer<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.869> cool<00:02:07.140> you'll<00:02:07.740> really

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
tachometer which is cool you'll really

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.359 
tachometer which is cool you'll really
need<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> Commodore

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
need it to Commodore

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.770 
need it to Commodore
the<00:02:09.789> engine<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.179> still<00:02:10.300> going<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.509> do<00:02:10.630> what

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
the engine is still going to do what

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.000 
the engine is still going to do what
it's<00:02:10.899> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.110> do<00:02:11.260> when<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> do

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
it's going to do when it's going to do

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's going to do when it's going to do
it<00:02:12.160> that's<00:02:12.400> how<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.580> hybrid<00:02:12.940> system<00:02:13.090> works

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
it that's how the hybrid system works

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.300 
it that's how the hybrid system works
but<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.380> at<00:02:14.500> least<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> feeling<00:02:15.250> of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
but you at least get the feeling of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.849 
but you at least get the feeling of
sport<00:02:15.670> mode
