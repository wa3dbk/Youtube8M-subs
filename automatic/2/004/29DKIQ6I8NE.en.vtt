 I am tea tasters I am going to you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.410
 propose today how to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 prepare iced tea there are two 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.590
 ways to prepare iced tea I 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.720
 would almost say the bad is the good 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.640
 I'll go quickly on the bad 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.199
 is to prepare the tea very 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.920
 classic with hot water and has 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.080
 hit the tea this method is very 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 average as far as cloudy tea 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.019
 very quickly and an aspect that he is 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.850
 not very favorable 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 there is a second method a lot 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 more interesting which consists of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 to prepare the cold tea we take tea 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 in bulk who can be know as well 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.989
 heard and we put twice as many 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.739
 quantity of tea only for a prepared tea 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.739

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 Some tea 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.110
 and we will infuse a minimum of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.420
 four or five hours but for example 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.000
 prepare the cold tea at night for the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.310
 next morning is ideal you need to know 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.250
 that the tpr is not cold-prepared 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.990
 develops no bitterness 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.880

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.560
