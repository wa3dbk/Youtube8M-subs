good we got some great stuff to talk
about<00:01:29.610> today<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.840> let's<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.170> into<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.939> an

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
about today so let's get into it an

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.980 
about today so let's get into it an
american<00:01:33.450> named<00:01:33.630> Abraham<00:01:34.259> Maslow<00:01:35.869> came<00:01:36.869> up

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
american named Abraham Maslow came up

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.109 
american named Abraham Maslow came up
with<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> theory<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.860> he<00:01:38.220> called<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.490> human

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
with a theory that he called the human

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.300 
with a theory that he called the human
hierarchy<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> needs<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.429> this<00:01:41.429> theory<00:01:41.819> was

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
hierarchy of needs and this theory was

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
hierarchy of needs and this theory was
simple<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.429> in<00:01:44.549> concept<00:01:45.060> somewhat<00:01:45.899> profound

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
simple one in concept somewhat profound

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.219 
simple one in concept somewhat profound
and<00:01:46.470> its<00:01:46.560> implications<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.539> humans<00:01:48.539> have

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and its implications that humans have

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.940 
and its implications that humans have
needs<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.920> must<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.340> met<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:51.590> these<00:01:52.590> needs

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
needs that must be met and these needs

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889 
needs that must be met and these needs
can<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.280> stratified<00:01:53.880> into<00:01:54.270> certain<00:01:54.539> levels

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
can be stratified into certain levels

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.809 
can be stratified into certain levels
and<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.470> need<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> bottom<00:01:56.159> needs<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.640> met

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
and they need the bottom needs to be met

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.279 
and they need the bottom needs to be met
first<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.539> progress<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> next

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
first and then they progress to the next

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.630 
first and then they progress to the next
level<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.890> when<00:01:59.039> those<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.220> met<00:01:59.490> they

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
level and when those are met they

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.070 
level and when those are met they
progress<00:01:59.849> to<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.149> next<00:02:00.240> level<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> start

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
progress to the next level so you start

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.449 
progress to the next level so you start
off<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.319> physiological<00:02:02.069> needs<00:02:02.220> food

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
off with the physiological needs food

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.699 
off with the physiological needs food
clothing<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.909> shelter<00:02:03.000> let's<00:02:03.509> say<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.049> those

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
clothing and shelter let's say if those

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.350 
clothing and shelter let's say if those
are<00:02:04.890> met<00:02:05.069> or<00:02:05.099> once<00:02:05.429> those<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.640> met<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.179> then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
are met or once those are met you then

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
are met or once those are met you then
be<00:02:06.599> cut<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.200> concerned<00:02:07.500> more<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.679> the

actualization I know if this is true or

actualization I know if this is true or
not<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.430> what<00:02:14.549> abraham<00:02:14.880> believed<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.349> i

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
thought this was a good model so i

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.660 
thought this was a good model so i

i<00:02:56.040> used<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.670> was<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.850> bad<00:02:57.150> thing<00:02:57.540> i

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
i used to think this was a bad thing i

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.910 
i used to think this was a bad thing i
know<00:02:57.780> jesus<00:02:58.049> when<00:02:58.290> are<00:02:58.380> they<00:02:58.440> ever<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.829> to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
know jesus when are they ever going to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.650 
know jesus when are they ever going to
believe<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.370> we're<00:02:59.489> gonna<00:02:59.579> going<00:03:00.389> to<00:03:00.480> be

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
believe that we're gonna going to be

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.300 
believe that we're gonna going to be
able<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.230> turn<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.470> thing<00:03:01.530> around<00:03:01.709> but

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
able to turn this thing around but

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.059 
able to turn this thing around but
actually<00:03:02.790> now<00:03:03.000> i<00:03:03.030> think<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:03.480> great<00:03:04.069> because

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
actually now i think it's great because

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.920 
actually now i think it's great because
what<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.549> means<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:06.030> they<00:03:06.299> we've<00:03:06.720> now

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
what it means is they we've now

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.699 
what it means is they we've now
convinced<00:03:07.769> them<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.220> we've<00:03:09.060> taken<00:03:09.090> care<00:03:09.420> of

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
convinced them that we've taken care of

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.099 
convinced them that we've taken care of
last<00:03:10.709> month's<00:03:11.069> question<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.900> they're<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:13.019> to

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
last month's question and they're on to

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.629 
last month's question and they're on to
the<00:03:13.200> next<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.040> i<00:03:14.069> thought<00:03:14.280> well<00:03:14.400> let's<00:03:14.459> get

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
the next one so i thought well let's get

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.190 
the next one so i thought well let's get
ahead<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> game<00:03:15.269> let's<00:03:15.599> try<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> figure

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
ahead of the game let's try to figure

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.020 
ahead of the game let's try to figure
out<00:03:16.349> what<00:03:16.680> all<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.340> questions<00:03:17.760> are<00:03:17.880> going<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
out what all the questions are going to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.949 
out what all the questions are going to
be<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.590> map<00:03:19.590> out<00:03:19.799> where<00:03:20.069> we<00:03:20.250> are<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.569> that's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
be and map out where we are so that's

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.870 
be and map out where we are so that's
what<00:03:22.260> that's<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.980> Apple<00:03:23.340> hierarchy<00:03:23.849> of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
what that's what the Apple hierarchy of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.749 
what that's what the Apple hierarchy of
skepticism<00:03:24.509> is<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.870> borrows<00:03:25.380> from<00:03:25.759> from

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:26.759 
skepticism is and it borrows from from

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:27.660 
skepticism is and it borrows from from
dr.<00:03:27.060> master

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
dr. master

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.930 
dr. master
so<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.870> first<00:03:29.170> level<00:03:29.440> what<00:03:30.310> we<00:03:30.430> encountered<00:03:30.880> a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
so the first level what we encountered a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.360 
so the first level what we encountered a
year<00:03:31.150> ago<00:03:31.560> was<00:03:32.560> survival<00:03:33.420> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.399 

a<00:03:37.459> lot<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.180> people<00:03:38.420> thought<00:03:38.750> apple<00:03:39.019> was<00:03:39.290> in

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
a lot of people thought apple was in

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.930 
a lot of people thought apple was in
this<00:03:39.560> some<00:03:39.830> sort<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.099> death<00:03:40.340> spiral<00:03:40.610> which<00:03:40.819> I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
this some sort of death spiral which I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.600 
this some sort of death spiral which I
think<00:03:41.120> there<00:03:41.209> was<00:03:41.330> some<00:03:41.450> truth<00:03:41.629> to<00:03:41.890> what<00:03:42.890> did

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
think there was some truth to what did

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.210 
think there was some truth to what did
we<00:03:43.790> do<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.450> did<00:03:44.720> many<00:03:45.290> many<00:03:45.560> things<00:03:45.890> but<00:03:46.099> the

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
we do we did many many things but the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.559 
we do we did many many things but the
three<00:03:46.459> things<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.849> stood<00:03:47.030> out<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.209> people's

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
three things that stood out in people's

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.180 
three things that stood out in people's
minds<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:48.019> brought<00:03:48.379> in<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.560> new<00:03:48.590> management

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
minds we brought in a new management

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.910 
minds we brought in a new management
team<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.640> run<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.879> company<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.500> new<00:03:51.500> board<00:03:51.799> of

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
team to run the company a new board of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.680 
team to run the company a new board of
directors<00:03:52.340> it's<00:03:52.549> got<00:03:52.700> some<00:03:52.940> phenomenally

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
directors it's got some phenomenally

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.460 
directors it's got some phenomenally
experienced<00:03:54.590> people<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:57.260> did<00:03:57.440> a

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
experienced people on it and we did a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.710 
experienced people on it and we did a
deal<00:03:57.739> with<00:03:57.769> Microsoft<00:03:58.549> but<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.180> largest

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
deal with Microsoft but the largest

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.600 
deal with Microsoft but the largest
software<00:04:00.019> company<00:04:00.230> in<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> world<00:04:00.680> wanted<00:04:01.579> to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
software company in the world wanted to

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.240 
software company in the world wanted to
help<00:04:01.940> Apple<00:04:02.390> was<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.599> fact<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.260> didn't<00:04:03.620> didn't

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
help Apple was a fact that didn't didn't

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.430 
help Apple was a fact that didn't didn't
escape<00:04:04.400> very<00:04:04.760> many<00:04:04.909> people<00:04:05.269> and<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:06.110> added<00:04:06.290> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
escape very many people and it added a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.229 
escape very many people and it added a
lot<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.620> credibility<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.489> what<00:04:07.640> we<00:04:07.790> were<00:04:07.909> doing

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
lot of credibility to what we were doing

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.509 
lot of credibility to what we were doing
and<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:09.379> combination<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.280> these<00:04:10.459> three

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
and the combination of these three

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.819 
and the combination of these three
things<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.239> lot<00:04:11.269> of<00:04:11.450> other<00:04:11.690> medium<00:04:12.560> sized

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
things and a lot of other medium sized

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.970 
things and a lot of other medium sized
things<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.609> think<00:04:14.200> convinced<00:04:15.200> people<00:04:15.500> fairly

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
things I think convinced people fairly

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.939 
things I think convinced people fairly
rapidly<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:17.180> survival<00:04:18.139> at<00:04:18.410> least<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.859> the

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
rapidly that survival at least in the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.180 
rapidly that survival at least in the
short<00:04:19.280> term<00:04:19.549> was<00:04:20.120> not<00:04:20.359> an<00:04:20.570> issue<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.979> gave

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
short term was not an issue and it gave

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.580 
short term was not an issue and it gave
us<00:04:22.340> some<00:04:22.550> time<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.850> demonstrate<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:24.410> we

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
us some time to demonstrate that we

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.810 
us some time to demonstrate that we
could<00:04:24.770> accomplish<00:04:25.039> some<00:04:25.340> other<00:04:25.460> things<00:04:25.669> so

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
could accomplish some other things so

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.719 
could accomplish some other things so
immediately<00:04:26.660> once<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:28.070> did<00:04:28.250> these<00:04:28.430> things

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
immediately once we did these things

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.140 
immediately once we did these things
then<00:04:28.940> everybody<00:04:29.330> moved<00:04:29.570> up<00:04:29.570> a<00:04:29.840> level<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:31.150> you

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
then everybody moved up a level and you

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.790 
then everybody moved up a level and you
know<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.990> can't<00:04:33.740> see<00:04:34.010> when<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.310> do<00:04:34.460> that<00:04:35.800> so

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
know I I can't see when you do that so

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.740 
know I I can't see when you do that so
maybe<00:04:37.310> later<00:04:37.639> could<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.030> do<00:04:38.150> some<00:04:38.330> more<00:04:38.449> that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
maybe later could we do some more that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.190 
maybe later could we do some more that
really<00:04:39.020> helped<00:04:39.199> me<00:04:39.350> thinks<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.720> they<00:04:41.720> moved<00:04:41.960> up

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
really helped me thinks so they moved up

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.500 
really helped me thinks so they moved up
a<00:04:42.320> level<00:04:42.349> so<00:04:43.160> if<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.340> wasn't<00:04:43.669> about<00:04:43.729> survival

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
a level so if it wasn't about survival

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.150 
a level so if it wasn't about survival
it<00:04:44.599> was<00:04:44.720> well<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.440> there's<00:04:45.620> no<00:04:45.800> stable

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
it was well but there's no stable

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.490 
it was well but there's no stable
