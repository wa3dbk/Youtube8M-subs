or<00:01:59.700> not<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.869> Zambia<00:02:01.350> San

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560

hi<00:02:02.180> unfortunately<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.240> don't<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.540> it's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
hi unfortunately I don't think it's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
hi unfortunately I don't think it's
going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> happen<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.850> never

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
going to happen but you never

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.139 
going to happen but you never
now<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.429> never<00:02:08.429> knew<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:08.970> going

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
now because I never knew there was going

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.530 
now because I never knew there was going
to<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.269> spec<00:02:09.690> ops<00:02:09.899> again<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:11.269> those<00:02:12.269> really

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to be spec ops again but I those really

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.750 
to be spec ops again but I those really
matter<00:02:12.750> because<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:13.860> uh<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.730> might

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
matter because it was but uh there might

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.030 
matter because it was but uh there might
be<00:02:14.910> zombies<00:02:15.390> there's<00:02:15.599> I'll<00:02:16.440> say<00:02:16.739> there's<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
be zombies there's I'll say there's a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.440 
be zombies there's I'll say there's a
twenty-five<00:02:17.580> percent<00:02:17.760> chance<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.390> zombies

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
twenty-five percent chance of zombies

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
twenty-five percent chance of zombies
now<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.440> don't<00:02:19.620> know<00:02:19.739> there's<00:02:20.160> no<00:02:20.250> reveal

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
now we don't know there's no reveal

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.949 
now we don't know there's no reveal
trailer<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> can't<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.540> make<00:02:21.780> that

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
trailer so I can't really make that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.190 
trailer so I can't really make that
accurately<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.250> uh<00:02:23.310> anyway<00:02:24.019> without<00:02:25.019> further

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
accurately but uh anyway without further

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.289

battlefield<00:02:40.530> 4<00:02:40.829> or<00:02:41.010> something<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.519> but

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
battlefield 4 or something like that but

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.449 
battlefield 4 or something like that but
you<00:02:41.910> never<00:02:42.090> know<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:43.040> another<00:02:44.040> thing<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.310> want

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
you never know and another thing I want

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.979 
you never know and another thing I want
to<00:02:44.519> say<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.760> maybe<00:02:45.209> they're<00:02:45.599> not<00:02:45.630> going<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> go

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
to say is maybe they're not going to go

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.360 
to say is maybe they're not going to go
to<00:02:46.049> zombies<00:02:46.650> maybe<00:02:46.920> they're<00:02:47.040> gonna<00:02:47.130> go<00:02:47.280> with

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
to zombies maybe they're gonna go with

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.150 
to zombies maybe they're gonna go with
ghosts<00:02:47.880> never<00:02:48.690> thought<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:49.110> but<00:02:49.410> uh<00:02:49.470> hmm

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
ghosts never thought of that but uh hmm

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.979 
ghosts never thought of that but uh hmm
considering<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.209> game's<00:02:51.420> called<00:02:51.690> call<00:02:51.959> of

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
considering the game's called call of

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.630 
considering the game's called call of
duty<00:02:52.290> ghosts<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.980> probably<00:02:53.280> has<00:02:53.430> something

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
duty ghosts and probably has something

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.940 
duty ghosts and probably has something
to<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.209> campaign<00:02:54.930> considering<00:02:55.860> they

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
to do with the campaign considering they

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.729 
to do with the campaign considering they
all<00:02:56.099> do<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.480> titles<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.110> link<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.590> with

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
all do with the titles they link up with

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.819 
all do with the titles they link up with
the<00:02:58.769> campaign<00:02:59.400> mode<00:02:59.700> but<00:03:00.090> um<00:03:00.530> maybe<00:03:01.530> there

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
the campaign mode but um maybe there

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.110 
the campaign mode but um maybe there
will<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:01.980> some<00:03:02.489> kind<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.700> game<00:03:02.910> mode<00:03:03.090> called

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
will be some kind of game mode called

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.580 
will be some kind of game mode called
ghost<00:03:03.660> it'll<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.920> similar<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.730> of

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
ghost it'll be really similar to of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.470 
ghost it'll be really similar to of
zombies<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.950> yeah<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.700> never<00:03:08.910> know<00:03:09.209> I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
zombies so yeah but you never know I

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
zombies so yeah but you never know I
mean<00:03:10.019> I'm<00:03:10.139> pretty<00:03:10.170> sure<00:03:10.739> that'd<00:03:10.920> be<00:03:11.040> pretty

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
mean I'm pretty sure that'd be pretty

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.789 
mean I'm pretty sure that'd be pretty
dumb<00:03:11.880> if<00:03:12.209> Dom<00:03:12.510> or<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> bunch<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> ghosts<00:03:13.709> are

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
dumb if Dom or a bunch of ghosts are

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.099 
dumb if Dom or a bunch of ghosts are
chasing<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.120> mean<00:03:15.420> if<00:03:15.600> they<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.989> in

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
chasing you but I mean if they do it in

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.090 
chasing you but I mean if they do it in
a<00:03:16.260> orderly<00:03:17.160> fashion<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:18.060> actually<00:03:18.799> do<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.980> in

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
a orderly fashion and actually do it in

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.640 
a orderly fashion and actually do it in
a<00:03:20.220> pretty<00:03:20.940> good<00:03:21.090> way<00:03:21.269> than<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.200> actually<00:03:22.380> be

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
a pretty good way than it actually be

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530
