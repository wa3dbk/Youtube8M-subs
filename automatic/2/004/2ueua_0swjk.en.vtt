 tee 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.030
 Moody jpg 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.460
 tee 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.280
 Kenny Sagawa of the webike channel navigator is to introduce this time 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.670
 Muffler lip for yzf r 25 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.670
 It is a power box that has been released from special parts Tadou 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 me 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:59.140
 Yes this is a power box but it's a power box or its name 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.739
 It is the origin of naming, but this opposite is the other side as you look closely 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.760
 There is a small cylindrical Otsu here . 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:11.490
 Yes this is it real is I know the power box 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.840
 The secret here is what kind of secret If you say so, the easy place is expansion room 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.040
 I often say chamber 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.070
 This is not attached by this 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.760
 Physically impossible with this short tube 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:29.960
 Enhancing the silencing effect than high large silencer clogging is ensured here the space 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.360
 After all, there are times when it comes to earning so much back pressure. 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.850
 After that 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.640
 The exhaust pipe length and so on that determine the performance of the muffler is also difficult with pine and Kanda 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:48.220
 I though this Looking at it I And from this outside I've been supplemented with this power box 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.470
 It is a compact type that is almost invisible and a complete failure , but in fact its power 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.370
 I don't say that it's a shake by the box 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:01.900
 I think that I can say that it is approaching 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.900
 Let's listen to the sound of this power box right here 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.450
 t 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.610
 me 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.940
 It is a material here 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.070
 Both inner and outer cases 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.070
 Sten is it is not ultra-lightweight 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.870
 Buber that Otsu country school 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.459
 Look at the taste and weld 11 schools 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.280
 In theory called train 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:53.860
 The connecting snow subtle put out the r this shape itself was also a little beans Honpo strange 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.550
 It's powerful 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.790
 While conveying the design, its delicate 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.310
 It is that craftsmanship Both of them 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.610
 Say it was filled 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:12.220
 I think it's a very high satisfaction construction 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.410
 It is characteristic of the output though it is a normal muffler but it is a little around 6000 rotations 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.810
 I have heard that there is something to do 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:25.360
 Well after I lost the stagnation is and it filled the Tanioku is sp Tadao Special Parts 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.600
 By refers to just that clean out the ne its side is the thickness of the low and medium speed therefore is a characteristic of the brain 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.980
 Also about 3500 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.639
 And it 6000 a place in the flat I have been raised To a jerk or later, et al and the force has entered 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.439
 With the feeling that it will be released further and it will grow 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.180
 It feels like you actually got it, I think it's probably going to grow another one from around 9000 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:44.040
 I felt 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.620
 It's a shifter and a sound, but it's important for the morning 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.280
 Sound is this too 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.129
 There Well this powerful of this saw eye 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.320
 Shape and a 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:59.670
 It is a very powerful sound with a feeling of being sticky that is an image 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.710
 It's a copy that is teak 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.920
 I feel that 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:10.080
 And it's a replacement installation 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:15.550
 Remove wearing a normal muffler this this I'd put at the beginning here. 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:20.230
 Also for the degree of difficulty with the experimental You're that many complex movements remains 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:25.600
 There is no need for wind, etc. It's just really poking very easy. 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:27.289
 It's almost like a 30 minutes to remove the normal muffler and replace it here 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.900
 I think anyone can do it 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:34.040
 Naturally because it is government certified here, it is completely ok to threaten 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.300
 By all means 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.990
 See you Ford 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.990
 I think if you can enjoy the city riding touring around the day
