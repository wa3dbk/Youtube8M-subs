00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.310 

alright<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.329> when<00:00:51.329> you're<00:00:51.480> first<00:00:51.690> starting

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
alright so when you're first starting

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.400 
alright so when you're first starting
out<00:00:52.379> learning<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:53.670> idea<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
out learning this it's a good idea to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.170 
out learning this it's a good idea to
start<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.710> slow<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
start pretty slow so I'm going to just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
start pretty slow so I'm going to just
break<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> down<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.960> 60<00:00:58.350> BPM<00:00:59.600> here<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.079> here's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
break it down to 60 BPM here so here's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:29.859 
break it down to 60 BPM here so here's
what<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.280> sounds<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> 60<00:01:03.120> bpm

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.679 

so<00:01:31.399> as<00:01:32.399> you<00:01:32.549> start<00:01:32.819> getting<00:01:32.969> comfortable<00:01:33.270> with

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so as you start getting comfortable with

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.370 
so as you start getting comfortable with
it<00:01:34.289> at<00:01:34.409> 60<00:01:34.770> BPM<00:01:35.329> just<00:01:36.329> gradually<00:01:36.899> increase<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it at 60 BPM just gradually increase the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.940 
it at 60 BPM just gradually increase the
tempo<00:01:38.270> by<00:01:39.270> increments<00:01:39.569> of<00:01:39.929> two<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.469> from<00:01:40.709> there

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
tempo by increments of two so from there

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.789 
tempo by increments of two so from there
go<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> 62<00:01:42.000> bpm<00:01:42.539> play<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.469> couple<00:01:43.740> of
