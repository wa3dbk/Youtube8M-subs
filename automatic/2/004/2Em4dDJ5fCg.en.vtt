00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.730
 is more important due to the increase of barges and boats of all 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.089
 type that is used for maritime transshipment the review starts with 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.060

 boats is of paramount importance 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.820
 especially if they have to visit ports in many parts of the world 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.350
