 one 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.920
 passenger plane about to collide with 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.990
 a UFO in Scotland 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.750
 a recent report has revealed a 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.670
 strange encounter of a plane of 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.220
 passengers with a flying object not 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.940
 identified in the glasgow sky 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.870
 Scotland 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.810
 on December 2 a tree at 320 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.430
 with 220 passengers on board it was 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 Scottish approaching the airport 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.020
 glasgow when an unknown object 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.900
 happened to about 100 meters below him 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.490
 the pilot of the ship that was flying with the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.250
 landing lights on and on 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.590
 Good visibility conditions 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.380
 rated the risk of collision high 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.790
 with the object that had not appeared in 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.770
 the radar 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.660
 on Sunday the a so fast that the 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.450
 crew did not have occasion to 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.330
 register it really but both pilots 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.059
 they agreed that it was blue and 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.830
 yellow and with a small front area 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.110
 but no bigger than a balloon 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.270
 however the traffic controller 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.700
 aerial informed the pilot that the radar 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.940
 he had not registered the presence of another 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.650
 aircraft in the area then the pilot 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.870
 He expressed his intention to present a 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.000
 report to the board air products del 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.810
 united kingdom- which deals with these cases 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.880
 called quasi-accidents the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.800
 researchers have not been able to 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.300
 determine the nature of the object in 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.100
 question 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.750
 the investigation of the sources of 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.060
 available surveillance could not 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.910
 breathe any coincident activity 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
 with the one described by the pilot of the 320 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.750
 there was also no other information 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.850
 indicate the presence or absence of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.780
 activity in the area concludes the report 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.460
 of airbus also indicated that the members 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.230
 they could not come to a conclusion in 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.270
 regarding a possible candidate for 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.680
 ship in question and therefore it 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.450
 considered that the board did not have 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.040
 enough information to determine 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 the cause or the risk
