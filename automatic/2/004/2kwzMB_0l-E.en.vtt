00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.140
 and 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello to all guys come simple 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.190
 cities or the new section and this section 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.500
 let's talk about how to raise each week 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 a pokémon or how to do it in just 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.090
 five steps faster simpler and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.560
 we will learn much better many 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
 you asked for how to raise a pokémon 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 that I have to do pressure as 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.359
 I can do what is the best 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.980
 that pokemon then here in this section 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 let's talk about that pokemon every time 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 one different and do others are five 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.850
 steps and we go with the first step the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.560
 stacks that has that pokemon that has 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.390
 different than function we can give you that 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.949
 pokemon there we can check what 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 he has good pokemon and we can get him out 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.800
 the function why are we going to do that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.469
 pokemon in the case of dragon knight 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.359
 has very good are both in ps as 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.100
 attack as a little less defense to 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.690
 speed and then treat specializes 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 special also very high 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 so our dragon knight can 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.609
 do many functions properly that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.559
 doing in a little bit is the first thing 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.199
 to always look at the first step is 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.960
 you're looking at these pokemon and the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.280
 second step is the skills once 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.350
 we are clear these that have that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.090
 pokemon we have to look at the other 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.890
 part of pokemon the skill that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 skills has that extra attack is not going 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.010
 to give it to work this can not 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.690
 pokemon in the case 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.420
 unai has internal focus that avoids the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.770
 setback and compensation in the case of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 connect interests more compensation 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.510
 hidden ability of this pokemon since 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.520
 when he has all his fish the damage 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.260
 received happens to be half images a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.300
 ice radio would not take away for 4 you 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.800
 would remove by 2 because it has all life 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.230
 to top is always worth it when you have 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.030
 feet to the top this is the second step and the 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.040
 third step we go with him 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.750
 the attacks obviously after looking 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.640
 its stats that functions are going to achieve 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 that pokemon that is what has good and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.480
 then look at his ability as a second 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
 step we have to look at as a third step 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.400
 the attacks that attacks can be learned 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 pokemon to give it a different role or if 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.670
 well they learn a lot of support attacks or 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.400
 if they attack many attacks of attackers 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 physical or special or that acs pokemon and 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.150
 thanks to that to the movements 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 we can know it is the third step and very 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.500
 important attacks both by 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.690
 egg movement as per level as per 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.979
 emt is the third indispensable step and in 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.020
 the dragon knight case is a bit in 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.760
 what can a lot of attacks learn a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.229
 great repertoire of attacks because you can 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.360
 do the support of physical attackers 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.590
 of the special attacker of ha noi is what 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 that you want just from monaita 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.860
 they learn so many that that one position 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.520
 of the many attacks that dragon learns 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.440
 knight 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.210
 anger earthquake no fist fire and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.620
 many more do not piss me off all 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.780
 attacks in just one page this is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.850
 the third step and we go with the fourth the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.890
 nature logically after they look at what 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.660
 that has that pokemon the ability and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.490
 the attacks that nature is going to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.840
 play if we have some very attacks 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.700
 last night we would be interested in a nature 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.260
 more defensive as long as the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.300
 pokemon have good states that we have 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.190
 looked before in physical defense if not no 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.960
 if we do not put him in an attacker or 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.450
 firm or in happy or fearful or same 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.070
 of this this is the fourth step and very 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.620
 important but always by steps 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.660
 first the states second the skill 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.950
 third the attacks and fourth the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 nature that we are going to put to that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 pokemon that is of fifth step what is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.710
 the last step the fifth step is the most 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.720
 complicated of the pokemon once 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.150
 we have clear their stats the nature that 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.610
 let's play him the attacks all 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.560
 there are the sips and the eps many 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.330
 you will ask what the sips are and what they are 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.270
 the eps for now I'm going to summarize 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.820
 much the simpson k lite each pokemon 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.220
 has six hips that represent each 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.900
 be of the pokemon ps attack defense of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.180
 special speed attack according 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680
 and then there are the sets that are points 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.120
 that you can upload to those statistics 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.860
 to reach the maximum 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.750
 I have an explanatory video left in the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.629
 description which explained everything happened to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.730
 step like what are the sips and what are the 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.900
 eps here I'll tell you what 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.420
 what you have to do with that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.610
 at least five of the six possible types 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.829
 imagine that dragon is to use the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.079
 physical attacker who has the lic in life 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.090
 in physical attack in defense in speed 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.319
 and in special defense it will not matter if not 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.079
 they have it special attack since they do not 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.819
 are you using and then the ex 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.129
 it depends on how you want the pokemon there 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.140
 people who give him 252 sets in life for 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.160
 raise life to the limit when 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.340
 have the ipp that's why it's very important 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.540
 the sips and 252 in physical attack always 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.060
 when I have depp also the attack 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.709
 physical in the case of pokemon x and pokemon 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.599
 and the city ​​judge says so for tyc 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.950
 inside the pokemon center I say it in the 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.680
 explanatory video do not worry about not 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.780
 get lost and this is the last step to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.299
 put the pokemon one hundred percent 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.250
 we have ready and well done why I put 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.260
 below that depends on the nature and the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.060
 mobile set will depend the eps where only 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.109
 you are going to hand out you do not have fixed you do not have 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.419
 have to say that all because 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.070
 have the 205 gods alive or in a 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.710
 situation the sausages eps in attack 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.240
 physical does not depend on pokemon musset 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.819
 and nature will vary 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.479
 in this case if you have a bona by 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.130
 example attack 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.990
 attacker the physicist with angry earthquake 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.910
 of dragon dance and whatever you want and fist 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.560
 chrono for example you have to give in 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.740
 my case if you are not being andanza 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.970
 dragon you can put 256 speed 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.220
 200 in physical attack and those left over in 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.750
 life or do not pass the speed and put 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.400
 all life all physical attack because 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.020
 then you will show the speed as 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.690
 you want that is your choice 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.819
 but it is the fifth step and very important 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.069
 to do the pokemon in five steps and 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.810
 well it's pokemon in five steps just 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.860
 we will create and so fast this 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.690
 new situation I hope that I have 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.509
 liked a lot has helped us command 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.509
 very strong arms I love a lot and chao
