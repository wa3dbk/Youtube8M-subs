00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
can do for you in the blend shape so the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530 
can do for you in the blend shape so the
first<00:02:19.290> button<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:20.280> new<00:02:20.459> layer<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.420> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
notice within my layer palette I have to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.309 
notice within my layer palette I have to
the<00:02:23.190> minute<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.520> click<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.240> we're<00:02:25.200> all

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.470 
see my sub tools with the eyeballs on
are<00:03:50.040> only<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:51.030> top<00:03:51.239> two<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.769> these<00:03:53.340> top<00:03:54.180> two

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
are only the top two so these top two

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.600 
are only the top two so these top two
sub<00:03:55.110> tools<00:03:55.350> will<00:03:55.500> be<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.769> only<00:03:55.980> ones<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.519> get

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
sub tools will be the only ones that get

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.690 
sub tools will be the only ones that get
sent<00:03:56.820> into<00:03:57.060> Maya<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:58.410> yellow<00:03:58.620> button<00:03:58.920> would

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
sent into Maya the yellow button would

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.750 
sent into Maya the yellow button would
be<00:03:59.880> sending<00:04:00.269> all<00:04:00.570> sub<00:04:01.230> tools<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.250> sends<00:04:02.519> all

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
be sending all sub tools so it sends all

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.340 
be sending all sub tools so it sends all
ten<00:04:03.060> sub<00:04:03.360> tools<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> have<00:04:04.049> for<00:04:04.260> this

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
ten sub tools that I have for this

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.000 
ten sub tools that I have for this
particular<00:04:04.530> sculpt<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:06.600> let's<00:04:07.079> see<00:04:07.650> what<00:04:07.829> this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
particular sculpt so let's see what this

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.210 
particular sculpt so let's see what this
can<00:04:08.310> do<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.700> I'm<00:04:08.820> going<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.030> click<00:04:09.450> on<00:04:09.570> visible

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
can do so I'm going to click on visible

my top let's go I have that smirk again

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.900 
my top let's go I have that smirk again
and<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:35.550> have<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.910> eyes<00:04:36.150> being<00:04:36.570> closed<00:04:37.910> so

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
and I have the eyes being closed so

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.600 
and I have the eyes being closed so
again<00:04:39.150> this<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.750> going<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.200> send<00:04:40.530> each<00:04:41.160> one<00:04:41.490> of

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
again this is going to send each one of

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.890 
again this is going to send each one of
these<00:04:41.730> layers<00:04:42.050> into<00:04:43.050> Maya<00:04:43.260> as<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.650> blend<00:04:44.340> shape

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
these layers into Maya as a blend shape

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.330 
these layers into Maya as a blend shape
so<00:04:45.900> that's<00:04:46.110> what<00:04:46.290> this<00:04:46.440> final<00:04:46.830> button<00:04:47.010> does

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
so that's what this final button does

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.090 
so that's what this final button does
and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.480> click<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:49.169> export<00:04:49.620> blend

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
I've sent over multiple layers into Maya

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.540 
I've sent over multiple layers into Maya
and<00:05:40.950> have<00:05:41.220> them<00:05:41.400> acting<00:05:41.880> as<00:05:42.090> blend<00:05:42.419> shapes<00:05:43.550> so

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
and have them acting as blend shapes so

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.560

of what this plugin can do you can see
the<00:05:49.890> power<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.580> being<00:05:51.240> able<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.630> send<00:05:52.110> layers

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
the power of being able to send layers

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.029 
the power of being able to send layers
back<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.580> forth<00:05:53.850> through<00:05:54.660> Maya<00:05:54.900> if<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:55.770> was<00:05:55.919> to

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
back and forth through Maya if I was to

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.640 
back and forth through Maya if I was to
add<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.220> layer<00:05:56.610> on<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:57.510> this<00:05:58.080> would<00:05:58.380> update

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
add a layer on to here this would update

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.430 
add a layer on to here this would update
on<00:05:59.220> my<00:06:00.000> blend<00:06:00.270> shape<00:06:00.510> going<00:06:00.780> over<00:06:01.140> to<00:06:01.260> Maya

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
on my blend shape going over to Maya

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.190 
on my blend shape going over to Maya
anything<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.220> would<00:06:02.340> want<00:06:02.550> to<00:06:02.640> add<00:06:02.930> to<00:06:03.930> another

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
anything I would want to add to another

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.650 
anything I would want to add to another
layer<00:06:04.470> and<00:06:05.190> let's<00:06:05.610> just<00:06:05.820> change<00:06:06.060> his<00:06:06.390> nose<00:06:06.630> up

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
layer and let's just change his nose up

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.800 
layer and let's just change his nose up
a<00:06:06.990> little<00:06:07.169> bit<00:06:07.380> so<00:06:08.370> we'll<00:06:08.550> switch<00:06:08.700> to<00:06:08.820> our<00:06:09.390> move

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
a little bit so we'll switch to our move

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.529 
a little bit so we'll switch to our move
brushes<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:11.250> I'll<00:06:11.460> just<00:06:11.640> make<00:06:12.120> his<00:06:12.300> nose<00:06:12.479> a

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
brushes and I'll just make his nose a

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.870 
brushes and I'll just make his nose a
little<00:06:12.750> smaller<00:06:13.200> I'm<00:06:13.979> actually<00:06:14.250> put<00:06:14.640> that<00:06:14.760> on

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
little smaller I'm actually put that on

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.800 
little smaller I'm actually put that on
a<00:06:14.910> layer<00:06:15.320> so<00:06:16.320> we'll<00:06:16.590> really<00:06:16.770> extreme<00:06:17.600> so<00:06:18.600> now<00:06:18.780> I

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
a layer so we'll really extreme so now I

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.529 
a layer so we'll really extreme so now I
have<00:06:19.080> a<00:06:19.410> new<00:06:19.710> layer<00:06:19.950> that<00:06:20.640> changes<00:06:21.150> his<00:06:21.300> nose
