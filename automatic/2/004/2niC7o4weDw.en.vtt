00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.990
 what the rich do know very well is that 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 they do not change their time for money ie 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 they do not sell hours at a price that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 be that price because because the time 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.369
 is limited people have some 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.950
 hours to work during the day 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.360
 can be 8 can be 10 can be 12 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.000
 but they can not be more of that during 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.820
 a day so for very high that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 bandages every hour you can never go from 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.930
 that roof and those hours so they 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.260
 they understand what they have to do 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.000
 is to sell knowledge or sell about 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 benefits of your products and services 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.070
 but never sell your time if you sell 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.440
 time you can never be rich good 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 rich people know that you have to have several 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.100
 sources of income not a several 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.949
 sources of income usually the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.449
 people are educated to have 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.519
 only a source of income and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.640
 we think about a job or we even think 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.819
 in a business in a trade however 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.800
 rich people collect sources 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.500
 of income that is to say they have several 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 sources of income diversify their 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 income sources can have 5 10 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.830
 which are because because if one does not 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 works always have others that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.210
 complement those ingredients so 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.240
 what we have to have are several 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.010
 sources of income not only one 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.570
 well normally people who do not 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.520
 they have a lot of money that relate the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 money with suffering with having a bad time 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.660
 that is to say the work is something painful and without 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.160
 However , there are so many 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.070
 people who are very rich are 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.690
 immensely rich and they continue to work and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.720
 if they do it is not for more inside is 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.360
 because they like it so they link passion 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890
 with wealth rich people and without 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 However, people who are not rich 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.900
 link work with something painful for 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 So what to do there 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 to dedicate ourselves to things that we are passionate about 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.440
 that we like to do what we would do even 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.290
 free but we will not do it for free and if 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.270
 we do so we will be almost essential 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.370
 We will be valuable and we will deliver something with 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.080
 much value and people the 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.510
 will reward therefore we have to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.320
 introduce passion in our work 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.320
 or in our business
