00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.590
 Hansa Rostock vs VfL Bochum dfb-cup 30th of July 2011 they lower strange 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.480
 The workers fight the strange Kenzie means Dirk draws and a victory 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.269
 for book Rome of the many 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.869
 Game in the first round of the 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.400
 dfb cups that will be held on Saturday we have 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.359
 the most interesting to analyze 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.779
 selected 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.369
 Here are two former first division clubs who have descended and pretty much 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.619
 bad the season have opened each other 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.210
 it's interesting that they met each other the last time 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.130
 Members of 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.989
 first Bundesliga in 2008 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.590
 At that time Hansa has celebrated a 2 to 1 the topics break around 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.990
 Hansa has regularly won in the first Bundesliga being in the two 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.170
 second league duels Bochum triumphed but that was five years ago 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.720
 30 Tel July 2011 to 19:30 the team from Rostock has the new 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.890
 Season opened with a completely unexpected defeat against Paderborn 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.780
 the Rostock want to avoid the descent into the third league at any price and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 so they were quite shaken by this defeat 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.979
 In the away game in Dresden they have delivered a better match and 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.400
 got a point one-on-one draw from this game has multiple 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.909
 Significance because in addition to the points you gain your self-confidence 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.720
 restored because the enemy was one 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.740
 arch rivals out of the post 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.260
 the cup is not in the foreground but a victory against pogroms would be theirs 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.570
 Improve mood a little bit 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 Coach Vollmann has certain problems with the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.480
 first two rounds did not change too big 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.280
 the striker pushes in the first round 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.690
 Light plays he was replaced 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.010
 Vollmann replaces the still Perthel by Pannewitz but that was not exactly the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.410
 best solution 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.560
 Problems cause them blockages and injuries 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.490
 Panelbiz and Semmer are locked for this game during the shooter of 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.490
 Tores in Dresden Ziegenbein is struck 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.599
 nevertheless he should run up 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.339
 Pannewitz is represented by the Perthel 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.239
 "Since Simmer is not there, Wirtz's got another chance 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.829
 as the team remains unchanged 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.340
 the team is led by the experienced Marek Mintal 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:34.309

 VfL Bochum opened the season not much better than tame 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.489
 however, losing to Fortuna in the first round can not 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 surprising considering the strength of the opponent 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.619
 Much more worry makes them the second game against the weak FSV Frankfurt 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.009
 in their own stadium 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:12.399
 it was expected that the Bochum demonstrate their power in this game 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.669
 and show why they are one of the main candidates for promotion 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.029
 they have the minimum victory two minutes before the end 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:25.659
 The game was brought in by the impact of Kim Krick's substitution 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.659
 was and turned out to be a proper sammer shopping service 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:34.629
 it is interesting that Federico came in together with the go 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.569
 the original was made to score 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.399
 Nevertheless, these two players in Rostock are not from the first minute 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:44.279
 to be there 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:48.559

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.669

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.909
 Rest of the team remains unchanged and that means the pogrom the second 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.709
 Wants to reach round 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.949
 if you want to win you measure the goals and settlements because you improve 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.189
 Goal in two matches for a team The big ambitions have pretty little 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.079

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.329

 Altena 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 this game could be very hard and uncertain 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.030
 Both teams want victory but this victory does not mean injury 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.449
 pay 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.800
 they will come up with the best available crews but certainly 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.110
 they will be very careful 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.089
 in such a game we can not expect a goal rich game 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.810
 Bochum also has problems with the Tor implementation
