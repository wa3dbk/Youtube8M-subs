own<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> concept<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.770> opera<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:11.060> they<00:01:12.060> may

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
own the concept of opera so they may

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.140 
own the concept of opera so they may
well<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.810> making<00:01:13.799> their<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.189> fist<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.820> but

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.609 
well be making their best fist of it but
that's<00:01:15.659> why<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> thought<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> would<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.409> good<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that's why I thought it would be good to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.289 
that's why I thought it would be good to
bring<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.610> bit<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.970> strange

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
attractor it's a bit like the problem

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
attractor it's a bit like the problem
