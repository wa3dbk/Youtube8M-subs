Dolph<00:02:43.290> Ziggler<00:02:43.620> ain't<00:02:43.770> exactly<00:02:43.860> light<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
Dolph Ziggler ain't exactly light in the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.160 
Dolph Ziggler ain't exactly light in the
world<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.820> fire<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:45.240> his<00:02:45.360> promos<00:02:45.600> either<00:02:45.990> in

world on fire with his promos either in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
world on fire with his promos either in
fact<00:02:46.320> Danzig<00:02:46.800> was<00:02:46.980> pretty<00:02:47.130> goddamn<00:02:47.340> terrible

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
fact Danzig was pretty goddamn terrible

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.100 
fact Danzig was pretty goddamn terrible
on<00:02:48.500> promos<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.650> WWE<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:51.810> there's<00:02:52.050> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
on promos in WWE so I think there's a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.540 
on promos in WWE so I think there's a
lot<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> similarities<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.160> him<00:02:53.400> and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
lot of similarities with him and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.460 
lot of similarities with him and
Morrison<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> say<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.570> go<00:02:54.990> for<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> gold

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
Morrison so I say just go for the gold

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.230 
Morrison so I say just go for the gold
here<00:02:55.710> just<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.100> exactly<00:02:56.490> what<00:02:56.640> Morrison<00:02:57.060> did

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
here just do exactly what Morrison did

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.120 
here just do exactly what Morrison did
and<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.960> lucha<00:02:58.290> underground<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.920> think

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and go to lucha underground I think

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.200 
and go to lucha underground I think
Dolph<00:02:59.340> Ziggler<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.850> lucha<00:03:00.150> underground

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
Dolph Ziggler and lucha underground

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.930 
Dolph Ziggler and lucha underground
would<00:03:00.720> be<00:03:00.900> would<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.550> fun<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
would be would be really really fun and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.390 
would be would be really really fun and
the<00:03:03.840> matches<00:03:04.230> he<00:03:04.320> could<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.650> with<00:03:04.860> Morrison

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the matches he could have with Morrison

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.960

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
and Puma and all those guys and probably

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
and Puma and all those guys and probably
have<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.750> lot<00:03:09.930> better<00:03:10.110> chance<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.650> be<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> top<00:03:11.160> guy

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
have a lot better chance to be a top guy
