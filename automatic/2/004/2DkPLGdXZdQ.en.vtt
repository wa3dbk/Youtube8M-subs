00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.740
 dear dear parents friends 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.360
 we are again together here to talk 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.090
 a little about us and our children 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.640
 good as good as there is a question 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.310
 very often that I was just 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.849
 make its autonomous and now the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 transmitted and if they ask me how much 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:32.520
 it can affect children seeing 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 television with excess still being good 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 good educational programs or programs 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.040
 the truth that if I can not tell you 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.610
 a lot if they see 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.240
 our program this music 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.660
 but speaking seriously look while the 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.750
 children are smaller less time 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.450
 they can be on television in their first 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.970
 we would say that childhood lasts until 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.380
 4 to 6 years according to different 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.690
 opinions 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.240
 they have almost absolutely no 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.440
 nothing but nothing of snow white and the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 seven dwarfs' nobody 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.540
 and then when the years go by 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.190
 you can go see a little more we are going to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 think about teenage boys 16 18 years 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.370
 in that age still being programs 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.920
 educational 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.159
 global psychotherapy 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.970
 interested in the system warn us that 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.210
 two hours of television per day already 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 they produce a watched TV that is to say a boy 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.619
 that will be aware of the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.830
 TV goes itself will 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.890
 have difficulties in relationships going 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.899
 you have to block your initiative 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.000
 because television makes it passive be 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.180
 all the time like this 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.850
 also creativity and also the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.620
 development of their intelligence so 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.900
 that you have to know how to handle television 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.080
 dads and often you have to 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.670
 replace it with other entertainment 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.520
 other occupations and other 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.100
 responsibilities well I know that you 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.090
 I like television I already know but good 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.520
 but your children are first then 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.920
 hey dinner time does not turn on the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.310
 television rather I conversed with his 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.310
 children
