00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
that I posted the photo of that I use

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.600 
that I posted the photo of that I use

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
previously and so this is how it's used

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.630 
previously and so this is how it's used
um<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.210> had<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:24.740> notorious<00:00:25.740> custard<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.520> my

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
um I had the notorious custard in my

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.830 
um I had the notorious custard in my

hair already and you know but it's been

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.250 
hair already and you know but it's been
a<00:00:30.869> few<00:00:31.609> minutes<00:00:32.609> probably<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.269> maybe<00:00:34.019> an

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
a few minutes probably like maybe an

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
a few minutes probably like maybe an
hour<00:00:34.379> at<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> point<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.570> going

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
hour at this point and so I'm just going

hour at this point and so I'm just going
to<00:00:36.899> read<00:00:37.200> wet<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.620> hair<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.579> my<00:00:38.820> leave-in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
to read wet my hair with my leave-in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
to read wet my hair with my leave-in
conditioner<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:53.870> okay<00:00:54.870> okay<00:00:56.000> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
conditioner so that I'm not okay okay so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
conditioner so that I'm not okay okay so
all<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.440> done<00:00:58.829> is<00:01:00.230> is<00:01:01.340> rolled<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:04.219> around<00:01:05.219> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
all this done is is rolled and around to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.249 
all this done is is rolled and around to
motion<00:01:05.880> doesn't<00:01:06.329> matter<00:01:06.479> what<00:01:06.630> direction<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
motion doesn't matter what direction I

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.330 
motion doesn't matter what direction I
just<00:01:07.560> happen<00:01:07.889> to<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.279> handed<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.319> I'm

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
just happen to be right handed so I'm

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.330 
just happen to be right handed so I'm
rolling<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.819> direction<00:01:12.469> and<00:01:13.469> you<00:01:14.039> see

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
rolling in this direction and you see

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.040 
rolling in this direction and you see
what's<00:01:14.520> happening

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.100 

I'm<00:01:21.050> not<00:01:21.200> using<00:01:21.440> a<00:01:21.830> lot<00:01:22.400> of<00:01:22.460> pressure<00:01:22.840> I'm<00:01:23.840> just

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
I'm not using a lot of pressure I'm just

00:01:24.110 --> 00:02:26.630 
I'm not using a lot of pressure I'm just
rolling

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.720 

so<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.660> doesn't<00:02:27.960> normally<00:02:28.080> take<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.830> long<00:02:29.520> time

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
so it doesn't normally take a long time

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.170 
so it doesn't normally take a long time
and<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:31.620> think<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.370> also<00:02:32.580> did<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.000> one

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and I think because I also did this one

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.940 
and I think because I also did this one
my<00:02:33.300> hair<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.690> normally<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> little<00:02:34.440> more<00:02:34.650> moist

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
my hair is normally a little more moist

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.600 
my hair is normally a little more moist
but<00:02:37.950> anyway<00:02:38.870> hit<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.900> point<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.400> little

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
but anyway hit the point it's a little

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.040 
but anyway hit the point it's a little
bit<00:02:41.700> more<00:02:41.850> defined<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:42.390> than<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.750> was<00:02:42.810> before

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
bit more defined now than it was before

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.920 
bit more defined now than it was before
and<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:46.380> want<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:48.000> little<00:02:48.240> bit<00:02:48.510> cleaner

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and I want to do it a little bit cleaner

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
and I want to do it a little bit cleaner
over<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.520> back<00:02:53.520> before<00:02:53.910> hopefully

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
over here in the back before hopefully

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:10.699 
over here in the back before hopefully
looks<00:02:54.570> okay<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.290> we<00:03:10.380> go

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
looks okay and here we go

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:21.470 
looks okay and here we go
I<00:03:12.620> do<00:03:13.620> put<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.980> little<00:03:14.160> bit<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:16.550> edge<00:03:17.550> control<00:03:20.480> on

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
I do put a little bit of edge control on

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.520 
I do put a little bit of edge control on
the<00:03:21.870> front<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.390> edges<00:03:24.900> lay<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> little

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
the front so that my edges lay a little

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.050 
the front so that my edges lay a little
bit<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:28.290> they're<00:03:28.590> not<00:03:28.770> just<00:03:28.850> super<00:03:29.850> frizzy

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
bit and they're not just super frizzy

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.490 
bit and they're not just super frizzy
okay<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.810> too<00:03:33.989> much<00:03:35.989> that's<00:03:36.989> right<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
okay that is too much that's right a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:04:05.430 
okay that is too much that's right a
little<00:03:37.680> bit

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.200 

I<00:04:05.500> guess<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.340> should<00:04:06.520> put<00:04:06.670> some<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.000> back

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
I guess I should put some in the back

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:38.590 
I guess I should put some in the back
you<00:04:08.200> know<00:04:08.350> what's<00:04:08.500> going<00:04:08.740> on<00:04:08.860> back<00:04:08.980> there

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.770 

we're<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.560> long<00:04:39.770> that's<00:04:40.040> crazy<00:04:40.420> this<00:04:41.420> is<00:04:41.480> like

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
we're so long that's crazy this is like

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.189 
we're so long that's crazy this is like
super<00:04:42.080> long<00:04:42.380> for<00:04:42.710> me

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.649 

I'm<00:04:47.800> not<00:04:48.189> getting<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.669> shape<00:04:48.909> up<00:04:49.150> because<00:04:49.539> I'm

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
I'm not getting the shape up because I'm

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.739 
I'm not getting the shape up because I'm
going<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.990> get<00:04:50.110> frayed<00:04:50.379> so<00:04:50.830> this<00:04:51.039> is<00:04:51.749> really

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:52.749 
going to get frayed so this is really

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.959 
going to get frayed so this is really
ready<00:04:53.349> to<00:04:53.439> test<00:04:53.620> my<00:04:53.770> patience<00:04:54.189> back<00:04:54.370> here<00:04:55.949> but

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
ready to test my patience back here but

ready to test my patience back here but
okay<00:04:57.969> so<00:04:58.539> I'm<00:04:58.599> happy<00:04:58.779> with<00:04:58.900> how<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.259> looks

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
okay so I'm happy with how this looks

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.920 
okay so I'm happy with how this looks

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
get a little bit more definition not too

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.519 
get a little bit more definition not too
much<00:05:02.110> but<00:05:02.560> um<00:05:03.599> there<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:04.629> go<00:05:04.779> that's<00:05:05.199> how<00:05:05.409> you

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:05.529 
much but um there you go that's how you

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.319 
much but um there you go that's how you
use<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:06.689> magic<00:05:07.689> of<00:05:07.990> sponge
