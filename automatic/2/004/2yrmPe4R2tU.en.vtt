tells<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.290> maybe<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.520> ex<00:01:38.729> seeds<00:01:39.119> can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
tells me that maybe the ex seeds can

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780 
tells me that maybe the ex seeds can
actually<00:01:40.170> come<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.130> defend<00:01:41.579> themselves

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
actually come to defend themselves

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
actually come to defend themselves
rather<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.899> relying<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.439> their<00:01:43.710> dragon

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
rather than just relying on their dragon

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.300 
rather than just relying on their dragon
slaying<00:01:44.460> parents<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.750> hopefully<00:01:46.320> happy<00:01:47.040> gives

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
slaying parents so hopefully happy gives

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060 
slaying parents so hopefully happy gives

way to defend themselves other than Lily

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
way to defend themselves other than Lily
because<00:02:13.930> he's<00:02:14.140> always<00:02:14.320> been<00:02:14.590> badass<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.610> this

because he's always been badass but this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.220 
because he's always been badass but this
this<00:02:16.870> has<00:02:16.930> me<00:02:17.560> very<00:02:17.890> very<00:02:18.660> hopeful<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.720> maybe

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
this has me very very hopeful that maybe

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.350 
this has me very very hopeful that maybe
since<00:02:20.920> she<00:02:21.130> talked<00:02:21.370> about<00:02:21.610> magic<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.180> some

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
since she talked about magic and some

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.300 
since she talked about magic and some
other<00:02:22.540> stuff<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.020> chapter<00:02:23.320> maybe<00:02:23.890> Carl

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
other stuff in this chapter maybe Carl

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.250 
other stuff in this chapter maybe Carl
and<00:02:24.520> happy<00:02:24.850> can<00:02:25.030> actually<00:02:25.390> become<00:02:25.540> wizards

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
and happy can actually become wizards

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.050 
and happy can actually become wizards
and<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.590> their<00:02:26.740> own<00:02:26.890> techniques<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.760> whatnot

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and have their own techniques of whatnot

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.030 
and have their own techniques of whatnot
that<00:02:28.270> would<00:02:28.600> be<00:02:28.720> awesome<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.230> also<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> happy

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
that would be awesome and also a happy

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.000 
that would be awesome and also a happy
didn't<00:02:30.490> orgasm<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.630> much<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.320> thought<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
didn't orgasm as much as I thought that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.010 
didn't orgasm as much as I thought that
he<00:02:33.550> would<00:02:33.790> anyway<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:34.540> neither<00:02:34.660> here<00:02:34.810> nor

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
he would anyway that's neither here nor

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.740 
he would anyway that's neither here nor
there<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.920> we<00:02:36.340> all<00:02:36.520> know<00:02:36.880> by<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.210> end<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.660> this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
there but we all know by the end of this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.510 
there but we all know by the end of this
probably<00:02:38.290> right<00:02:38.500> after<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.040> fight<00:02:39.340> that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
probably right after this fight that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.370 
probably right after this fight that
they're<00:02:39.700> about<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.270> Wendy<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:40.990> going<00:02:41.260> to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.020 
join Natsu on this hunt for Fairy Tail
and<00:02:44.020> there's<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.980> few<00:02:45.130> other<00:02:45.280> things<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.850> they

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
and there's a few other things like they

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.970 
and there's a few other things like they
can't<00:02:46.300> find<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.750> where<00:02:46.990> Makarov<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:47.890> he

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
can't find out where Makarov is and he

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.040 
can't find out where Makarov is and he

was supposed to join the council but he

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.560 
was supposed to join the council but he
apparently<00:02:50.980> either<00:02:51.340> ran<00:02:51.700> away<00:02:51.820> or<00:02:52.180> did

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
apparently either ran away or did

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.570 
apparently either ran away or did
something<00:02:52.840> else<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.470> happy<00:02:54.010> he<00:02:54.100> was<00:02:54.280> said<00:02:54.430> he

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
something else and happy he was said he

something else and happy he was said he

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
may have died which was fucked up we all

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.260 
may have died which was fucked up we all
know<00:02:56.560> Makarov<00:02:56.980> isn't<00:02:57.370> dead<00:02:57.550> yet<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:57.970> next

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
know Makarov isn't dead yet but next

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.910

chapter<00:02:58.630> things<00:02:58.990> that<00:02:59.230> we're<00:02:59.350> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.620> see

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
chapter things that we're going to see

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.950 
chapter things that we're going to see
what<00:03:00.190> windy<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.730> chilly<00:03:00.790> could<00:03:01.390> actually<00:03:01.540> do

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
what windy and chilly could actually do

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.420 
what windy and chilly could actually do
I<00:03:02.200> thought<00:03:02.590> we<00:03:02.740> were<00:03:02.830> going<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.040> get<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.280> this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
I thought we were going to get that this

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.550 
I thought we were going to get that this
chapter<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.330> said<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.930> may<00:03:05.380> have

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
chapter but like I said I may have

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.590 
chapter but like I said I may have
misinterpreted<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.490> last<00:03:06.940> page<00:03:07.270> of<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
misinterpreted the last page of the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.450 
misinterpreted the last page of the
previous<00:03:07.990> chapter<00:03:08.440> but<00:03:08.830> least<00:03:09.010> we're<00:03:09.190> getting

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
previous chapter but least we're getting

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.320 
previous chapter but least we're getting
it<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.760> I'm<00:03:09.880> pretty<00:03:10.120> sure<00:03:10.270> Wendy<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.650> at

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
it and I'm pretty sure Wendy is at

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.120 
it and I'm pretty sure Wendy is at
Shelia's<00:03:13.330> level<00:03:13.840> before<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.530> time-skip

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
Shelia's level before the time-skip

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.220 
Shelia's level before the time-skip
or<00:03:15.310> above<00:03:15.790> because<00:03:16.239> we<00:03:16.420> knew<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.600> chilly<00:03:17.020> it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
or above because we knew that chilly it

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.770 
or above because we knew that chilly it
could<00:03:17.350> heal<00:03:17.560> herself<00:03:17.830> which<00:03:18.760> was<00:03:18.970> unheard<00:03:19.239> of

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
could heal herself which was unheard of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.960 
could heal herself which was unheard of
until<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.320> point<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.130> maybe<00:03:21.400> windy<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:21.910> do

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
until that point so maybe windy can do

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.640 
until that point so maybe windy can do
that<00:03:22.120> now<00:03:22.270> there'll<00:03:22.540> be<00:03:22.630> epic<00:03:23.020> maybe<00:03:23.260> she<00:03:23.500> can

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
that now there'll be epic maybe she can

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.530 
that now there'll be epic maybe she can
use<00:03:23.830> her<00:03:23.860> dragon<00:03:24.370> drive<00:03:24.580> because<00:03:24.880> her<00:03:25.180> dragon

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
use her dragon drive because her dragon

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.570 
use her dragon drive because her dragon
drive<00:03:25.720> was<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.440> was<00:03:26.650> delicious<00:03:27.040> I'm<00:03:27.280> not<00:03:27.400> going

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
drive was it was delicious I'm not going

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.760 
drive was it was delicious I'm not going
to<00:03:27.730> lie<00:03:27.880> her<00:03:28.480> transformation<00:03:28.989> was<00:03:29.380> epic

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
to lie her transformation was epic

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.460 
to lie her transformation was epic
especially<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:30.520> you've<00:03:30.670> seen<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.090> actual

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
especially if you've seen the actual

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.020 
especially if you've seen the actual
colored<00:03:32.470> version<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.550> believe<00:03:33.820> her

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
colored version of that I believe her

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.510 
colored version of that I believe her
hair<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.390> pink<00:03:34.690> her<00:03:35.260> whole<00:03:35.709> body<00:03:36.010> underwent

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
hair is pink her whole body underwent

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.010 
hair is pink her whole body underwent
the<00:03:36.640> transformation<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.360> really<00:03:37.600> can't<00:03:37.840> tell

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
the transformation you really can't tell

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.380 
the transformation you really can't tell
in<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.350> manga<00:03:38.680> but<00:03:38.890> she<00:03:39.700> was<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:40.030> one<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.270> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
in the manga but she was on one of the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.180 
in the manga but she was on one of the
manga<00:03:40.690> covers<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:41.200> she<00:03:41.380> looked<00:03:41.590> epic<00:03:41.980> so

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
manga covers and she looked epic so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.949 
manga covers and she looked epic so
hopefully<00:03:42.760> she<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.000> just<00:03:43.300> pull<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.570> out<00:03:43.750> of

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
hopefully she can just pull that out of

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.330 
hopefully she can just pull that out of
nowhere<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.380> sting<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:44.890> rogue<00:03:45.070> and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
nowhere like sting and rogue and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.310 
nowhere like sting and rogue and
speaking<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.820> staying<00:03:46.030> rogue<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.630> really<00:03:47.170> want

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
speaking of staying rogue I really want

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.870 
speaking of staying rogue I really want
