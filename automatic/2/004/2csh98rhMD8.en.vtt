00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.410
 the 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.470
 only the state aid this week I always have to ask 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.470
 how to have a screen test on your phone 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.059
 We see that has is often included in cleaning cloth and usually 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.820
 you find the packaging of art criticism and medeski the sutter nice and smooth 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:20.720
 apply 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 the numbers can be plotted with the city so that it cannot jump undone 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.480
 during the pasting 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.270
 that the device then cools down briefly because every telephone produces 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.380
 heat it is good that, however, it does not stick well 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.740
 meanwhile you can fix the screen flat is still free with the scheveninger 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.250
 in scream 3 nature simply faces east and then the screen 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.350
 Get it with the included cleaning cloth it is handy when you get it 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.039
 one and as many dust-free environments as possible 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.199
 there are few stewed pears left on the phone after cleaning 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.730
 After cleaning, grab and screen away game when we see two sides 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.550
 but also two steps 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.070
 The first step is the side that is on the screen that we go first 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.740
 the layer for a bit further 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.970
 it is useful if you have not completely finished this layer because you 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.300
 discriminate, however, would hold on better 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.650
 Cell advanced the bottom of a screen protector well eventually 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.850
 relative to the screen and so bad with sticking and will do the rest of it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.670
 quintet also end up in the right place 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.080
 You can follow these games with the thesis to the ski bus that you 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 to apply immediately 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.720
 while pasting he meanwhile the other side of the script that there 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.860
 trains slower 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.560
 You then see that the pourer time is neat on the device until all openings 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.430
 have remained tidy 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.840
 It is always some more games that are side by side and you can easily do this 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 seduce when moving over with discussion about cleaning cloth and to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 to eliminate the side like that 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.400
 very small games are left over and usually move away within a day 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.410
 if not then you can try again to pull them away 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.160
 Then you can protect the top layer of the ship's thanks 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.410
 pickup, fetch 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.710
 you can be so that you find out that there is still a small substance somewhere 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.320
 supports then you don't even have to figure out the time, but you can 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.260
 dissolve with a small piece of tape 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.630
 This allows you to steal a part of the quintet that you have a merger on 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.190
 another piece of tape could easily seduce the field 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.930
 however, the skiffhead then returned to its time with the help of 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.930
 is critical and you can carefully drive a piece of tape again 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.619
 yuniesky i have the most them that fits your phone then go 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.999
 to such a point nl or pc per year and if you have a screen protector there today 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.849
 you ordered and delivered to your house tomorrow for watching and that it still 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.929
 once 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:28.599
