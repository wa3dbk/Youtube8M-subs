00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
hi I'm tuning committee bowl design and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.420 
hi I'm tuning committee bowl design and
this<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:48.070> next<00:00:49.070> version<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:51.430> Voodoo

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
this is a next version of the Voodoo

this is a next version of the Voodoo
stove<00:00:52.790> I'm<00:00:53.000> working<00:00:53.420> on<00:00:53.860> probably<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:54.920> going

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
stove I'm working on probably is going

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.619 
stove I'm working on probably is going
to<00:00:55.190> end<00:00:55.309> up<00:00:55.370> being<00:00:55.640> called<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:56.000> mu<00:00:56.180> do<00:00:56.329> just

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
to end up being called a mu do just

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.990 
to end up being called a mu do just
because<00:00:56.750> it's<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.110> neat<00:00:57.290> name<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.430> pretty

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
because it's a neat name and it pretty

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.930 
because it's a neat name and it pretty
much<00:00:59.089> matches<00:00:59.540> all<00:00:59.870> my<00:01:00.019> other<00:01:00.199> names<00:01:00.500> like

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
much matches all my other names like

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.439 
much matches all my other names like
questionable<00:01:01.940> mental<00:01:02.120> health<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
questionable mental health and

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.940 
questionable mental health and
substandard<00:01:05.449> remote<00:01:06.050> and<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.410> rest<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.800> them

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
substandard remote and the rest of them

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.060 
substandard remote and the rest of them
so<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:07.520> will<00:01:07.670> probably<00:01:07.940> be<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> MU<00:01:08.540> do<00:01:09.070> I've

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
so this will probably be the MU do I've

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.219 
so this will probably be the MU do I've
gone<00:01:10.310> back<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.000> Rima<00:01:11.360> sheen<00:01:11.630> dever<00:01:11.900> ething

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
gone back and Rima sheen dever ething

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.580 
gone back and Rima sheen dever ething
change<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.310> angles<00:01:13.700> on<00:01:13.880> stuff<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.590> you

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
change the angles on stuff and you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.830 
change the angles on stuff and you
probably<00:01:15.830> notice<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:16.910> this<00:01:17.360> part<00:01:17.690> is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
probably notice that this this part is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.190 
probably notice that this this part is
so<00:01:18.020> foolish<00:01:18.759> it's<00:01:19.759> boiling<00:01:20.030> over<00:01:20.390> coming<00:01:21.020> out

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200

and you can see it's it's plenty solid

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.830 
and you can see it's it's plenty solid
no<00:01:32.420> problem<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.289> this<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.619> 12<00:01:33.950> centimeter

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
that's all the water i'll ever won a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.400 
that's all the water i'll ever won a
boil<00:01:45.259> at<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.530> time<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.539> see<00:01:47.929> i<00:01:47.959> put<00:01:48.289> the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
you think and see if there's any more

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.370 
you think and see if there's any more
improvements<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:10.910> make<00:02:11.170> one<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
improvements I can make one of the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.110 
improvements I can make one of the
improvements<00:02:12.950> I'm<00:02:13.069> thinking<00:02:13.550> about<00:02:13.790> making

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
improvements I'm thinking about making

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.089 
improvements I'm thinking about making
is<00:02:14.450> changing<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.930> angle<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.410> these<00:02:15.560> legs<00:02:15.860> so

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
is changing the angle on these legs so

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.760 
is changing the angle on these legs so
it<00:02:16.130> stands<00:02:16.489> up<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.790> little<00:02:17.000> bit<00:02:17.120> higher<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
it stands up a little bit higher and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.559 
it stands up a little bit higher and
putting<00:02:18.770> up<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.220> dome<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.060> bottom<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
putting up a dome on the bottom and

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.390 
putting up a dome on the bottom and
putting<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.989> nipple<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.530> dome<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.250> it's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
putting the nipple in the dome so it's

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.570 
putting the nipple in the dome so it's
get<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.700> nipple<00:02:23.060> right<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.580> main

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
get the nipple right in out of the main

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.270 
get the nipple right in out of the main
diameter<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.300> pot<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.680> way<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.950> could

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
diameter the pot and that way you could

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.130 
diameter the pot and that way you could
probably<00:02:28.640> put<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.270> carry<00:02:29.540> case<00:02:29.660> because

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
probably put it in a carry case because

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.839 
probably put it in a carry case because
right<00:02:30.319> now<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.950> nipples<00:02:31.310> sticking<00:02:31.700> out<00:02:31.819> the

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
right now the nipples sticking out the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.640 
right now the nipples sticking out the
side<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.840> did<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.170> on<00:02:33.319> some<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
side and I did that on some of the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.280 
side and I did that on some of the
earlier<00:02:34.010> Voodoo's<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.790> know<00:02:34.910> let<00:02:35.120> me<00:02:35.290> let

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
earlier Voodoo's and you know let me let

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.630 
earlier Voodoo's and you know let me let
me<00:02:36.379> know<00:02:36.500> what<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.800> think<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.220> would<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.489> to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
me know what you think it would have to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.610 
me know what you think it would have to
be<00:02:37.670> probably<00:02:38.390> half<00:02:38.720> an<00:02:38.900> inch<00:02:39.050> higher<00:02:39.260> than<00:02:39.500> it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
be probably half an inch higher than it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.949 
be probably half an inch higher than it
is<00:02:39.770> now<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.640> would<00:02:40.760> really<00:02:41.030> protect<00:02:41.569> fuel

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
is now but it would really protect fuel

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.380 
is now but it would really protect fuel
line<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.370> get<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.730> nipple<00:02:44.030> out<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.270> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
line and get the nipple out of the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.240 
line and get the nipple out of the
diameter<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.129> uh<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:47.470> think<00:02:48.470> that's<00:02:48.920> everything

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
diameter so uh I think that's everything

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.490 
diameter so uh I think that's everything
I<00:02:49.519> wanted<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:49.969> say<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:50.599> video<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.019> did<00:02:51.290> want

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
so and you can see that the combo felled

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.399 
so and you can see that the combo felled
handle<00:02:56.790> works<00:02:57.790> quite<00:02:58.390> well<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:59.080> don't<00:02:59.260> get
