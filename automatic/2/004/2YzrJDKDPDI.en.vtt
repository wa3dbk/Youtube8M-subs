folk<00:00:09.269> occurs<00:00:09.750> well<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> believe<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.130> figured

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
folk occurs well I believe I figured

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.450 
folk occurs well I believe I figured
that<00:00:11.639> out<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:12.030> part<00:00:12.440> I<00:00:13.440> asked<00:00:13.920> myself<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.429> same

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
that out in part I asked myself the same

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.970 
that out in part I asked myself the same
question<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> ran<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> bunch<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> tests

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
question and so I ran a bunch of tests

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.529 
question and so I ran a bunch of tests
and<00:00:17.359> I<00:00:18.359> noticed<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.140> pattern<00:00:19.289> now<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.760> pattern

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I noticed a pattern now this pattern

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.900 
and I noticed a pattern now this pattern
this<00:00:22.050> method<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.680> I've<00:00:23.100> come<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
project what items you get from the

can tell that I was pressing the I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.010 
can tell that I was pressing the I

depressing the over key nothing was
popping<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.100> any<00:01:08.250> items

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
popping up so I don't have any items

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.730 
popping up so I don't have any items
always<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.939> illustrate<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> again<00:01:09.930> once<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
always to illustrate this again once I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
always to illustrate this again once I
have<00:01:10.890> items<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.460> show<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> mean<00:01:12.390> if

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have items to show what you mean if

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.530 
have items to show what you mean if
you're<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.780> familiar<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.290> screen<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
you're not familiar with this screen so

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
you're not familiar with this screen so
Umbreon<00:01:15.540> doesn't<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:16.770> items<00:01:17.659> unless

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Umbreon doesn't have any items unless

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.160 
Umbreon doesn't have any items unless
check<00:01:19.439> King<00:01:21.890> title<00:01:22.890> news<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.840> doesn't<00:01:25.049> have

check King title news it doesn't have

check King title news it doesn't have
any<00:01:25.290> items<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.710> all

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.859 

so<00:01:29.180> neither<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> holding<00:01:30.630> any<00:01:30.780> items<00:01:31.759> the

so neither is holding any items the

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.569 
so neither is holding any items the

the<00:02:46.739> Umbreon<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.519> have<00:02:47.910> actually<00:02:48.540> has<00:02:48.720> fewer

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
the Umbreon I have actually has fewer

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.839 
the Umbreon I have actually has fewer
steps<00:02:49.970> than<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:52.099> Kingdra<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.340> my

steps than the Kingdra of my
girlfriend's<00:02:54.360> pokewalker<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.720> I'll

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
girlfriend's pokewalker and so I'll

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.009 
girlfriend's pokewalker and so I'll

predict that the pokewalker holding the
Umbreon<00:03:01.410> will<00:03:01.680> actually<00:03:02.040> receive<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.459> tier<00:03:02.760> 9

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
Umbreon will actually receive the tier 9

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.660 
Umbreon will actually receive the tier 9
item<00:03:04.010> calcium<00:03:05.450> now<00:03:07.040> looking<00:03:08.040> back<00:03:08.190> at<00:03:08.370> dopey

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
item calcium now looking back at dopey

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.509 
item calcium now looking back at dopey
walkers<00:03:09.829> her<00:03:10.829> pokéwalker

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
walkers her pokéwalker

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.539 
walkers her pokéwalker
holding<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> Kendra<00:03:12.599> is<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.859> volcano

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
holding the Kendra is on the volcano

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.370 
holding the Kendra is on the volcano
path<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.680> she<00:03:16.680> has<00:03:16.920> how<00:03:17.579> many<00:03:17.639> steps<00:03:18.209> yeah

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
path and she has how many steps yeah

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.050 
path and she has how many steps yeah
forty<00:03:19.739> thousand<00:03:20.130> eight<00:03:20.250> hundred<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.790> she<00:03:20.850> has

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
forty thousand eight hundred so she has

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.000 
forty thousand eight hundred so she has
much<00:03:21.299> more<00:03:21.540> many<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.500> than<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.709> do

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
much more many more than I do

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.550 
much more many more than I do
so<00:03:23.609> her<00:03:24.450> pokéwalker<00:03:24.930> gets<00:03:25.200> preference<00:03:26.239> so

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
so her pokéwalker gets preference so

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.089 
so her pokéwalker gets preference so
going<00:03:28.560> back<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.519> Sarah<00:03:30.060> me<00:03:30.769> opening<00:03:31.769> up<00:03:31.889> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
going back to Sarah me opening up the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.330 
going back to Sarah me opening up the
other<00:03:34.190> page<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.579> open<00:03:36.380> for<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.620> volcano

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
other page I have open for the volcano

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.039 
other page I have open for the volcano
path<00:03:38.669> around<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:40.190> apricot<00:03:41.190> berry<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.599> 210

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
path around the apricot berry is the 210

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.690 
path around the apricot berry is the 210
item<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.590> also<00:03:43.829> requires<00:03:44.310> 8000<00:03:45.090> steps<00:03:45.269> so

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
item and it also requires 8000 steps so

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.550 
item and it also requires 8000 steps so
my<00:03:47.700> prediction<00:03:48.419> is<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.900> she'll<00:03:49.260> get<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
my prediction is that she'll get the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.909 
my prediction is that she'll get the
apricot<00:03:50.069> berry<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:51.540> will<00:03:51.900> get<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:54.419> calcium

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
apricot berry and I will get the calcium

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:18.970 
apricot berry and I will get the calcium
so<00:03:55.919> let's<00:03:56.910> see<00:03:57.060> what<00:03:57.180> happens

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.520 

calcium<00:04:19.970> abaca<00:04:21.490> and<00:04:23.020> exactly<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.350> predicted

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
calcium abaca and exactly as I predicted

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.110 
calcium abaca and exactly as I predicted
and<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.230> mentioned<00:04:27.590> earlier<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:28.190> can<00:04:28.880> see

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
and as I mentioned earlier you can see

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.870 
and as I mentioned earlier you can see
these<00:04:29.330> items<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.960> you've<00:04:30.080> obtained<00:04:30.880> it's

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
these items that you've obtained it's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.070 
these items that you've obtained it's
past<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:33.320> Pokemon<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.490> on<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.730> screen<00:04:35.080> if

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
past the Pokemon and I on the screen if

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.070 
past the Pokemon and I on the screen if
you<00:04:36.140> go<00:04:36.320> another<00:04:36.590> over<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.850> brings<00:04:38.090> up<00:04:38.300> items

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
you go another over it brings up items

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.960 
you go another over it brings up items
you<00:04:39.170> received<00:04:39.500> from<00:04:39.620> gifts<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.640> there's<00:04:40.850> the

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
you received from gifts and there's the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.130 
you received from gifts and there's the
calcium<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:46.010> there's<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.490> apricot<00:04:46.880> very

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
calcium and there's the apricot very

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
calcium and there's the apricot very
exactly<00:04:48.140> as<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.530> predicted<00:04:49.180> so<00:04:50.650> as<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.920> said

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
exactly as I predicted so as I said

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.940 
exactly as I predicted so as I said
earlier<00:04:52.700> this<00:04:53.300> method<00:04:53.660> only<00:04:54.020> works<00:04:54.380> if

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
earlier this method only works if

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.490 
earlier this method only works if
neither<00:04:55.730> pokewalker<00:04:56.480> is<00:04:56.840> holding<00:04:57.200> an<00:04:57.290> item

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
neither pokewalker is holding an item

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.650 
neither pokewalker is holding an item
from<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:58.010> previous<00:04:58.430> connection<00:04:59.120> of<00:04:59.240> this<00:04:59.390> sort

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
from a previous connection of this sort

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.450 
from a previous connection of this sort
