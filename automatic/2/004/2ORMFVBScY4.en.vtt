like the roots under root is the veins

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.550 
like the roots under root is the veins
of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> tree<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.329> does<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> help<00:01:46.049> make<00:01:46.319> sure

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
of the tree so does this help make sure

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.349 
of the tree so does this help make sure
like<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.069> it's<00:01:47.189> kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.399> vitamins<00:01:47.969> this

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
like is it's kind of like vitamins this

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.589

is<00:01:48.569> a<00:01:48.600> vitamin<00:01:49.530> rich<00:01:49.799> nutrient<00:01:50.670> rich<00:01:50.819> all

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
is a vitamin rich nutrient rich all

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.380 
is a vitamin rich nutrient rich all
natural<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> tree<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.399> absorb<00:01:54.209> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
natural so the tree is gonna absorb it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.419 
natural so the tree is gonna absorb it
and<00:01:54.479> use<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.649> mother<00:01:55.950> nature<00:01:56.250> put

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
and use it just as if mother nature put

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.279 
and use it just as if mother nature put
it<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> ground<00:01:56.880> herself<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.959> about

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
it on the ground herself so you're about

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.229 
it on the ground herself so you're about
to<00:01:58.439> move<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.039> tree<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.729> we're<00:02:00.030> gonna

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
to move this tree then right we're gonna

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.240 
to move this tree then right we're gonna
move<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.630> true<00:02:00.869> yes<00:02:01.079> sir<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.069> do

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you want to be about a foot off the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
you want to be about a foot off the
trunk<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> tree<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.979> pour<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> all<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
trunk of the tree and pour it all the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.330 
trunk of the tree and pour it all the
way<00:02:12.209> around<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:13.890> do<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.099> just<00:02:14.250> like

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
way around and I just do it just like

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.180 
way around and I just do it just like
this<00:02:14.549> yes<00:02:14.970> sir

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
this yes sir

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.090 
this yes sir
a<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.970> good<00:02:17.150> technique<00:02:17.710> prior<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.860> digging

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
a really good technique prior to digging

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.800 
a really good technique prior to digging
the<00:02:19.580> root<00:02:19.820> ball<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.270> trees<00:02:20.540> should<00:02:20.750> be

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
the root ball of the trees should be

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.570 
the root ball of the trees should be
watered<00:02:21.260> thoroughly<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.100> keep<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> ball

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
watered thoroughly to keep the ball

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.000 
watered thoroughly to keep the ball
intact<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.450> reduce<00:02:23.690> as<00:02:23.870> much<00:02:23.900> soil<00:02:24.500> loss<00:02:24.740> as

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
intact and reduce as much soil loss as

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
intact and reduce as much soil loss as
possible<00:02:25.610> during<00:02:25.760> transport<00:02:26.450> this

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
possible during transport this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.810 
possible during transport this
particular<00:02:27.200> tree<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.680> being<00:02:28.040> uprooted<00:02:28.520> and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
particular tree is being uprooted and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.400 
particular tree is being uprooted and
moved<00:02:28.880> because<00:02:29.690> it's<00:02:29.870> right<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.380> middle

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
moved because it's right in the middle

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.350 
moved because it's right in the middle
of<00:02:30.770> where<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> new<00:02:31.220> home<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.120> built

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
of where a new home is going to be built

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510 
of where a new home is going to be built
basically<00:02:32.960> it<00:02:33.080> is<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.860> vitamins

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
basically it is just like the vitamins

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.710 
basically it is just like the vitamins
you<00:02:34.610> might<00:02:34.820> take<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.270> morning

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
you might take in the morning

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.510 
you might take in the morning
really

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
really

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.840 
really
vitamins<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.420> take<00:02:38.630> don't<00:02:38.840> smell<00:02:39.080> as<00:02:39.290> bad<00:02:39.320> as

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
vitamins I take don't smell as bad as

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.870 
vitamins I take don't smell as bad as
that<00:02:40.850> does<00:02:41.090> right<00:02:41.300> there<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.250> what's<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.670> next

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
that does right there so what's the next

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.210 
that does right there so what's the next
step<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.270> process<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.960> would<00:02:45.080> do

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
step of the process that we would do

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.470 
step of the process that we would do
well<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:46.400> gotta<00:02:46.580> have<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> place<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:46.970> put<00:02:47.270> this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
well we gotta have a place to put this

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.570 
well we gotta have a place to put this
tree<00:02:47.780> when<00:02:48.050> we<00:02:48.200> do<00:02:48.350> dig<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.710> right<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> next

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
tree when we do dig it right so the next

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.220 
tree when we do dig it right so the next
step<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:49.940> gonna<00:02:50.060> be<00:02:50.180> creating<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.050> hole

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
step is gonna be creating the hole

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.770 
step is gonna be creating the hole
digging<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.040> hole<00:02:52.190> digging<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.700> hole<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.630> that

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
digging a hole digging a hole is that

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.000 
digging a hole digging a hole is that
what<00:02:53.870> we're<00:02:53.960> gonna<00:02:54.050> go<00:02:54.230> do<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.680> we're<00:02:54.890> gonna

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
what we're gonna go do and we're gonna

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.980 
what we're gonna go do and we're gonna
go<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.460> let's<00:02:56.180> go<00:02:56.270> dig<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.450> hole<00:02:56.630> let's<00:02:56.870> do

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
go do that let's go dig a hole let's do

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.320 
go do that let's go dig a hole let's do
that<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.770> reason<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.430> plywood<00:03:01.820> is

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
that the reason for all this plywood is

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.200 
that the reason for all this plywood is
the<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.590> soil<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.100> too<00:03:04.280> soft<00:03:04.610> it's<00:03:04.910> muddy

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
the the soil is too soft it's muddy

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.060 
the the soil is too soft it's muddy
especially<00:03:05.720> out<00:03:05.810> here<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:06.050> Texas<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:06.620> what

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
especially out here in Texas so what

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.890 
especially out here in Texas so what
they're<00:03:07.220> doing<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.490> called<00:03:07.700> decking<00:03:08.150> putting

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
they're doing is called decking putting

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.200 
they're doing is called decking putting
the<00:03:08.990> plywood<00:03:09.410> down<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:10.670> give<00:03:10.820> enough<00:03:11.030> hard

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
the plywood down to give enough hard

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.260 
the plywood down to give enough hard
traction<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.080> truck<00:03:12.320> could<00:03:12.470> back<00:03:12.620> up

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
traction so that the truck could back up

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.300 
traction so that the truck could back up
we're<00:03:14.270> gonna<00:03:14.360> dig<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.600> hole<00:03:15.070> bring<00:03:16.070> her<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.340> boys

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
we're gonna dig a hole bring her in boys

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.650 
we're gonna dig a hole bring her in boys
root<00:03:19.310> ball<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.760> tree<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.150> we're<00:03:20.300> about<00:03:20.480> to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
root ball the tree that we're about to

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.910 
root ball the tree that we're about to
transport<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.820> 125<00:03:22.820> inches<00:03:23.240> across<00:03:23.570> 32<00:03:24.530> feet

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
transport is 125 inches across 32 feet

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.090 
transport is 125 inches across 32 feet
around<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.520> 7<00:03:26.330> feet<00:03:26.540> 9<00:03:26.810> inches<00:03:26.840> deep<00:03:27.410> that

means we're gonna have to dig an

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.540 
means we're gonna have to dig an
eight-foot<00:03:29.450> hole<00:03:29.690> before<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.770> man<00:03:31.250> Ted
