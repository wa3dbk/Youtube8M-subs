00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
talk about destruction everything from

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.309 
talk about destruction everything from
buildings<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.630> vehicles<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:06.009> trees<00:02:06.670> and

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
buildings to vehicles to trees and

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.499 
buildings to vehicles to trees and
actual<00:02:08.319> ground<00:02:08.530> you're<00:02:09.039> walking<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:10.119> can

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
actual ground you're walking on it can

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.530 
actual ground you're walking on it can

so<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.659> order<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.230> work<00:02:21.440> properly

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so in order for this to work properly

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.720 
so in order for this to work properly
the<00:02:22.849> lighting<00:02:23.269> needs<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.569> be<00:02:23.690> dynamic<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.349> well

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the lighting needs to be dynamic as well

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.500 
the lighting needs to be dynamic as well
if<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.940> blow<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> hole<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.659> wall<00:02:26.690> or<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:32.390> I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
if I blow a hole in a wall or if I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.240 
if I blow a hole in a wall or if I
change<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.200> position<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.769> Sun<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
change the position of the Sun the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.960 
change the position of the Sun the
shadows<00:02:34.909> will<00:02:35.420> change<00:02:35.690> along<00:02:35.959> with<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.790> all

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
shadows will change along with it so all

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.180 
shadows will change along with it so all
of<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.329> adds<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.019> unique<00:02:39.500> battlefield

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
of this adds to a unique battlefield

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.759 
of this adds to a unique battlefield

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
sounds happening at the same time that

sounds happening at the same time that
he<00:03:00.709> didn't<00:03:00.980> work<00:03:01.480> what<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.900> didn't<00:03:03.799> work<00:03:04.040> yeah

but<00:03:05.420> we<00:03:05.540> fixed<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:06.079> with<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.129> Frostbite

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
but we fixed that with the Frostbite

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.640 
but we fixed that with the Frostbite
high<00:03:08.120> dynamic<00:03:08.299> range<00:03:08.659> audio<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.530> have

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
high dynamic range audio we have

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.410 
high dynamic range audio we have
introduced<00:03:10.159> way<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.519> automatically

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
introduced way to automatically

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.500 
introduced way to automatically
prioritize<00:03:12.170> sound<00:03:12.739> sources<00:03:13.069> at<00:03:13.340> runtime<00:03:13.700> so

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
prioritize sound sources at runtime so

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.000 
prioritize sound sources at runtime so
let's<00:03:14.750> take<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> look<00:03:15.140> at<00:03:15.230> an<00:03:15.349> example<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
let's take a look at an example and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.520 
let's take a look at an example and
listen<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.760> how<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.000> music<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.930> radio<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
listen to how the music of the radio and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:28.599 
listen to how the music of the radio and
the<00:03:18.739> explosions<00:03:19.280> interact<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:28.160> when<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.519> were

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
the explosions interact so when you were

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.129 
the explosions interact so when you were
getting<00:03:28.760> shot<00:03:29.120> at<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:29.569> don't<00:03:29.750> really<00:03:29.870> care

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
getting shot at you don't really care

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.599 
getting shot at you don't really care

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
about the radio of the car playing

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.449 
about the radio of the car playing

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459
