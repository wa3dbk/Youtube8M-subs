00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.529
 Hello everyone and fondón and we are in a 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:05.330
 new gameplay was in a duel for 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.700
 rapidite teams in summit to bring 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.719
 the funds section recommends like me 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.509
 I think it's going to be every Monday 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.879
 very long weeks with good addition 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.130
 the cold starts to feel like watching movies 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.080
 things new series and how it expresses what 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.640
 win as it is thought to enter the top 5 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.770
 of vampire movies the week that 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.330
 comes to bring the top 5 top 10 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.370
 scary movies maybe these three do not 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.720
 I know so please, if you had any 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.820
 idea I recommend that you see them 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.100
 quickie if you can also include them if 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.390
 you see some movie like this modern 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.130
 you have seen that it is really good 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.930
 for me feedback please me 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.670
 I will leave a comment 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.090
 and good starting with the top 5 what 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.680
 first say it's my top 5 of things 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.780
 that I like me and that I can 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.160
 recommend to you logically there are 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.630
 some that should be for some 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.510
 motives above or etcetera etcetera 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.760
 but good is my opinion and good 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.559
 starting number 5 no doubt for me and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 young people hidden because good is a 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 strange little movie 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.350
 It is not a movie, much less 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.629
 it's very funny and I put it in the top 5 and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.369
 I put it in important movies because 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 It is the first film in which 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 vampires let's say they do not repent 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.250
 his way of being that is it for if 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.479
 it's kill people want blood and not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.270
 there is no problem of them even being 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 they have fun doing it and they are not a burden 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 say that say that often 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.490
 has treated the vampire as a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.829
 curse to them it is not 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.229
 a very rocky aesthetic with rock music 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.270
 in very funny moments like people 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.280
 killing vampires with water pistols 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.080
 holy water if you have not seen it 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.659
 you have to see them because it's a before and 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.180
 a later in the vampire genre 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.710
 and I highly recommend them in these 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.560
 five because it's not a great movie but 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.770
 if you marked a before and after the number 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.539
 four the truth that I have to put it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.590
 it's open until dawn is another 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.530
 which is a pretty movie 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 strange very good very good actor 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.090
 Main is George Clooney but hey 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.549
 is very young, practically from the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.649
 first movies maybe he did and the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.240
 I recommend because good can happen 50 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.799
 minutes of the movie and still has not 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 no vampire and the movie appeared 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.930
 It is about vampires is about them 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.970
 a and etc. and head of the band that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.160
 they do a robbery kidnap a family 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.180
 they go to mexico trying to escape and 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.670
 at the end then good 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.900
 they have to enter a bar and so on and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.850
 Barca suddenly began to 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.290
 turn everyone into vampires and good happens 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.710
 what happens the typical shots by all 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.930
 sides etc. 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.280
 but it's very surprising that so much happened 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.990
 of film and nothing appears 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.610
 vampires or even if you do not know that 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.740
 Vampires are not going to wait for you 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.560
 suddenly it is in plan but this to which 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.060
 comes this suddenly very recommended is 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.650
 a classic also has a game of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.290
 computer if someone does not know it then 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 he had it and it's not bad in the truth 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 that good long time and it shows that it is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 old but but it's pretty good and 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.010
 I put it in these four because good 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.410
 It is also something surprising and a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.750
 movie that you have to see without a doubt top 3 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.600
 that could be the first one could be the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.170
 number one the nosferatu movie is 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.640
 my let's say my chemo the classic cinema 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.750
 100% recommended a perfect performance 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.130
 of this drácula is impressive you have 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.450
 that seeing it is black and white I know it is 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.800
 old why maybe he has not put 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.080
 higher because I understand that at 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.060
 we are not interested in classical cinema nor 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.070
 the cinema in black and white then 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.600
 I do not want to put it in number 1 either 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.430
 how good a lot of time has gone and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.500
 although they are film times go 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.480
 happening and there are movies that stick very 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.460
 Strong to include that I like more 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.260
 for example then I leave it there and if 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.760
 someone wants to see it because then there is 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.530
 my recommendation that if you can 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.930
 see it and that is a movie 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.370
 next we start already with the second 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.130
 for me the most important of the top 3 is 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.990
 the one of drácula of bram stoker flips me 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.190
 those vesicles well in a book is 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.260
 amazing 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.970
 anthony hopkins appears around also 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.900
 what am I going to say about this actor who is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.450
 Awesome 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.090
 so if you really have a chance 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.640
 please see it for me it can be the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.319
 better the better one we say 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.420
 in the classical branch of what comes to be 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.150
 dracula festival here think 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.340
 second chance pipe o pipe oo 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.709
 let's say that of the classic festival of 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.930
 Dracula's classic genre has seen how 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.000
 He lives in his castle, what happens 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.459
 cetera etcetera is the best to me 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.039
 love it appears on all topics 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.650
 of dracula all winks those of the 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.959
 twins etc etc everything is to say 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.389
 see it please if you have not seen it 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.400
 is cut in blood or anything by the 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.710
 style all the clichés of 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.410
 drácula then very very good 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.180
 they 're not old and what's said a hundred 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.120
 one hundred recommended and for me the best 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.400
 movie is because it's good for me 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.320
 favorite movie of all genres 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.419
 in the interview with a vampire is a 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.220
 pretty modern movie they have very 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.289
 good actors this tom cruise brad pitt 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.020
 and antonio flags you already have pulling 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.820
 also for the national thing I can not say 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.620
 that yes it is the best in the world but 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.670
 I personally like to go through 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.490
 all times practically 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.900
 of Europe and part of the USA then by 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.640
 I recommend that 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.500
 I hope you liked it I'll let you down 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.270
 all the names of the movies we 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.270
 we see the next week to another next
