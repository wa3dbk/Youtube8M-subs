Phyllis's 2 keyboard but perhaps the

Phyllis's 2 keyboard but perhaps the
thing<00:01:32.560> that's<00:01:32.770> most<00:01:33.040> remarkable<00:01:33.729> about<00:01:33.939> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
thing that's most remarkable about the

very fast and capable machine despite
the<00:01:38.770> fact<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.310> has<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.729> integrated
