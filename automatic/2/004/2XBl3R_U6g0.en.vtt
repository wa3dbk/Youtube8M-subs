this
I<00:02:15.350> don't<00:02:16.350> really<00:02:17.070> know<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.820> can<00:02:18.030> see<00:02:18.390> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.979 
I don't really know if you can see it
but<00:02:20.300> I'm<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.720> repeat<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.470> more<00:02:22.590> time<00:02:23.989> so

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
but I'm going to repeat one more time so

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.350 
but I'm going to repeat one more time so
you<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.489> see<00:02:26.489> what<00:02:26.670> I'm<00:02:26.760> doing

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you can see what I'm doing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.670 
you can see what I'm doing
I<00:02:27.390> hope<00:02:28.320> better<00:02:32.030> so

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.960 

first<00:02:36.680> it's<00:02:37.099> important<00:02:37.700> first<00:02:37.939> to<00:02:38.239> flip<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.959> up

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
first it's important first to flip it up

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.780 
first it's important first to flip it up
because<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.150> gives<00:02:41.420> more<00:02:41.720> volume<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:43.310> your

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
because it gives more volume in your

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.890 
because it gives more volume in your
hair<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:45.500> down<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:47.269> then<00:02:49.150> down<00:02:52.900> you'll

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
hair and then down and then down you'll

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.559 
hair and then down and then down you'll
see<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.650> very<00:02:54.799> easy<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.519> do<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:58.569> know

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
see it's very easy to do this so I know

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.920 
see it's very easy to do this so I know
it<00:02:59.810> maybe<00:02:59.989> looks<00:03:00.290> hard<00:03:00.680> now<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.569> you'll<00:03:02.569> see

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it maybe looks hard now but you'll see

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:43.360 
it maybe looks hard now but you'll see
it

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:54.080 

and<00:03:44.629> now<00:03:45.629> when<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.230> get<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> top<00:03:47.040> part<00:03:52.790> what<00:03:53.790> you

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
and now when you get a top part what you

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:04.680 
and now when you get a top part what you
want<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.750> do

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.970 

you<00:04:05.690> want<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:08.380> first<00:04:09.380> go<00:04:10.010> down<00:04:11.050> Dan<00:04:12.050> up<00:04:12.350> because

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.270 
you want to first go down Dan up because
that<00:04:13.340> will<00:04:13.580> make<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:14.180> bigger<00:04:14.990> volume<00:04:15.350> so

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
that will make a bigger volume so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.990 
that will make a bigger volume so
instead<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.329> going<00:04:17.600> up<00:04:18.070> we're<00:04:19.070> going<00:04:19.340> down<00:04:19.700> I

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
instead of going up we're going down I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.330 
instead of going up we're going down I
hope<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.230> understand<00:04:21.739> what<00:04:22.190> I'm
