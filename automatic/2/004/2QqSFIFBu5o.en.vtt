00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.170
 worth more mord representation of me 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.050
 I see today and who sees it is 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 lord of the rings mod namely an armor 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.840
 of which an armor from the pressure of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.770
 the big thing isengart 's 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.850
 looks a bit weird now with me 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.140
 whole thing because I'm human 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.099
 I would be the place or afraid of it 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 more support 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.460
 yes, and indeed there are not any more 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.649
 parts of the mat belongs by the way 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 not there is also a moment 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.750
 there is a shield so the helm 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 normal home times the normal ones 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.879
 centurio and the berserk I have 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.980
 Here, too, I believe somewhere exactly 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.739
 there is the versatel and the centers 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.340
 already on and the other 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 I think he looks best from the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.520
 standard helmet the shield also looks very 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.369
 good and a sword is there 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.460
 of course, too 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.270
 more exactly two you the versa here 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 and then there is the normal one 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.280
 complicates what you know 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.680
 guttenberg can also be seen in the film 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.680
 but not quite as present as this 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.650
 I show that now again briefly without 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.650
 coat 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.700
 there 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 yes that's the fashion 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.180
 oh so now I have the poor ones 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.229
 the gloves on those do not belong 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.800
 Now I'm still waiting to show you how to do that 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.540
 forge of the mottos unfortunately in English 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.780
 but that does not bother me at all 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.500
 but there are some 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.729
 I do not know if you are a little if 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.080
 Get a little involved with the creation kit 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.300
 familiar then it should not 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.410
 its easy to translate 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.410
 there are still a few words 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:23.380
 so it is played under the basket day 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.720
 by a small lake that yes in the category 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.490
 rock armor will be forged but 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.850
 Nevertheless, almost all things exist only 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.210
 leave here and leather here, for example 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.890
 three strips of leather 69 one 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.200
 leather stripes three iron brook and yes me 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.820
 I'll just go through this one 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.410
 that's the whole thing right here 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.240
 sees the inventory textual plus 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.530
 strange, but that's still it 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.570
 normal the normal direction I 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.920
 now also from the normal helmet 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.360
 shield and the sword are the things 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.840
 middle excessively he had just 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.790
 seen 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 I'm relatively well not own 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.360
 that's why the unanimous ones are later or 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.670
 of course that's one heartfelt late yet 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.990
 a bit stronger than normal though 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.650
 he somehow has a bad character 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:18.730
 plays yes I hope you liked it 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.060
 and then I would say until the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.060
 next time 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.450
 Yes 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.450
 which still need to be now 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.750
 bye
