what is up guys Kyle here back with
another<00:00:02.490> video<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.149> today<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:04.230> are<00:00:04.920> taking<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
another video and today we are taking a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.990 
another video and today we are taking a
look<00:00:05.460> at<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.060> retractor<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.200> X<00:00:07.440> s<00:00:08.000> scuba

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
look at the retractor from X s scuba

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.459 
look at the retractor from X s scuba
this<00:00:09.780> thing<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.320> pretty<00:00:10.920> cool<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.469> basically

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
this thing is pretty cool so basically

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.369 
this thing is pretty cool so basically
on<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.040> surface<00:00:14.460> its<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.940> retractable<00:00:15.750> pull

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
on the surface its a retractable pull

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.620 
on the surface its a retractable pull
cord<00:00:16.740> think<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.100> those<00:00:17.250> things<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.880> people

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
cord think of those things that people

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.750 
cord think of those things that people
have<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.199> offices<00:00:19.740> where<00:00:20.039> they<00:00:20.070> keep<00:00:20.550> that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
have in offices where they keep that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340 
have in offices where they keep that
card<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.270> their<00:00:21.420> belt<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.230> tiny

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
card on their belt with a little tiny

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
card on their belt with a little tiny
retractor<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.070> need<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> use<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.420> card

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
retractor and they need to use the card

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.420 
retractor and they need to use the card
they<00:00:24.840> pull<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:25.680> hit<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.070> against

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
they pull it out and they hit it against

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609 
they pull it out and they hit it against
the<00:00:26.609> whatever<00:00:27.390> needs<00:00:27.810> their<00:00:28.080> card<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.470> then

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the whatever needs their card and then

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
the whatever needs their card and then
it<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.949> let<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.189> go<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.609> sits<00:00:29.849> back<00:00:30.060> on

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
it they let it go and it sits back on

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.780 
it they let it go and it sits back on
their<00:00:30.420> waist<00:00:30.630> well<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.520> for

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
their waist well think of that but for

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
their waist well think of that but for
your<00:00:32.940> GoPro<00:00:33.300> camera<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> retractor<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
your GoPro camera so the retractor is a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.549 
your GoPro camera so the retractor is a
lot<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:35.940> heavy<00:00:36.180> duty<00:00:36.239> heavy<00:00:37.079> duty<00:00:37.290> enough<00:00:37.469> in

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
lot more heavy duty heavy duty enough in

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.240 
lot more heavy duty heavy duty enough in
fact<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.000> retract<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.090> camera<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:40.250> while

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
fact to retract your camera from while

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.709 
fact to retract your camera from while
hanging<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.940> basically<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> keep<00:00:42.600> your

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
hanging so basically you can keep your

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.389 
hanging so basically you can keep your
camera<00:00:42.989> anywhere<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> want<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.219> just

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
camera anywhere you want and then just

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.540 
camera anywhere you want and then just
let<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> it'll<00:00:45.180> jump<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
let it go and it'll jump back up to

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
let it go and it'll jump back up to
wherever<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.760> being<00:00:47.850> stored<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> that's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
wherever it's being stored and that's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.680 
wherever it's being stored and that's
kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> high<00:00:51.030> points<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.510> what

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
kind of all the high points that's what

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
kind of all the high points that's what
it<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.199> designed<00:00:52.890> by<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> scuba<00:00:53.579> diving

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it is it's designed by a scuba diving

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
it is it's designed by a scuba diving
company<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.570> designed<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.110> used

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
company so it's designed to be used

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
company so it's designed to be used
underwater<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.420> its<00:00:57.420> engineered<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
underwater and its engineered for that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.080 
underwater and its engineered for that
so<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.739> idea<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.129> would<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.789> clip

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so the idea here would be that you clip

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.500 
so the idea here would be that you clip
this<00:01:00.590> little<00:01:01.590> clip<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.100> BCD<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.789> then

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this little clip to your BCD and then

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
this little clip to your BCD and then
your<00:01:03.690> GoPro<00:01:04.110> camera<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.739> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> sit

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
your GoPro camera would just kind of sit

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
your GoPro camera would just kind of sit
on<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.670> side<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
on your side just kind of like this and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
on your side just kind of like this and
then<00:01:07.500> whenever<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> needed<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.970> would

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
then whenever you needed it you would

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.240 
then whenever you needed it you would
just<00:01:09.299> grab<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
just grab it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
just grab it
unwind<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.479> shoot<00:01:13.080> whatever<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
unwind it go and shoot whatever you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
unwind it go and shoot whatever you
needed<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.369> 32<00:01:15.270> inch<00:01:15.680> retractable<00:01:17.240> spectra

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
needed the 32 inch retractable spectra

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.460 
needed the 32 inch retractable spectra
and<00:01:18.619> nylon<00:01:19.619> horde<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.080> enough<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.350> allow

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and nylon horde here is enough to allow

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.999 
and nylon horde here is enough to allow
you<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.210> basically<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> pretty<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:25.560> arm's

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you to basically get a pretty good arm's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
you to basically get a pretty good arm's
reach<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> end<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.170> arm

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
reach to basically the end of your arm

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
reach to basically the end of your arm
and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.820> you're<00:01:29.939> done<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.180> your

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and then when you're done with your

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
and then when you're done with your
camera<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.290> let<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
camera you would just let it go and it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.580 
camera you would just let it go and it
would<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> sit<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.560> your

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
would go back and sit back on your

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.870 
would go back and sit back on your
shoulder<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.159> underneath<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
shoulder right underneath where have you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630 
shoulder right underneath where have you
clipped<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.270> too<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.490> you'd<00:01:38.490> never

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
clipped this too and then you'd never

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.830 
clipped this too and then you'd never
have<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> worry<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.090> losing<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> other

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
have to worry about losing it the other

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.870 
have to worry about losing it the other
place<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.189> handy<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> one

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
place this can be really handy and one

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
place this can be really handy and one
of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> places<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.810> suggest<00:01:43.320> using<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of the places that they suggest using it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
of the places that they suggest using it
is<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.100> some<00:01:44.250> sports<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.759> skydiving<00:01:45.000> or

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
anywhere where you really want access to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.310 
anywhere where you really want access to
your<00:01:48.479> camera<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:51.110> don't<00:01:52.110> want

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
your camera but then you also don't want

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.990 
your camera but then you also don't want
to<00:01:52.380> ever<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> lose<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.490> drop<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to ever have to lose it or drop it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
to ever have to lose it or drop it
personally<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.170> thinking<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.619> something

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
personally I was thinking for something

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.240 
personally I was thinking for something
like<00:01:56.009> skiing<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:57.710> sailing<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.829> could<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.159> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
like skiing or sailing I could see this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.819 
like skiing or sailing I could see this
being<00:01:59.399> incredibly<00:02:00.060> useful<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:01.140> might

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
being incredibly useful because I might

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
being incredibly useful because I might
want<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.219> access<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:02.969> GoPro<00:02:03.270> camera

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
want to have access to my GoPro camera

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.789 
want to have access to my GoPro camera
but<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.990> also<00:02:04.140> might<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.619> able<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but then I also might want to be able to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.190 
but then I also might want to be able to
go<00:02:05.009> back<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.549> finish<00:02:06.240> doing<00:02:06.570> whatever<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.049> was

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
go back and finish doing whatever I was

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.749 
go back and finish doing whatever I was
doing<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.649> back<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> finish<00:02:08.129> skiing<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.459> run

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
doing go back to finish skiing my run

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.910 
doing go back to finish skiing my run
and<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.440> worry<00:02:10.679> about

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and just not have to really worry about

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.699 
and just not have to really worry about
it<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.580> thing<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.209> sports<00:02:12.870> which<00:02:13.050> are<00:02:13.200> not

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
it one thing for sports which are not

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.130 
it one thing for sports which are not
diving<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.480> still<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> pretty

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
diving is that this is still a pretty

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.360 
diving is that this is still a pretty
long<00:02:16.500> cord<00:02:17.459> here<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:19.189> tight<00:02:20.189> enough

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
long cord here and it's not tight enough

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.140 
long cord here and it's not tight enough
up<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.939> to<00:02:21.150> keep<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.629> up<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.920> you're<00:02:23.879> going

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
up there to keep it up if you're going

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.789 
up there to keep it up if you're going
over<00:02:24.390> jumps<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:24.989> you're<00:02:25.110> gonna<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.409> skiing

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
over jumps so if you're gonna go skiing

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:26.839 
over jumps so if you're gonna go skiing
with<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.250> you're<00:02:26.340> gonna<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.640> over<00:02:26.819> a

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
with this and you're gonna go over a

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.720 
with this and you're gonna go over a
jump<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:28.230> might<00:02:28.680> drop<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.519> it'll

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
jump it might drop out and it'll

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.300 
jump it might drop out and it'll
definitely<00:02:30.090> bang<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.739> forth<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.159> your

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
definitely bang back and forth on your

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.569 
definitely bang back and forth on your
chest<00:02:32.609> so<00:02:33.590> well<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> retractors<00:02:35.129> really<00:02:35.340> cool

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
chest so well the retractors really cool

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.750 
chest so well the retractors really cool
and<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.209> keep<00:02:36.420> stuff<00:02:36.680> held<00:02:37.680> somewhere<00:02:38.519> you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
and it can keep stuff held somewhere you

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.119 
and it can keep stuff held somewhere you
can<00:02:38.879> see<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:40.049> retract<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.829> but<00:02:40.980> once

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
can see that I can retract it but once

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.860 
can see that I can retract it but once
it<00:02:41.220> gets<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.519> end<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.150> didn't<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.599> come

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
it gets the end if it didn't have come

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.979 
it gets the end if it didn't have come
up<00:02:42.989> with<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.170> lot<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.379> speed<00:02:43.829> it<00:02:44.280> will<00:02:44.989> possibly

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
up with a lot of speed it will possibly

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.170 
up with a lot of speed it will possibly
not<00:02:46.290> make<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> all<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.889> way<00:02:47.069> up<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.760> same<00:02:48.000> kind

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
not make it all the way up the same kind

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.819 
not make it all the way up the same kind
of<00:02:48.209> thing<00:02:48.389> is<00:02:48.510> if<00:02:48.629> you<00:02:48.720> go<00:02:48.870> over<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.079> jump<00:02:49.409> it'll

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
of thing is if you go over a jump it'll

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.129 
of thing is if you go over a jump it'll
go<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.579> then<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.180> won't<00:02:51.420> quite<00:02:51.659> retract

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
go down and then it won't quite retract

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.289 
go down and then it won't quite retract
on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.349> way<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:53.489> sports<00:02:53.879> like<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
on the way up so for sports like that

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.759 
on the way up so for sports like that
well<00:02:54.599> it's<00:02:54.780> great<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.379> can<00:02:55.470> pull<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
well it's great because you can pull it

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.379 
well it's great because you can pull it
out<00:02:55.889> take<00:02:56.190> your<00:02:56.370> stuff<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.760> let<00:02:56.909> it<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.180> I

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
out take your stuff and let it go I

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.490 
out take your stuff and let it go I
would<00:02:57.900> recommend<00:02:58.319> using<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.129> kind<00:02:59.609> of<00:03:00.500> not

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
would recommend using it and kind of not

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.009 
would recommend using it and kind of not
fully<00:03:02.040> relying<00:03:02.609> on<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.180> probably<00:03:03.510> having

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
fully relying on it and probably having

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.539 
fully relying on it and probably having
it<00:03:04.260> once<00:03:04.439> it<00:03:04.560> retract<00:03:04.829> sup<00:03:05.069> having<00:03:05.370> something

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
it once it retract sup having something

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.920 
it once it retract sup having something
to<00:03:05.700> tuck<00:03:05.939> it<00:03:06.090> under<00:03:06.359> like<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.689> you're<00:03:06.780> skiing

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
to tuck it under like if you're skiing

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.899 
to tuck it under like if you're skiing
with<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.170> backpack<00:03:07.470> you'd<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:08.579> clip<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
with a backpack you'd have this clip to

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.339 
with a backpack you'd have this clip to
the<00:03:09.000> backpack<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.510> then<00:03:09.599> maybe<00:03:09.780> tuck<00:03:10.139> this

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
the backpack and then maybe tuck this

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.530 
the backpack and then maybe tuck this
underneath<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.040> backpack<00:03:11.519> strap<00:03:11.849> just

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
underneath the backpack strap just

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.940 
underneath the backpack strap just
because<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.230> don't<00:03:13.470> really<00:03:13.620> want<00:03:13.859> it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
because you don't really want it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.580 
because you don't really want it
bouncing<00:03:14.340> around<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.819> also<00:03:15.689> my<00:03:16.139> second

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
bouncing around and also my second

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.280 
bouncing around and also my second
complaint<00:03:16.859> about<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.549> how<00:03:17.930> big<00:03:18.930> this

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
complaint about this is how big this

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.589 
complaint about this is how big this
whole<00:03:19.560> thing<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.370> GoPro<00:03:20.970> attachment

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
whole thing is so the GoPro attachment

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.530 
whole thing is so the GoPro attachment
you<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.079> see<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.650> very<00:03:23.549> long<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:23.849> that's<00:03:24.329> done

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
you can see is very long and that's done

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.280 
you can see is very long and that's done
for<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> reason

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
for a reason

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.140 
for a reason
that's<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.650> handle<00:03:26.129> so<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.639> see<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.879> once<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
that's a handle so you can see it once I

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.409 
that's a handle so you can see it once I
extend<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.410> turns<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.430> handle<00:03:30.299> and

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
extend it it turns in to a handle and

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.849 
extend it it turns in to a handle and
it's<00:03:30.569> really<00:03:30.870> great<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.109> shoot<00:03:31.409> with<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.560> love<00:03:31.829> a

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
it's really great to shoot with I love a

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.349 
it's really great to shoot with I love a
little<00:03:32.040> handle<00:03:32.400> like<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:32.909> it<00:03:33.000> makes<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
little handle like this and it makes it

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.089 
little handle like this and it makes it
way<00:03:33.930> used<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.199> get<00:03:34.319> steady<00:03:34.500> shot<00:03:34.739> keeps<00:03:35.010> my

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
way used to get steady shot keeps my

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.699 
way used to get steady shot keeps my
hand<00:03:35.280> off<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.519> camera<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:35.909> that's<00:03:36.299> great<00:03:36.810> but

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
hand off the camera and that's great but

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.420 
hand off the camera and that's great but
then<00:03:37.949> that<00:03:38.639> also<00:03:38.790> adds<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.269> lot<00:03:39.599> of<00:03:40.099> stuff<00:03:41.099> here

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
then that also adds a lot of stuff here

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.610 
then that also adds a lot of stuff here
and<00:03:41.579> by<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.760> time<00:03:42.030> we're<00:03:42.209> done<00:03:42.440> we've<00:03:43.440> got<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and by the time we're done we've got a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.250 
and by the time we're done we've got a
mount<00:03:43.919> which<00:03:44.129> is<00:03:44.159> probably<00:03:44.879> well<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.750> over

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
mount which is probably well it is over

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.379 
mount which is probably well it is over
a<00:03:46.290> foot<00:03:46.949> along<00:03:47.609> from<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.879> end<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.120> camera

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
a foot along from the end of the camera

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.360 
a foot along from the end of the camera
to<00:03:48.479> the<00:03:48.569> end<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.900> clip<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.319> that's<00:03:49.979> a<00:03:50.190> lot

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
to the end of the clip and that's a lot

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.729 
to the end of the clip and that's a lot
to<00:03:50.549> be<00:03:50.579> swinging<00:03:50.909> around<00:03:51.389> even<00:03:52.019> for<00:03:52.500> sports

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
to be swinging around even for sports

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.259 
to be swinging around even for sports
like<00:03:52.919> skydiving<00:03:53.220> that's<00:03:53.699> still<00:03:53.970> pretty

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
like skydiving that's still pretty

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.969 
like skydiving that's still pretty
dangerous<00:03:54.479> I'm<00:03:54.870> getting<00:03:55.079> hooked<00:03:55.229> on<00:03:55.440> stuff<00:03:55.739> so

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
dangerous I'm getting hooked on stuff so

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.300 
dangerous I'm getting hooked on stuff so
I<00:03:56.909> would<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.329> maybe<00:03:57.540> love<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.199> see<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.530> more

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I would have maybe love to see this more

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.670 
I would have maybe love to see this more
compact<00:04:00.120> where<00:04:00.449> maybe<00:04:01.169> they<00:04:01.290> gave<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.650> your

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
compact where maybe they gave you your

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.800 
compact where maybe they gave you your
own<00:04:01.889> options<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.729> this<00:04:02.819> buckle<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:03.389> because

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
own options of this buckle in because

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.349 
own options of this buckle in because
it's<00:04:03.959> buckles<00:04:04.290> again<00:04:04.769> pretty<00:04:05.159> big<00:04:05.430> maybe<00:04:06.120> they

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
it's buckles again pretty big maybe they

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.659 
it's buckles again pretty big maybe they
can't<00:04:07.290> with<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.500> smaller<00:04:07.949> version<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.549> this

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
can't with a smaller version of this

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.509 
can't with a smaller version of this
clip<00:04:08.940> here<00:04:09.269> or<00:04:09.479> maybe<00:04:10.290> I'm<00:04:10.650> sure<00:04:11.040> we<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.370> come

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
clip here or maybe I'm sure we can come

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.539 
clip here or maybe I'm sure we can come
up<00:04:11.579> with<00:04:11.699> a<00:04:11.790> way<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.180> DIY<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.099> mount<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.340> just

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
up with a way of DIY a mount that just

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.879 
up with a way of DIY a mount that just
cooks<00:04:14.760> directly<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.599> this<00:04:15.989> split<00:04:16.709> ring

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
cooks directly on to this split ring

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.830 
cooks directly on to this split ring
here<00:04:17.310> right<00:04:17.579> up<00:04:17.699> against<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.269> camera<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:18.720> we

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
here right up against the camera so we

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.990 
here right up against the camera so we
could<00:04:18.959> probably<00:04:19.169> make<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.409> shorter<00:04:19.919> but<00:04:20.789> I

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
could probably make this shorter but I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.029 
could probably make this shorter but I
like<00:04:21.449> this<00:04:21.659> kind<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.169> idea<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.800> wasn't

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
like this kind of idea and it wasn't

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.100 
like this kind of idea and it wasn't
something<00:04:23.340> I'd<00:04:23.669> ever<00:04:23.700> really<00:04:24.419> thought<00:04:24.719> of<00:04:24.930> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
something I'd ever really thought of and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.970 
something I'd ever really thought of and
so<00:04:25.860> when<00:04:26.099> excess

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
so when excess

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.470 
so when excess
scuba<00:04:27.430> reached<00:04:27.670> out<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.060> said<00:04:28.270> we've<00:04:28.450> got

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
scuba reached out and said we've got

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.270 
scuba reached out and said we've got
this<00:04:28.870> product<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.590> was<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.920> know<00:04:30.040> it's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
this product I was like you know it's

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.030 
this product I was like you know it's
pretty<00:04:30.610> cool<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.690> very<00:04:32.500> interesting

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
pretty cool and it is a very interesting

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.130 
pretty cool and it is a very interesting
idea<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.610> having<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:34.060> quicker<00:04:34.390> tractor<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.080> a

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
idea of having a quicker tractor on a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.510 
idea of having a quicker tractor on a
GoPro<00:04:35.860> camera<00:04:36.810> but<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.960> think<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:39.100> everyday

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
GoPro camera but I think for everyday

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.960 
GoPro camera but I think for everyday
use<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.180> for<00:04:40.570> high<00:04:40.750> action<00:04:41.080> sports<00:04:41.380> it's

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
use and for high action sports it's

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.310 
use and for high action sports it's
great<00:04:42.970> because<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.420> have<00:04:43.720> quick<00:04:43.870> access<00:04:44.020> to

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
great because you have quick access to

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.290 
great because you have quick access to
your<00:04:44.380> camera<00:04:44.650> but<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.070> isn't<00:04:45.520> going<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.000> be<00:04:46.120> the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
your camera but it isn't going to be the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.050 
your camera but it isn't going to be the
kind<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.630> thing<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.610> strong<00:04:48.610> enough<00:04:48.640> and

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
kind of thing that is strong enough and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.030 
kind of thing that is strong enough and
reliable<00:04:49.630> enough<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.020> small<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.620> compact

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
reliable enough and small and compact

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.160 
reliable enough and small and compact
enough<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> keep<00:04:51.910> your<00:04:52.060> camera<00:04:52.390> from<00:04:52.570> bouncing

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
enough to keep your camera from bouncing

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.470 
enough to keep your camera from bouncing
around<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.650> thus<00:04:53.980> even<00:04:54.820> if<00:04:54.940> you're<00:04:55.060> using<00:04:55.090> it

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
around and thus even if you're using it

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.540 
around and thus even if you're using it
you're<00:04:55.570> probably<00:04:55.870> going<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.680> be<00:04:56.800> more<00:04:57.040> annoyed

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
you're probably going to be more annoyed

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.670 
you're probably going to be more annoyed
with<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:58.060> like<00:04:58.360> because<00:04:58.930> this<00:04:59.170> is<00:04:59.320> just<00:04:59.500> like

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
with it like because this is just like

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.200 
with it like because this is just like
this<00:04:59.860> is<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.040> lot<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.460> camera<00:05:00.970> swing<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.540> be<00:05:03.210> when

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
this is a lot of camera swing to be when

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.910 
this is a lot of camera swing to be when
you're<00:05:04.330> skiing<00:05:04.600> or<00:05:04.990> something<00:05:05.290> like<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.440> so

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
you're skiing or something like that so

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.490 
you're skiing or something like that so
definitely<00:05:06.580> aimed<00:05:07.090> at<00:05:07.360> scuba<00:05:07.870> diving<00:05:08.290> where

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
definitely aimed at scuba diving where

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.530 
definitely aimed at scuba diving where
there's<00:05:08.710> not<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:08.920> much<00:05:09.220> impact<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:10.030> because

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
there's not so much impact and because

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.660 
there's not so much impact and because
of<00:05:10.570> your<00:05:11.140> buoyancy<00:05:11.950> and<00:05:12.130> water<00:05:12.370> it's<00:05:12.610> not

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
of your buoyancy and water it's not

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.960 
of your buoyancy and water it's not
going<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.030> be<00:05:13.120> an<00:05:13.210> issue<00:05:13.480> as<00:05:13.870> much<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.800> think

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
going to be an issue as much so I think

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.210 
going to be an issue as much so I think
awesome<00:05:15.970> for<00:05:16.120> scuba<00:05:16.390> diving<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.590> could<00:05:18.040> be

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
awesome for scuba diving and it could be

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.430 
awesome for scuba diving and it could be
interesting<00:05:18.730> for<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.450> rest<00:05:19.780> of<00:05:20.050> us<00:05:20.170> in

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
interesting for the rest of us in

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.040 
interesting for the rest of us in
certain<00:05:21.280> situations<00:05:22.180> when<00:05:22.360> maybe<00:05:22.540> it's<00:05:22.840> being

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
certain situations when maybe it's being

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.200 
certain situations when maybe it's being
used<00:05:23.380> not<00:05:24.160> as<00:05:24.460> a<00:05:24.880> sole<00:05:26.100> mounting<00:05:27.100> property<00:05:28.000> and

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
used not as a sole mounting property and

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.670 
used not as a sole mounting property and
then<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.600> other<00:05:28.810> thing<00:05:29.170> that's<00:05:29.260> cool<00:05:29.380> with<00:05:29.590> it

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
then the other thing that's cool with it

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.100 
then the other thing that's cool with it
here<00:05:29.890> is<00:05:30.070> there<00:05:30.520> is<00:05:30.700> a<00:05:30.730> clip<00:05:31.060> on<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.630> end<00:05:31.840> of

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
here is there is a clip on the end of

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.670 
here is there is a clip on the end of
the<00:05:32.440> retractor<00:05:33.010> which<00:05:33.190> allows<00:05:33.430> you<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.610> unclip

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
the retractor which allows you to unclip

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.620 
the retractor which allows you to unclip
the<00:05:35.680> mount<00:05:36.010> so<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.640> camera<00:05:37.120> quick<00:05:37.300> release

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
the mount so the camera quick release

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.170 
the mount so the camera quick release
and<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:38.110> retractor<00:05:38.650> into<00:05:39.040> two<00:05:39.190> pieces<00:05:39.430> so

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
and the retractor into two pieces so

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.520 
and the retractor into two pieces so
that<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.300> can<00:05:40.480> take<00:05:40.660> your<00:05:40.750> camera<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.080> go<00:05:41.380> off

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
that you can take your camera and go off

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.290 
that you can take your camera and go off
and<00:05:41.560> shoot<00:05:41.920> without<00:05:42.160> using<00:05:42.790> the<00:05:42.850> retractor

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
and shoot without using the retractor

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.970 
and shoot without using the retractor
but<00:05:43.540> like<00:05:44.050> I<00:05:44.110> said<00:05:44.260> before<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.590> 32<00:05:44.860> inch

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
but like I said before the 32 inch

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.590 
but like I said before the 32 inch
extension<00:05:45.370> is<00:05:45.490> long<00:05:45.670> enough<00:05:45.880> for<00:05:45.910> basically

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
extension is long enough for basically

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.840 
extension is long enough for basically
my<00:05:46.810> wingspan<00:05:47.170> which<00:05:47.530> no<00:05:48.310> one<00:05:48.460> really<00:05:48.490> has<00:05:48.820> a

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
my wingspan which no one really has a

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.440 
my wingspan which no one really has a
larger<00:05:49.570> wingspan<00:05:49.780> than<00:05:50.080> me<00:05:50.230> so<00:05:51.030> it<00:05:52.030> should<00:05:52.420> be

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
larger wingspan than me so it should be

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.140 
larger wingspan than me so it should be
fine<00:05:52.750> for<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:53.080> guys<00:05:53.770> this<00:05:54.250> was<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.550> retractor

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
fine for you guys this was a retractor

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.430 
fine for you guys this was a retractor
