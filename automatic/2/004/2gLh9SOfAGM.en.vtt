00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
for Jamie that was like 22 and a half to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.929 
for Jamie that was like 22 and a half to
one<00:01:34.619> Wow<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:39.270> Patrick's<00:01:39.780> gonna<00:01:39.960> bet<00:01:40.259> it

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
one Wow and now Patrick's gonna bet it

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.139 
one Wow and now Patrick's gonna bet it
forty-five<00:01:41.939> grand<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.930> he's<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.320> ace<00:01:43.500> king

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.880 

Jamie<00:01:48.149> knows<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.899> Patrick<00:01:49.409> doesn't<00:01:49.560> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
Jamie knows that Patrick doesn't have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.999 
Jamie knows that Patrick doesn't have
Jack<00:01:50.159> nine<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> Jamie<00:01:52.020> should<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.409> realize

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
Jack nine but Jamie should also realize

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.520 
Jack nine but Jamie should also realize
he<00:01:53.549> only<00:01:53.850> bet<00:01:54.060> fifteen<00:01:54.509> thousand<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> flop

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
he only bet fifteen thousand on the flop

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.429 
he only bet fifteen thousand on the flop
so<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.310> possible<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:57.299> Patrick<00:01:58.020> has<00:01:58.200> ace

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so it's possible that Patrick has ace

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.429 
so it's possible that Patrick has ace
Jack<00:01:59.210> but<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:00.689> Jamie<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.200> stop

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
Jack but I don't think Jamie can stop

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.940 
Jack but I don't think Jamie can stop
himself

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.150 

I<00:02:06.579> raise<00:02:08.410> Jamie's<00:02:09.410> got<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> raise<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.069> he's

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
I raise Jamie's got a raise and he's

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.490 
I raise Jamie's got a raise and he's
going<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:10.519> pod<00:02:10.759> committed<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.500> Patrick's

gonna be a three to one favor man

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.080 
gonna be a three to one favor man
because<00:02:17.900> whatever<00:02:18.140> he<00:02:18.470> raises<00:02:18.970> Patrick<00:02:19.970> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
because whatever he raises Patrick is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.839 
because whatever he raises Patrick is
