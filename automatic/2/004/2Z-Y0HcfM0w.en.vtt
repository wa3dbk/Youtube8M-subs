00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
guys already knew this but it takes a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
guys already knew this but it takes a
five-shot<00:00:45.870> minimum<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.620> kill<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> DMR

the<00:02:55.590> same<00:02:55.950> ridicule<00:02:56.490> aim<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> head<00:02:58.080> and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
the same ridicule aim for the head and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:08.990 
the same ridicule aim for the head and
have<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.310> same<00:02:59.640> exact<00:03:00.270> bullet<00:03:00.780> spread<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.910> as

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
have the same exact bullet spread so as

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.160 
have the same exact bullet spread so as
you<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.240> see<00:03:09.300> it's<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.690> little<00:03:09.810> bit<00:03:10.050> more

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
you can see it's a little bit more

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.200 
you can see it's a little bit more
costly<00:03:10.710> if<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.130> go<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.580> head<00:03:11.790> because

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
costly if you go for the head because

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.300 
costly if you go for the head because
with<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.420> same<00:03:12.930> bullet<00:03:13.350> spread<00:03:13.560> you're

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
with that same bullet spread you're

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.220 
with that same bullet spread you're
going<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.520> be<00:03:14.640> missing<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> body<00:03:15.330> three<00:03:16.140> out

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
going to be missing the body three out

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.500 
going to be missing the body three out
of<00:03:16.260> four<00:03:16.500> times<00:03:16.820> whereas<00:03:17.820> if<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> were<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.360> aim

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
of four times whereas if you were to aim

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.210 
of four times whereas if you were to aim
the<00:03:18.690> ridicule<00:03:19.140> at<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> fatter<00:03:19.710> part<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the ridicule at a fatter part of the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.430 
the ridicule at a fatter part of the
body<00:03:20.430> or<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.700> torso<00:03:21.360> you'd<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.080> hitting<00:03:22.260> them

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
body or the torso you'd be hitting them

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.949 
body or the torso you'd be hitting them
four<00:03:22.800> times<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.430> be<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.300> more<00:03:24.360> efficient

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.460 

killing<00:03:30.709> frenzy

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.550 

yeah<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.630> now<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.990> guys<00:03:41.110> have<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.350> gun

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
yeah so now that you guys have the gun

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.470 
yeah so now that you guys have the gun
basics<00:03:41.980> down<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.460> important<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.970> know<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
basics down it's important to know the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.770 
basics down it's important to know the
two<00:03:43.750> other<00:03:44.110> things<00:03:44.710> in<00:03:44.950> halo<00:03:45.160> which<00:03:45.520> is

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
two other things in halo which is

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.460 
two other things in halo which is
punching<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.990> grenades

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
punching and grenades

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.200 
punching and grenades
now<00:03:50.470> punching<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.340> different<00:03:52.090> from

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
now punching in this is different from

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.300 
now punching in this is different from
the<00:03:52.360> previous<00:03:52.510> halos<00:03:53.170> because<00:03:53.770> punching<00:03:54.220> in

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
the previous halos because punching in

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.000 
the previous halos because punching in
this<00:03:54.490> either<00:03:55.030> takes<00:03:55.540> down<00:03:55.960> their<00:03:56.290> shields<00:03:56.860> or

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
this either takes down their shields or

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.090 
this either takes down their shields or
kills<00:03:57.820> them<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.840> if<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.140> have<00:03:59.320> three<00:03:59.770> shots

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
kills them so if you have three shots

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.490 
kills them so if you have three shots
put<00:04:00.460> into<00:04:00.760> them<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.840> know<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:01.990> might<00:04:02.260> as<00:04:02.380> well

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
put into them you know you might as well

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.080 
put into them you know you might as well
put<00:04:02.710> a<00:04:02.740> fourth<00:04:03.100> in<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.460> take<00:04:03.640> down<00:04:03.850> their

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
put a fourth in to take down their

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.700 
put a fourth in to take down their
shields<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.540> then<00:04:04.780> finish<00:04:05.140> them<00:04:05.290> off<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.680> kill

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
shields and then finish them off to kill

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.800 
shields and then finish them off to kill
them<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.250> always<00:04:06.880> like<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.120> think<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.660> is

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
them I always like to think of it is

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.050 
them I always like to think of it is
almost<00:04:08.080> like<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.290> sniper<00:04:08.709> rifle<00:04:08.980> shot<00:04:09.430> that

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
almost like a sniper rifle shot that

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.690 
almost like a sniper rifle shot that
doesn't<00:04:10.270> hit<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.660> head<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:12.040> sniper<00:04:12.250> rifle

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
doesn't hit the head so the sniper rifle

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.970 
doesn't hit the head so the sniper rifle
will<00:04:12.790> either<00:04:12.940> take<00:04:13.300> down<00:04:13.570> their<00:04:13.780> shields<00:04:14.260> or

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
will either take down their shields or

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.750 
will either take down their shields or
kill<00:04:15.400> them<00:04:16.530> here's<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.590> great<00:04:17.980> example<00:04:18.580> of

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
kill them here's a great example of

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.420 
kill them here's a great example of
mailing<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.840> kill<00:04:20.170> with<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.859> shield's<00:04:21.220> down

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
shot now let's talk a little bit about

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.880 
shot now let's talk a little bit about
grenades<00:04:42.190> grenades<00:04:42.910> unlike<00:04:43.780> punching<00:04:44.470> has<00:04:44.860> a

grenades grenades unlike punching has a

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.860 
grenades grenades unlike punching has a
set<00:04:45.280> amount<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.610> damage<00:04:45.970> so<00:04:46.240> they<00:04:46.390> can<00:04:46.600> still

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
set amount of damage so they can still

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.240 
set amount of damage so they can still
have<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> little<00:04:47.169> bit<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.470> shields<00:04:47.830> left<00:04:48.070> in

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
have a little bit of shields left in

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.710 
have a little bit of shields left in
them<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.940> it'll<00:04:49.150> be<00:04:49.360> able<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.600> kill<00:04:49.870> them<00:04:51.720> this

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
them and it'll be able to kill them this

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.780 
them and it'll be able to kill them this
clip<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.169> perfect<00:04:53.650> example<00:04:54.250> because<00:04:54.280> it

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
clip is a perfect example because it

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.490 
clip is a perfect example because it
gains<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.180> upper<00:04:55.300> hand<00:04:55.570> by<00:04:56.110> throwing<00:04:56.410> a

grenade beforehand and that way most are
their<00:04:59.890> shields<00:05:00.280> are<00:05:00.340> down<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.850> we'll<00:05:01.060> be<00:05:01.180> able

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
their shields are down and we'll be able

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.830 
their shields are down and we'll be able
to<00:05:01.390> take<00:05:01.630> them<00:05:01.810> out<00:05:01.930> with<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.169> couple

to take them out with a couple

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.260 
to take them out with a couple
always<00:05:04.680> do<00:05:04.889> this<00:05:05.040> beforehand<00:05:05.699> to<00:05:05.970> get<00:05:06.150> the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
always do this beforehand to get the

always do this beforehand to get the
upper<00:05:06.540> hand<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:06.840> your<00:05:07.050> opponent<00:05:07.500> now<00:05:12.889> before
