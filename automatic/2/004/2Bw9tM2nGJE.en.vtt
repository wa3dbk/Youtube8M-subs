00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.620
 you will have to wait before downloading it 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.690
 however, it should not take long 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.640
 once arrived on this page for 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.860

 which we should wait 60 seconds for 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.229
 end of these 60 seconds we will have to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.569
 enter the captcha code that there 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.069
 different so don't copy mine but 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.160
 write the one that appears a 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.289
 you and then we click on continue 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.319
 finally just click on download the 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.539
 file in normal mode with the browser 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.490
 and will automatically start the 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.929
 download as you see below a 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.690
 left of the forest 0.09 b point exe 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.610
 now without starting the download e 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.330
 apple tree discharges since I already have it 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.099
 downloaded I am going to cancel the download 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.590
 once you have downloaded vi 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:58.729
 you will find a file identical to this one 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.560
 appunto the forest 0.09 b first of all 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.989
 before doing anything else and I recommend you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.869
 strongly to deactivate yours 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.700
 antivirus temporarily I now go to 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.530
 do it too 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.780
 this because we are going to install the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.760
 our game that will already be attacked e 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 so some crack files can 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.290
 be detected by our antivirus 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.060
 like fake viruses and there's risk 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.410
 precisely that our files come 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.020
 deleted by mistake 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.310
 then disable lohfink and install 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.960
 of the game 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.760
 once you have it, it is 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.590
 deactivated your antivirus 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.560
 just double click on it 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.200
 precisely the forest file 0.09 b 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.030
 downloaded right now and there 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.070
 will appear as you see this screen 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.020
 installation 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.360
 now we will simply have to choose the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.940
 folder where we want to install the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.590
 I recommend the forest to you 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.080
 leave this or that of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.450
 default installation found 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.160
 in local disc c games 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.410
 otherwise if you didn't install it in 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.050
 this destination can give you some 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.150
 mistakes you if you still want to change it 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.730
 because in any case it is only from the error 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.130
 always sometimes there is the risk it gives 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.450
 of the errors just for the card for the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.880
 destination folder 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.670
 if you still want to change it, it will be enough 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.160
 click on browse and select note 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.930
 the folder you prefer and finally 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.820
 click on ok 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.650
 I repeat, as I have already said, I prefer 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.560
 let this be live i recommend it 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.150
 also to you to avoid problems one 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.160
 once we have selected the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.980
 our folder will be enough to click on 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.810
 install and as you see it will start 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.740
 the actual installation of the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.020
 our the forest 0.09 b at the end 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.209
 the installation will open all of them 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.770
 these pages automatically 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.350
 don't worry it will simply be enough 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.300
 close our browser and close 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.160
