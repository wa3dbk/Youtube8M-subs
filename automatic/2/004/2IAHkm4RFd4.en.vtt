00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
we're going to show you how to replace

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.519 
we're going to show you how to replace
the<00:00:05.520> dated<00:00:05.819> fiber-optic<00:00:06.600> light<00:00:06.839> with<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> new

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
the dated fiber-optic light with a new

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.430 
the dated fiber-optic light with a new
LED<00:00:08.099> light<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:09.210> called<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> Savi<00:00:09.780> melody

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
LED light it's called the Savi melody

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.470 
LED light it's called the Savi melody
here<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.190> an<00:00:11.280> old<00:00:11.490> fiber-optic<00:00:12.179> light

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
here is an old fiber-optic light

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.640 
here is an old fiber-optic light
encasement<00:00:14.360> this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> new<00:00:15.809> LED<00:00:16.440> light

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
encasement this is the new LED light

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.970 
encasement this is the new LED light
that's<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.160> replacing<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.980> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that's going to be replacing that it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859 
that's going to be replacing that it
makes<00:00:20.189> no<00:00:20.460> noise<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:21.150> has<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.420> lot<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> different

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
makes no noise it has a lot of different

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.060 
makes no noise it has a lot of different
color<00:00:22.170> options<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.039> extremely<00:00:23.670> bright

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
color options and it's extremely bright

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.410 
color options and it's extremely bright
first<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.400> drain<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> pool<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> can

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
first we just drain the pool as you can

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.320 
first we just drain the pool as you can
see<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.560> remove<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> lens<00:00:29.640> cap<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
see and then remove the lens cap to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.700 
see and then remove the lens cap to
where<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> old<00:00:30.630> fiber-optic<00:00:31.199> light<00:00:31.380> used<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
where the old fiber-optic light used to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.660 
where the old fiber-optic light used to
be

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.660 

there's<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.390> old<00:00:40.510> lens<00:00:40.690> cover<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:42.340> won't<00:00:42.520> need

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
there's the old lens cover we won't need

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.040 
there's the old lens cover we won't need
that<00:00:42.730> anymore<00:00:42.850> we<00:00:43.360> can<00:00:43.450> disclose<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.870> bad

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
that anymore we can disclose the bad

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.020 
that anymore we can disclose the bad
then<00:00:44.950> we<00:00:45.040> just<00:00:45.220> cleaned<00:00:45.460> up<00:00:45.579> a<00:00:45.670> little<00:00:45.820> bit<00:00:45.940> of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
then we just cleaned up a little bit of

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
then we just cleaned up a little bit of
mold<00:00:46.239> that<00:00:46.329> was<00:00:46.540> inside<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.230> encasement

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.130 

generally<00:00:52.030> all<00:00:52.149> you'd<00:00:52.300> have<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.480> do<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:52.840> feed

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
generally all you'd have to do is feed

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.030 
generally all you'd have to do is feed
the<00:00:53.440> wire<00:00:53.680> up<00:00:54.370> through<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:55.650> PVC<00:00:56.650> piping

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
the wire up through the PVC piping

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.160 
the wire up through the PVC piping
that's<00:00:57.220> there<00:00:57.460> but<00:00:58.449> here<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.750> can<00:00:58.870> see<00:00:58.900> that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
that's there but here you can see that

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.569 
that's there but here you can see that
we<00:00:59.290> run<00:00:59.410> into<00:00:59.589> a<00:00:59.739> bit<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.100> joint<00:01:00.400> or

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
we run into a bit of a joint or

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.799 
we run into a bit of a joint or
something<00:01:01.059> that's<00:01:01.150> not<00:01:01.210> allowing<00:01:01.540> us<00:01:01.780> to

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
something that's not allowing us to

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.189 
something that's not allowing us to
thread<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.180> we're<00:01:04.420> using<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.750> water<00:01:04.960> pool

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
thread it so we're using a water pool

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:19.510 
thread it so we're using a water pool
tool<00:01:05.530> here<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.100> get<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.210> wire<00:01:07.390> through

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.760 

here<00:01:20.060> we're<00:01:20.180> trying<00:01:20.299> on<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.689> end<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.079> wire

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
here we're trying on the end of the wire

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.850 
here we're trying on the end of the wire
for<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.159> LED<00:01:22.460> light<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:24.500> will<00:01:24.619> make<00:01:24.710> it

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
for the LED light and this will make it

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.230 
for the LED light and this will make it
easy<00:01:25.040> now<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.280> pull<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:25.880> through<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
easy now to pull this up through the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:52.760 
easy now to pull this up through the
conduit

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.560 

there<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.909> wire<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> other

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
there we go we have to wire up the other

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
there we go we have to wire up the other
end<00:01:55.700> you'll<00:01:56.700> notice<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.530> regular

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
end you'll notice here in a regular

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
end you'll notice here in a regular
installation<00:01:59.570> this<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.110> into

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
installation this would go right into

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.929 
installation this would go right into
the<00:02:01.500> socket<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.040> we'd<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.670> done

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the socket and we'd be just about done

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.550 
the socket and we'd be just about done
the<00:02:03.090> installation<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> wiring

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the installation other than the wiring

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.449 
the installation other than the wiring
but<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.970> curve<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> conduit

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
but because of a curve on the conduit

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
but because of a curve on the conduit
the<00:02:08.459> mechanism<00:02:09.000> did<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.300> fit<00:02:09.599> smoothly<00:02:09.989> into

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the mechanism did not fit smoothly into

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
the mechanism did not fit smoothly into
the<00:02:10.649> conduit<00:02:11.400> itself<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.630> had<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:12.989> some

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the conduit itself so we had to do some

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.259 
the conduit itself so we had to do some
additional<00:02:13.530> work<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.190> here<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
additional work and you can see here the

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.300 
additional work and you can see here the
angle<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> conduit<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.500> angled<00:02:16.980> up<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.220> about

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
angle of conduit is angled up at about

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.940 
angle of conduit is angled up at about
45<00:02:17.819> degrees<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.200> need<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.410> clean<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
45 degrees so we need to clean up the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.339 
45 degrees so we need to clean up the
dirt<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:20.670> push<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.180> conduit<00:02:21.569> down<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
dirt and then push that conduit down to

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.320 
dirt and then push that conduit down to
get<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> straight<00:02:23.099> length<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.550> around<00:02:23.670> 14

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
get a straight length of around 14

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.110 
get a straight length of around 14
inches<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.860> order<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.190> allow<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> LED<00:02:26.910> light

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
inches in order to allow the LED light

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.340 
inches in order to allow the LED light
to<00:02:27.360> smoothly<00:02:27.690> glide<00:02:28.049> into<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.560> conduit<00:02:28.920> run

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
to smoothly glide into the conduit run

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.110 
to smoothly glide into the conduit run
you<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:31.500> see<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.920> where<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.250> forced<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.090> down

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you can see here where we forced it down

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.410 
you can see here where we forced it down
with<00:02:33.510> another<00:02:33.750> piece<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:33.989> PVC<00:02:34.860> piping<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:36.269> it

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
with another piece of PVC piping but it

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.070 
with another piece of PVC piping but it
did<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> trick

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
did the trick

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.530
