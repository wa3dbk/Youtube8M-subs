00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
wearing the same outfit all the game so

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.409 
wearing the same outfit all the game so
let's<00:04:20.400> have<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.549> look<00:04:20.639> at<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.820> New<00:04:20.970> York<00:04:21.120> outfit

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
let's have a look at the New York outfit

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.370 
let's have a look at the New York outfit
this<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.659> black<00:04:21.959> one<00:04:22.200> with<00:04:22.469> red<00:04:22.919> accents

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
this is a black one with red accents

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.570 
this is a black one with red accents
here<00:04:25.380> we<00:04:25.469> go<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.979> think<00:04:26.039> they<00:04:26.280> go<00:04:26.460> in

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
here we go and this I think they go in

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.230 
here we go and this I think they go in
order<00:04:26.729> of<00:04:26.880> cheating

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
order of cheating

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.700 
order of cheating
so<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.479> one<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.780> one<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> cheapest<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
so this one is one of the cheapest and a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.110 
so this one is one of the cheapest and a
lot<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.039> people<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.400> commented<00:04:29.550> when<00:04:30.000> I've

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
lot of people have commented when I've

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.450 
lot of people have commented when I've
been<00:04:30.330> wearing<00:04:30.539> this<00:04:30.750> one<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.319> missions<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.280> say

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
that they really like it not one of my

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.850
