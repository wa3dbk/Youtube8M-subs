in<00:03:17.969> it<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:21.500> bowls<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.099> hood

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
in it the bowls you see in the hood

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.130 
in it the bowls you see in the hood
right<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.849> very<00:03:24.239> similar<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.750> one

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
right there is very similar to one

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.890 
right there is very similar to one
that's<00:03:25.319> on<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.829> Triumph<00:03:26.670> GT<00:03:27.120> 6<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:27.689> is<00:03:27.870> a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
that's on a Triumph GT 6 which is a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.229 
that's on a Triumph GT 6 which is a
Spitfire<00:03:28.469> that<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> smaller<00:03:29.519> 6-cylinder

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
Spitfire that has a smaller 6-cylinder

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.979 
Spitfire that has a smaller 6-cylinder
engine<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.659> it<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.959> hardtop<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.989> just

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
engine in it in the hardtop and so just

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.949 
engine in it in the hardtop and so just
had<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.200> manufacture<00:03:35.060> just<00:03:36.060> kind<00:03:36.659> of<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.780> hood

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
had to manufacture just kind of a hood

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.099 
had to manufacture just kind of a hood
bulbs<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:37.470> very<00:03:37.650> similar<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.129> that

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
bulbs it's very similar to that

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.509 
bulbs it's very similar to that
although<00:03:40.109> Spitfires<00:03:40.650> didn't<00:03:40.950> have<00:03:41.069> one<00:03:41.250> there

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
although Spitfires didn't have one there

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.809 
although Spitfires didn't have one there
it<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:41.939> it<00:03:42.030> looks<00:03:42.420> fairly<00:03:43.079> stock<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.859> is

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
it is so it looks fairly stock and is

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.910 
it is so it looks fairly stock and is
very<00:03:45.209> close<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.750> what<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.959> Tramp<00:03:46.230> design<00:03:46.650> was

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
very close to what the Tramp design was

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.619 
very close to what the Tramp design was
and<00:03:47.219> tell<00:03:47.489> us<00:03:47.609> about<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.909> shifter<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.389> you

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
and tell us about the shifter that you

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.839 
and tell us about the shifter that you
built<00:03:48.900> here<00:03:49.170> custom-built<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.069> shifter<00:03:50.430> is

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
built here custom-built the shifter is

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.059 
built here custom-built the shifter is
that<00:03:51.120> it'll<00:03:51.329> come<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.689> the<00:03:52.139> shifter<00:03:52.530> right

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
that it'll come to the shifter right

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.369 
that it'll come to the shifter right
there<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.970> transmission<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.689> a<00:03:54.720> much

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
there it's the transmission is a much

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.409 
there it's the transmission is a much
larger<00:03:55.829> more<00:03:58.370> well<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.549> higher<00:03:59.760> gear

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
larger more well it's a higher gear

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.390 
larger more well it's a higher gear
ratio<00:04:00.870> much<00:04:01.260> stronger<00:04:01.590> transmission<00:04:02.189> it's<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
ratio much stronger transmission it's a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.809 
ratio much stronger transmission it's a
t5<00:04:02.819> transmission<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.590> gear<00:04:04.889> shifter

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
t5 transmission and the gear shifter

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.940 
t5 transmission and the gear shifter
actually<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.540> has<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.230> funny<00:04:07.409> angle<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.829> get

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
actually is has the funny angle to get

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.619 
actually is has the funny angle to get
around<00:04:08.250> your<00:04:08.430> leg<00:04:08.609> it's<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.939> very<00:04:09.150> very<00:04:09.359> small

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
around your leg it's a very very small

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.309 
around your leg it's a very very small
car<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.439> it<00:04:11.159> brings<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.700> shifter<00:04:12.120> out<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
car and it brings the shifter out of the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.809 
car and it brings the shifter out of the
way<00:04:13.439> it<00:04:13.709> becomes<00:04:14.069> very<00:04:14.280> very<00:04:14.489> comfortable

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
way it becomes very very comfortable

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.509 
way it becomes very very comfortable
where<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.689> is<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.680> relocates<00:04:17.340> the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
where it is but it just relocates the

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.449 
where it is but it just relocates the
shifter<00:04:18.440> because<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> new<00:04:19.829> powertrain

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
shifter because of the new powertrain

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.839 
shifter because of the new powertrain
and<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:21.479> smallness<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.229> car<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.520> notice

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
and the smallness of the car so notice

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.939 
and the smallness of the car so notice
the<00:04:24.000> several<00:04:24.330> angles<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:24.960> he<00:04:25.139> manufactured

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
the several angles that he manufactured

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.760 
the several angles that he manufactured
into<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> shifter<00:04:26.699> to<00:04:26.880> make<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> work<00:04:27.770> now

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
into the shifter to make it work now

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.159 
into the shifter to make it work now
it's<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.130> beautifully<00:04:29.789> comfortable<00:04:30.300> spot<00:04:33.169> and

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
it's a beautifully comfortable spot and

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.589 
it's a beautifully comfortable spot and
again<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:35.370> wanted<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.789> get<00:04:35.940> an<00:04:36.060> emphasis<00:04:36.300> on

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
again just wanted to get an emphasis on

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.629 
again just wanted to get an emphasis on
these<00:04:36.840> hand-built<00:04:37.560> hand-formed

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639
