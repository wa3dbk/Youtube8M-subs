00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
teen town so much better than what we

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
compare it is so much better than that

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
compare it is so much better than that
I<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.649> loved<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.250> town<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.640> felt<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> was

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
I just loved to town I felt like I was

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.830 
I just loved to town I felt like I was
walking<00:02:00.299> into<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> cartoon<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:02.549> was<00:02:02.700> great

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
walking into a cartoon and it was great

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.240 
walking into a cartoon and it was great
so<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> downsides<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.469> lot<00:02:08.129> of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so one of the downsides here is a lot of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.669 
so one of the downsides here is a lot of
the<00:02:08.369> queues<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> waiting<00:02:09.300> lines<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.750> outside

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the queues the waiting lines are outside

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.540 
the queues the waiting lines are outside
and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.700 
and
so<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.300> was<00:02:12.420> super<00:02:12.780> hot<00:02:12.990> like<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.470> dead

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
so if it was super hot like in the dead

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.240 
so if it was super hot like in the dead
summer<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:15.890> Disneyland

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
summer here Disneyland

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.270 
summer here Disneyland
then<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.330> would<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.510> hot<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.110> lot<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.860> here's<00:02:20.220> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
then you would be hot a lot so here's a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920 
then you would be hot a lot so here's a
little<00:02:20.400> tip<00:02:20.520> for<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.630> gonna<00:02:21.750> wait

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
little tip for you if you're gonna wait

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.960

in<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> super<00:02:22.440> long<00:02:22.590> line<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.520> really<00:02:23.790> probably

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
in a super long line you really probably

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.580 
in a super long line you really probably
need<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> wait<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.720> super<00:02:25.020> long<00:02:25.170> line<00:02:25.380> in

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
need to wait in that super long line in

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.380 
need to wait in that super long line in
the<00:02:25.740> evening<00:02:26.190> once<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.520> sort<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.000> Sun<00:02:27.210> Goes

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the evening once it sort of the Sun Goes

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.760 
the evening once it sort of the Sun Goes
Down<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.720> starts<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.050> cool<00:02:28.200> off<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.650> will

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
Down it starts to cool off that will

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.740 
Down it starts to cool off that will
definitely<00:02:28.920> help<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.820> lot<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:30.690> your

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
definitely help you a lot with your

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.660 
definitely help you a lot with your
temperature<00:02:31.140> stuff<00:02:31.470> another<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.370> little<00:02:32.550> bit

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
temperature stuff another a little bit

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
temperature stuff another a little bit
of<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.790> downside<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.260> lines<00:02:34.710> sort<00:02:35.160> of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
of a downside is that the lines sort of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.000 
of a downside is that the lines sort of
bleed<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:35.940> into<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> walkway<00:02:37.020> everything<00:02:37.950> is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
bleed out into the walkway everything is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.730 
bleed out into the walkway everything is
much<00:02:38.160> more<00:02:38.340> narrow<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.840> are

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
much more narrow and so you are

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.860 
much more narrow and so you are
constantly<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.430> walking<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.420> then<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.630> run

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
constantly like walking and then you run

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.630 
constantly like walking and then you run
up<00:02:42.990> against<00:02:43.260> somebody<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.950> they're<00:02:44.460> waiting

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
up against somebody and they're waiting

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.890 
up against somebody and they're waiting
in<00:02:44.850> line<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.450> hard<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.690> tell<00:02:45.870> like

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
in line and it's hard to tell like

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.260 
in line and it's hard to tell like
what's<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.440> line<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.070> what's<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.030> walking

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
what's a line and what's just a walking

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.070 
what's a line and what's just a walking
situation<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.300> was<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:51.720> bit<00:02:51.900> weird

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
situation so that was a little bit weird

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.550 
situation so that was a little bit weird

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.520 
I didn't feel like I had to just
constantly<00:03:20.640> power<00:03:20.880> through<00:03:21.270> another<00:03:22.260> thing<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
constantly power through another thing I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.140 
constantly power through another thing I
loved<00:03:22.770> about<00:03:22.800> Disneyland<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:24.030> very

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
loved about Disneyland is that it's very

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.190 
loved about Disneyland is that it's very
compact

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
compact

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.630 
compact
I<00:03:25.260> mean<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.500> ride<00:03:25.800> next<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.130> ride<00:03:26.340> next<00:03:26.520> to

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
I mean it's ride next to ride next to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.030 
I mean it's ride next to ride next to
ride<00:03:26.880> next<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.239> ride<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.709> feel<00:03:28.950> like

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
ride next to ride and so I feel like

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.530 
ride next to ride and so I feel like
when<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:29.280> at<00:03:29.370> Disney<00:03:29.610> World<00:03:29.640> many<00:03:30.030> times<00:03:30.300> I

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
when I'm at Disney World many times I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.840 
when I'm at Disney World many times I
exert<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.350> lot<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.770> energy<00:03:31.980> walking<00:03:32.400> from<00:03:32.700> one

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
exert a lot of energy walking from one

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.040 
exert a lot of energy walking from one
side<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.180> park<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.540> other<00:03:33.750> side<00:03:33.959> of

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
side of the park to the other side of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.330 
side of the park to the other side of
the<00:03:34.110> park<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.860> don't<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.280> that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the park and you don't have that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.610 
the park and you don't have that
situation<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.390> mean<00:03:36.720> my<00:03:36.870> feet<00:03:37.080> hurt<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.500> end

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
situation I mean my feet hurt at the end

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.350 
situation I mean my feet hurt at the end
of<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.739> day<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.070> was<00:03:38.160> nowhere<00:03:38.580> near<00:03:38.820> what

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
of the day but it was nowhere near what

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.660 
of the day but it was nowhere near what
it<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.660> when<00:03:40.260> I'm<00:03:40.380> at<00:03:40.530> Disney<00:03:40.770> World<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.370> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
it is when I'm at Disney World so I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.580 
it is when I'm at Disney World so I
really<00:03:42.420> like<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.750> things<00:03:42.930> were<00:03:43.050> closed<00:03:43.320> of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
really like that things were closed of

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.870 
really like that things were closed of
course<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.010> also<00:03:44.190> makes<00:03:44.520> things<00:03:44.610> more

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
course that also makes things more

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.080 
course that also makes things more
crowded<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.750> that's<00:03:46.700> one<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.880> downsides

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
crowded so that's one of the downsides

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.080 
crowded so that's one of the downsides
sort<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.800> perhaps<00:03:49.800> my<00:03:50.010> favorite<00:03:50.370> thing<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:50.880> far

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
sort of perhaps my favorite thing so far

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.510 
sort of perhaps my favorite thing so far
about<00:03:51.570> Disneyland<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.370> proximity<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:54.330> the

I love the Tropicana it feels very

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
see fireworks from my balcony last night

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.439 
see fireworks from my balcony last night
I'm<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.710> close<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.580> can<00:04:36.699> see<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.060> fireworks

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
I'm so close you can see the fireworks

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.090 
I'm so close you can see the fireworks
going<00:04:37.690> off<00:04:38.160> over<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.610> Matterhorn<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:41.100> it's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
going off over the Matterhorn so it's

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.150 
going off over the Matterhorn so it's
definitely<00:04:42.580> smaller<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:44.860> definitely

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
definitely smaller and it's definitely

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.090 
definitely smaller and it's definitely
more<00:04:45.490> compact<00:04:45.970> but<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:47.199> think<00:04:47.620> there's<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.860> sense

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
more compact but I think there's a sense

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.029 
more compact but I think there's a sense
of<00:04:48.220> intimacy<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:49.500> Disney<00:04:50.500> World<00:04:50.680> sort<00:04:50.979> of

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
of intimacy that Disney World sort of

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.820 
of intimacy that Disney World sort of
lacks<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.850> so<00:04:52.509> that's<00:04:53.020> sort<00:04:53.229> of<00:04:53.289> my<00:04:53.410> initial

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
lacks and so that's sort of my initial

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.870 
lacks and so that's sort of my initial
impression<00:04:54.400> my<00:04:55.240> co-writer<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:57.160> Disneyland

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
impression my co-writer the Disneyland

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.270 
impression my co-writer the Disneyland
diva<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.810> met<00:04:59.020> up<00:04:59.139> yesterday<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.770> many

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
diva and I met up yesterday and many

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.320 
diva and I met up yesterday and many
times<00:05:00.550> she'd<00:05:00.729> say<00:05:00.910> well<00:05:01.030> what<00:05:01.150> do<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.300> think

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
times she'd say well what do you think

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.999 
times she'd say well what do you think
what<00:05:01.660> do<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.780> think<00:05:01.870> what<00:05:02.169> do<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.289> think<00:05:02.380> and

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
what do you think what do you think and

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.020 
what do you think what do you think and
I<00:05:03.039> think<00:05:03.070> she<00:05:03.340> was<00:05:03.400> really<00:05:03.490> worried<00:05:03.759> about<00:05:03.820> me

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
I think she was really worried about me

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.659 
I think she was really worried about me
like<00:05:04.180> not<00:05:04.449> liking<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.930> but<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.530> really<00:05:06.009> do<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:06.520> I

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
like not liking it but I really do and I

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.249 
like not liking it but I really do and I
think<00:05:06.759> it's<00:05:07.150> because<00:05:07.509> it's<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.810> different

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
think it's because it's a different

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.740
