00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
look there's a line to get in it makes

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.679 
look there's a line to get in it makes
it<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.490> best<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:56.030> because<00:01:56.299> everybody's

it the best right because everybody's

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.059 
it the best right because everybody's
waiting<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.079> line<00:01:57.229> that's<00:01:57.530> how<00:01:57.710> that's<00:01:57.950> how

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
waiting in a line that's how that's how

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.910 
waiting in a line that's how that's how
that<00:01:58.159> works<00:01:58.490> right<00:01:58.640> there<00:01:59.539> is<00:01:59.719> a<00:01:59.750> line<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:00.409> get

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.490 
that works right there is a line to get
into<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.310> UV<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.240> apparently<00:02:02.929> it's<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.170> best

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500
