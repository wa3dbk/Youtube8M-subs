we're on this the procedures we're using

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.309 
we're on this the procedures we're using
here<00:01:46.119> are<00:01:46.179> going<00:01:46.359> to<00:01:46.420> be<00:01:46.509> similar<00:01:46.779> for

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
here are going to be similar for

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.230 
here are going to be similar for
plastics<00:01:47.859> as<00:01:47.979> well<00:01:48.159> we're<00:01:48.399> doing<00:01:48.639> vinyl<00:01:48.999> today

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
plastics as well we're doing vinyl today

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.569 
plastics as well we're doing vinyl today
obviously<00:01:49.419> but<00:01:50.409> if<00:01:50.499> you<00:01:50.619> use<00:01:50.919> in<00:01:51.069> plastic

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
obviously but if you use in plastic

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.779 
obviously but if you use in plastic
there<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.849> a<00:01:51.880> plastic<00:01:52.240> prep<00:01:52.719> that<00:01:52.899> sim<00:01:53.139> has<00:01:53.789> we

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
there is a plastic prep that sim has we

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.870 
there is a plastic prep that sim has we
may<00:01:54.939> go<00:01:55.119> into<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.509> little<00:01:55.659> bit<00:01:55.810> later<00:01:56.439> but

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
may go into that a little bit later but

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.709 
may go into that a little bit later but
some<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:57.999> procedures<00:01:58.450> are<00:01:58.599> the<00:01:58.630> same

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
some of the procedures are the same

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.690 
some of the procedures are the same
other<00:01:59.079> than<00:01:59.319> you<00:01:59.439> would<00:01:59.560> use<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.799> plastic<00:02:00.249> prep

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
other than you would use a plastic prep

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.739 
other than you would use a plastic prep
for<00:02:00.999> the<00:02:01.149> if<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:02.020> was<00:02:02.139> doing<00:02:02.349> plastics<00:02:02.859> and

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
for the if you was doing plastics and

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.899 
for the if you was doing plastics and
then<00:02:04.749> we<00:02:04.959> have<00:02:05.169> the<00:02:05.349> color<00:02:05.529> coat<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:06.669> color

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
then we have the color coat the color

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.889 
then we have the color coat the color
coat<00:02:07.209> is<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.569> sim<00:02:08.020> product<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.690> mainly

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
coat is a sim product this is mainly

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.809 
coat is a sim product this is mainly
what<00:02:11.170> you'd<00:02:11.349> use<00:02:11.560> for<00:02:11.590> vinyls<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.340> plastics

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
what you'd use for vinyls and plastics

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.450 
what you'd use for vinyls and plastics
there<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.690> one<00:02:13.960> called<00:02:14.170> sure<00:02:14.530> coat<00:02:14.830> if<00:02:15.070> you

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
there is one called sure coat if you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.250 
there is one called sure coat if you

were ever doing leather thank you
used<00:02:17.379> for<00:02:17.590> leather<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.159> there's<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
used for leather and there's also a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.220 
used for leather and there's also a
different<00:02:19.120> prep<00:02:19.360> if<00:02:19.569> he<00:02:19.659> was<00:02:19.780> ever<00:02:19.900> doing

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
different prep if he was ever doing

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.559

leather but the shirt or the color coat

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.470 
leather but the shirt or the color coat
is<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.170> would<00:02:23.290> use<00:02:23.349> for<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:25.030> doing<00:02:25.180> by

penetrate the surface with a rag just to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.220 
penetrate the surface with a rag just to
kind<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.849> push<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.390> there<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.959> kind<00:02:53.109> of

continue<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> do<00:02:59.109> this<00:02:59.319> until<00:02:59.739> it<00:03:00.280> no<00:03:00.549> longer

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
continue to do this until it no longer

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.479 
continue to do this until it no longer
beads<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.599> if<00:03:01.780> you're<00:03:01.989> still<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:03.099> it's<00:03:03.280> still

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
beads so if you're still if it's still

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.430 
beads so if you're still if it's still
kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.790> beating<00:03:04.120> up<00:03:04.269> like<00:03:04.569> there's<00:03:04.870> maybe

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
kind of beating up like there's maybe

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.410 
kind of beating up like there's maybe
there<00:03:06.069> shouldn't<00:03:06.280> be<00:03:06.400> any<00:03:06.549> wax<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.239> but

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
there shouldn't be any wax on this but

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.059 
there shouldn't be any wax on this but
if<00:03:07.510> somebody<00:03:07.810> put<00:03:08.049> maybe<00:03:08.200> armor-all<00:03:08.709> or

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
if somebody put maybe armor-all or

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.530 
if somebody put maybe armor-all or
something<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:09.549> that<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.909> this<00:03:10.120> you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
something like that on this you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.789 
something like that on this you
definitely<00:03:10.750> want<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.319> get<00:03:11.440> all<00:03:11.620> that

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
definitely want to get all that

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.009 
definitely want to get all that
contamination<00:03:12.459> off<00:03:12.760> there<00:03:13.030> before<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.780> try

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
contamination off there before you try

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.349 
contamination off there before you try
to<00:03:14.049> apply<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.950> paint<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.519> if<00:03:15.609> it's<00:03:15.760> beating<00:03:16.180> up

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
to apply the paint so if it's beating up

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.960 
to apply the paint so if it's beating up
like<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.230> would<00:03:17.379> see<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.829> car<00:03:18.129> you<00:03:18.670> know<00:03:18.760> on

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
like you would see on a car you know on

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.940 
like you would see on a car you know on
a<00:03:19.030> car<00:03:19.269> you'll<00:03:19.540> see<00:03:19.750> wax<00:03:20.230> where<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.709> will<00:03:20.799> beat

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
a car you'll see wax where it will beat

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.020 
a car you'll see wax where it will beat
up<00:03:21.129> if<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:21.760> still<00:03:22.060> needs<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:23.199> on<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.470> surface

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
up if it still needs up on the surface

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.879 
up if it still needs up on the surface
and<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.209> want<00:03:25.449> to<00:03:25.510> make<00:03:25.660> sure<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.500> get<00:03:26.709> all
