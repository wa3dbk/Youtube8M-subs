00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 yes people welcome you to welcome 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.200
 I want this video in this video 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.340
 Just give my mindset 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.230
 like her famous 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.280
 get to know personalities resp 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 Generally, many of you think that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 have follow me on facebook and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 there since then again and again pictures like 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.779
 For example , we recently joined 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 google 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 my business partner and me and with it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 written a few thousand years ago 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.060
 why google how can i do it too 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.890
 to come to google and I can tell you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.420
 let's say that directly at one 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.590
 People like that in almost all of them here 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.110
 really the photos go with me 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.920
 prominent people from germany from the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.899
 States and so on I have the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 attitudes or mindset is that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.039
 I'll read a book sometime 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 brian tracy he said you did 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 really amazing is in what you're doing 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 then these people come to you and that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.430
 I have read a lot on the whole 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.890
 beginning of my career 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 No, I do not crawl any 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 People I want that people to me 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.230
 Of course it can be said here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 Of course, richard branson is not too 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.789
 come to me 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.439
 that was natural because I was on one 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.030
 spoke event indeed 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.830
 But I have to this question 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.880
 spoken because I am only my name 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.640
 built and thus I have one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 get to know a little bit whatever 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.920
 I want to say that she should be the one 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 attitude to be so good in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 what you do that makes you people 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.119
 come because otherwise since then countries yes 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.009
 you are countries 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.810
 if you are all the time around dur 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.950
 surroundings on any parties and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.900
 try the whole with any 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
 people come in contact with it of course 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.750
 are now, you can now you have to pay 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.320
 not again generalize there 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 Industry sectors 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.259
 You have to do that and have none 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.150
 another choice would really have to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.229
 wait for people to come to you or 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.640
 then you really have to be proactive 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.490
 I do not want to go to people 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.409
 generalizing disagree but it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 does not try to try 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.210
 to write the people to dance and the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.409
 to run after so much what me 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.350
 it makes more sense to do something 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.430
 which really has substance and okay then 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 maybe you can do this again 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 It was general I say it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.920
 be honest now most of you 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.479
 people will come to you someday if you 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.579
 a certain level reached 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.350
 Let's take what you do not care 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.450
 which industry does not matter in which business 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.580
 At some point, people come to you and 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 that's my mindset I 'm not telling myself 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.380
 if somebody i want that people too 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.450
 I come or not 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.130
 it is the adaptation to arrogant yes 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.260
 anyway, I do not think so 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.820
 but takes place immediately and if one 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.430
 have reached certain level then come 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.470
 just people to you yes and that is 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.720
 My mainz granted that is my opinion 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.520
 that I really want to say so 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.050
 be good that these persons person 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.750
 I like to talk to you like that 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.210
 and not because I'm somehow 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.520
 just tried to push on 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.200
 to build something with substance yes and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.880
 if you really have substance if you 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.140
 really created something then is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.630
 of course interesting for others 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.830
 Being big in the company of everyone 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.210
 are human has equal value 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.130
 mean anything is just there 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.170
 for example, people like the entrepreneur 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.060
 are simply stronger 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.500
 already set up and take millions 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.670
 the and of course prefers to keep up 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.110
 leeks with millions of people 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.070
 that's what companies have built up 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.810
 not meant evil but the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.160
 Entrepreneurs always have little time and money 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.650
 Have to watch where you are with your time 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.020
 yes or today anyway 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.550
 So my bed is bordeaux something on 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.540
 and then do not let people on me 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.550
 it sounds like that already 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.110
 but arrogant has a time meant the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.610
 the follow time and it brings 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.290
 Do not you all the more people to 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.150
 run and try this one 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.920
 pull up the skirt so yes I see 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.600
 the more likely that it what I times a 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.340
 lord because like you every human has the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.930
 possibility to build apps and it is 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.520
 much cooler with someone at eye level 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.300
 to talk or at least to werner knows 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.160
 at eye level 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.090
 rather than trying to try the whole 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.710
 time any people call heart 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.420
 burning and that is a big misconception 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.620
 that you just think because you somehow 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.610
 knows successful effect and also 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.560
 Of course you can be successful 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.660
 mainz but now happen if from 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.130
 in the first place is means wrong is one can 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.350
 will think only then only so 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.209
 successful because it is nonsense that is 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.500
 perfect nonsense 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.200
 okay as far as I wanted to go 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.490
 short in my opinion that in this regard 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.900
 give if you liked the video 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.370
 please him give this one again 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.120
 thumbs up or ladder that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.620
 video but no one youtube channel or 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.480
 or easily my facebook 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.209
 page and see you next time 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.209
 video again until then all the best
