hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.719> what<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.079> up<00:00:01.199> Jonesy<00:00:01.620> here<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.070> I

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hey guys what is up Jonesy here and I

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys what is up Jonesy here and I
figured<00:00:02.669> out<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.850> read<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.049> dots<00:00:04.650> and

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
figured out how to read the the dots and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.619 
figured out how to read the the dots and
circles<00:00:05.160> at<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.819> top<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> church<00:00:06.420> when

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
circles at the top of the church when

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.970 
circles at the top of the church when
you're<00:00:06.720> trying<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.960> upgrade<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.440> fire<00:00:07.649> staff

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
you're trying to upgrade the fire staff

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.240 
you're trying to upgrade the fire staff
so<00:00:08.519> what<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.760> called<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.269> ternary<00:00:09.870> code<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:11.070> in

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
so what is called is ternary code so in

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.150 
so what is called is ternary code so in
ternary<00:00:11.730> code<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:12.570> three<00:00:13.080> numbers<00:00:13.259> two

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
ternary code you have three numbers two

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.129 
ternary code you have three numbers two
dots<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.360> top<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> other<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:16.020> you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
dots like one on top of the other as you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
dots like one on top of the other as you
can<00:00:16.260> see<00:00:16.379> right<00:00:16.560> there<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.340> picture<00:00:17.670> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
can see right there on the picture is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.109 
can see right there on the picture is
two<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.779> knot<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:20.430> open<00:00:20.730> circle

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
two one knot is one and an open circle

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.290 
two one knot is one and an open circle
is<00:00:21.359> zero<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.470> looking<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.519> lit<00:00:24.150> up

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
is zero so looking at the first lit up

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.529 
is zero so looking at the first lit up
dots<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.710> game<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.099> had<00:00:26.340> um<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:27.180> 1

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
dots that in this game we had um is 1

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
dots that in this game we had um is 1
and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:27.930> 2<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:29.010> call<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> 12<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.060> if

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and then 2 so I just call that 12 and if

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.910 
and then 2 so I just call that 12 and if
you<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> decimal<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.529> decimal

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
you look at the decimal that decimal

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.819 
you look at the decimal that decimal
would<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.130> 5<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.020> me<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.620> into

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
would be 5 now if you want me to go into

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.080 
would be 5 now if you want me to go into
depth<00:00:35.070> about<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> decimals<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
depth about how the decimals and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
depth about how the decimals and
everything<00:00:36.450> work<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
everything work I don't know but what I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.340 
everything work I don't know but what I
do<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> decimal<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
do know is that the decimal you have is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.040 
do know is that the decimal you have is
the<00:00:40.620> torch<00:00:40.950> number<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.579> hit<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.450> looking

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the torch number that you hit so looking

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.840 
the torch number that you hit so looking
at<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> second<00:00:43.739> symbol<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.579> lit<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
at the second symbol that we have lit up

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
at the second symbol that we have lit up
on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> wall<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> 2<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.649> 1<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
on the wall we have a 2 and a 1 and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
on the wall we have a 2 and a 1 and
looking<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> chart<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> bottom<00:00:48.840> right

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
looking at the chart in the bottom right

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.310 
looking at the chart in the bottom right
corner<00:00:49.190> 21<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> decimal<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.420> 7<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.289> now

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
corner 21 as a decimal of 7 so now

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.200 
corner 21 as a decimal of 7 so now
looking<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> third<00:00:53.460> symbol<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.090> have

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
looking at the third symbol that we have

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.170 
looking at the third symbol that we have
on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> wall<00:00:54.600> wave<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> 2<00:00:55.170> &amp;<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.590> 0<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:56.430> 20<00:00:56.910> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
on the wall wave a 2 &amp; a 0 now 20 in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
on the wall wave a 2 &amp; a 0 now 20 in
ternary<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> decimal<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.219> again

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
ternary the decimal as you can see again

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
ternary the decimal as you can see again
in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> chart<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> 6<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> point<00:01:01.800> we

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
in the chart is a 6 so at this point we

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.870 
in the chart is a 6 so at this point we
have<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> numbers<00:01:03.120> 5<00:01:03.930> 7<00:01:04.739> 6<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.580> need<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
have the numbers 5 7 6 that we need to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.390 
have the numbers 5 7 6 that we need to
hit<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.659> finally<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.619> 1<00:01:07.979> 1<00:01:08.189> which

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
hit and then finally we have 1 1 which

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.510 
hit and then finally we have 1 1 which
is<00:01:08.549> 11<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> decimal<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.900> 4<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.520> since

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
is 11 and the decimal is 4 and since

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.390 
is 11 and the decimal is 4 and since
there<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.909> no<00:01:12.210> 4<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.659> any<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> torches<00:01:14.130> we

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
there is no 4 on any of the torches we

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370 
there is no 4 on any of the torches we
just<00:01:14.670> call<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> blood<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
just call that blood so that is the the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
just call that blood so that is the the
blood<00:01:16.680> smear<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> hit<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> always

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
blood smear that you hit which is always

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
blood smear that you hit which is always
always<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.110> lit<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
always going to be lit up so that is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
always going to be lit up so that is
always<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.460> last<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> hit<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
always the last one you want to hit to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
always the last one you want to hit to
activate<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.950> orb<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.759> Hall<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
activate the the orb in the Hall of the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.160 
activate the the orb in the Hall of the
Ancients<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
Ancients so now that we have on the the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
Ancients so now that we have on the the
symbols<00:01:28.619> decoded<00:01:29.189> we're<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.400> head

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
symbols decoded we're gonna head

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.630 
symbols decoded we're gonna head
downstairs<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.450> using<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.890> our<00:01:32.100> code<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
downstairs and using all our code that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
downstairs and using all our code that
we<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.880> game<00:01:33.030> we're<00:01:33.150> gonna<00:01:33.210> hit<00:01:33.420> 5<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
we have this game we're gonna hit 5 and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
we have this game we're gonna hit 5 and
then<00:01:34.890> next<00:01:35.220> we're<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.549> run<00:01:35.850> over<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> we're
