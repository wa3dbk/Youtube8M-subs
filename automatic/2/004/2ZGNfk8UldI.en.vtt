 Yes, this time in Ogawa 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.800
 It's a bit cloudy though 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.300
 I would like to catch Medaka 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.860
 Something exciting and exciting 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.860
 After all 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.060
 I would like to take water creatures 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.940
 I am very excited 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.640
 After 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 I do not know if there is a crayfish 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.000
 Crayfish for fishing 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.360
 Because I bought to Surume 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.620
 Crayfish fishing Let's leave for a moment 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.380
 I would like to go fishing 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.000
 This is also 100 average 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.980
 In NHK education 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.600
 A cycle of water creatures 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.420
 Medaka or Genglow crawfish Amembo or 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.900
 The times are 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.420
 There is a memory I saw without never miss it 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.240
 So I will rebroadcast it again 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.300
 I have always seen www 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.960
 Something in the water is exciting. 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.320
 OK Let's try this 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.920
 By 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 Caught caught caught ... 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.820
 I was caught 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.580
 It is a real wild medaka 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 this 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.140
 Let's pick it up with a little bigger one 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.440
 captured 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 Ho ho ho ... 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.120
 Did you get in? 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.160
 Porridge 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.880
 You see it 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.240
 this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.440
 Hey there 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.920
 OK OK OK ... 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.940
 Very hard thing 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.320
 Oboe www 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.680
 I missed another one 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.220
 really 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640
 I wonder if it is only this 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.160
 I have no more 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.700
 I'm fine 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.460
 Crayfish don't catch very much 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.160
 It came to be able to catch quite easily 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.460
 got used to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.900
 Ota Tadashi 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.140
 www 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 Tadpoles www 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.800
 I also caught the tadpole 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.580
 But I still have neither legs nor hands 

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.800
 Don't you have your hands growing first? Do your feet grow first? 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.300
 I do not have any more 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.760
 catch! 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.680
 Not in 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.640
 I was caught 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.520
 Maybe 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.140
 Yup 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.200
 Yes increased 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.000

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.380
 Great 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.900
 Great www 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.060
 He's dead kidding 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.880
 I remembered when I was a child, though 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.480
 It has not changed this way for more than 20 years now 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.640
 I'm glad I have a living thing 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.640
 After that crayfish 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.680
 Zari ... 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.800
 There is no Zari 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.500
 Yes yeah 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.700
 This time 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.920
 Medaka fishing 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.060
 It would have been nice to have a crayfish, but I could not get a crayfish again 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.940
 Medaka because of that 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.840
 Seven or eight were taken 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.580
 www 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 It was interesting again 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.400
 Well then 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 Return to the original river 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.540
 thanks 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.480
 OK 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.420
