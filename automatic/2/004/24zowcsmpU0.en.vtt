can<00:01:47.009> go<00:01:47.159> ahead<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.390> your

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
can go ahead and put it on your

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.179 
can go ahead and put it on your
application<00:01:49.619> right<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.579> here

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
application right as you see here

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.190 
application right as you see here
let's<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.369> power<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> up

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
let's go power it up

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
let's go power it up
so<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> variety<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.189> trigger<00:01:56.490> wires<00:01:56.700> on

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
so with that variety of trigger wires on

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.870 
so with that variety of trigger wires on
the<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> fixture<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.520> nice<00:01:59.520> thing

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the back of the fixture and nice thing

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660 
the back of the fixture and nice thing
that<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.600> able<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.320> done<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that is able to be done with this is the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.690 
that is able to be done with this is the
warning<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.140> illumination<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.460> be

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
warning and the illumination can be

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.809 
warning and the illumination can be
isolated<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.600> another

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
isolated from one another

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.990 
isolated from one another
so<00:02:08.819> again<00:02:10.310> there<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> move

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so again there you have it going to move

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.760 
so again there you have it going to move
around<00:02:12.120> here<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.020> studio<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
around here in the studio and you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
around here in the studio and you
see<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> off-axis<00:02:14.780> aspect<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.900> this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
see the off-axis aspect of this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.250 
see the off-axis aspect of this
particular<00:02:16.290> light<00:02:16.650> which<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.980> very<00:02:17.010> nice<00:02:18.260> very

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
particular light which is very nice very

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290 
particular light which is very nice very
positive<00:02:19.800> multiple<00:02:20.550> flash<00:02:20.760> patterns<00:02:21.210> of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
positive multiple flash patterns of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.540 
positive multiple flash patterns of
course<00:02:21.480> are<00:02:21.720> available<00:02:22.040> they<00:02:23.040> are<00:02:23.070> indeed

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
course are available they are indeed

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.110 
course are available they are indeed
there<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> total<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.900> 21<00:02:25.670> let's<00:02:26.670> turn<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
there is a total of 21 let's turn on the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.150 
there is a total of 21 let's turn on the
lower<00:02:27.300> illumination<00:02:30.320> yep<00:02:31.320> you're<00:02:31.890> taller

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
lower illumination yep you're taller

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.030 
lower illumination yep you're taller
than<00:02:32.250> me<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:33.060> gonna<00:02:33.210> lift<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
than me I'm gonna lift like that and you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.360 
than me I'm gonna lift like that and you
can<00:02:35.250> see<00:02:36.080> nice<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.320> bright<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.190> is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
can see nice and bright so it is

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.600 
can see nice and bright so it is
designed<00:02:38.820> with<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.570> gradient<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.860> it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
designed with a gradient in that it

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.540 
designed with a gradient in that it
casts<00:02:42.060> outward<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.810> downward<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.160> since<00:02:44.400> it's

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
casts outward and downward so since it's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.000 
casts outward and downward so since it's

white does not have a flash powder it's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.390 
white does not have a flash powder it's
just<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.570> simple<00:02:57.990> steady<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.130> if<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.280> can

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
just a simple steady on and if we can

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.520 
just a simple steady on and if we can
turn<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.640> off<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> quick<00:02:59.970> second<00:03:00.390> get<00:03:01.380> my

turn it off for a quick second get my
iris<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.950> work<00:03:02.100> let's<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> close-up

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
iris to work let's have the close-up

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.210 
iris to work let's have the close-up
camera<00:03:03.660> come<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.560> tight<00:03:04.830> if<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.070> can

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
camera come in really tight if we can

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.850 
camera come in really tight if we can
get<00:03:05.370> them<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.520> do<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.990> see<00:03:07.350> here

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
get them to do that and you can see here

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.450 
get them to do that and you can see here
how<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.970> diodes<00:03:09.900> are<00:03:10.170> mounted<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
how the diodes are mounted in the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.270 
how the diodes are mounted in the
reflector<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.710> as<00:03:13.710> you<00:03:13.800> can<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.130> moving

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
reflector and as you can see it's moving

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.670 
reflector and as you can see it's moving
along<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.820> side<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.450> lifts<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.320> then

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
along the side then it lifts up and then

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.250 
along the side then it lifts up and then
right<00:03:16.890> up<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> top<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:17.670> all<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.570> area
