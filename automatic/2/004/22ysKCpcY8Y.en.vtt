see<00:00:48.450> how<00:00:48.870> pressure-sensitive<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.920> screen<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
see how pressure-sensitive the screen is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.029 
see how pressure-sensitive the screen is
this<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.090> lightly<00:00:51.530> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> tapping

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this is me just lightly kind of tapping

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.479 
this is me just lightly kind of tapping
the<00:00:53.100> screen<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.550> pen<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.750> me

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
the screen with my pen and this is me

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
the screen with my pen and this is me
more<00:00:56.489> aggressively<00:00:57.030> drawing<00:00:57.629> thicker<00:00:57.840> lines

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
more aggressively drawing thicker lines

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.709 
more aggressively drawing thicker lines
so<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.489> reactive<00:00:59.789> pressure<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so it's very reactive pressure which a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.619 
so it's very reactive pressure which a
lot<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> artists<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.730> very<00:01:02.730> responsive

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
lot of artists will like very responsive

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.620 
lot of artists will like very responsive
to<00:01:03.660> touch<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.820> supports<00:01:05.820> multi-touch<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to touch if I supports multi-touch so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
to touch if I supports multi-touch so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
when I need to rotate the screen zoom in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
when I need to rotate the screen zoom in
to<00:01:09.299> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> draw<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.380> finer<00:01:10.590> details<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.250> my
