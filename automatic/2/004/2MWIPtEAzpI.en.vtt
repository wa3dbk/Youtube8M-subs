right

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:20.360 

you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.980 

so<00:01:20.880> you're<00:01:21.000> gonna<00:01:21.090> watch<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.420> switch<00:01:21.720> right

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so you're gonna watch that switch right

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.700 
so you're gonna watch that switch right
gee

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.080 

GG

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
GG

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.910 
GG
so<00:01:31.689> you<00:01:31.780> see<00:01:31.899> i'm<00:01:32.020> doing<00:01:32.259> down<00:01:32.439> strokes<00:01:32.740> on

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
so you see i'm doing down strokes on

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
so you see i'm doing down strokes on
that<00:01:33.100> d<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.520> e

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that d to the e

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:51.340 
that d to the e
Oh<00:01:35.420> down<00:01:36.420> down<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:38.130> up

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.210 

so<00:01:52.350> guess<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.650> that's<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> strumming

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
so guess what that's the strumming

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.710 
so guess what that's the strumming
pattern<00:01:53.460> through<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> entire<00:01:54.030> song<00:01:54.420> right

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
pattern through the entire song right

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
pattern through the entire song right
and<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:54.930> only<00:01:55.110> thing<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.650> changes<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and the only thing that changes is in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.570 
and the only thing that changes is in
the<00:01:56.580> chorus<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.750> course<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.170> doing

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.820 

and<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.670> would<00:02:06.820> do<00:02:06.910> an<00:02:07.000> e-minor<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.830> ok

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
and I would do an e-minor on that ok

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.540 
and I would do an e-minor on that ok
goony<00:02:09.670> miner<00:02:09.940> 02<00:02:10.800> 2000<00:02:11.800> when<00:02:12.040> he<00:02:12.100> plays<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
goony miner 02 2000 when he plays the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.960 
goony miner 02 2000 when he plays the
song

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
song

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.760 
song
just<00:02:14.330> fits<00:02:14.600> right<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:15.230> better<00:02:15.470> than<00:02:15.560> I
