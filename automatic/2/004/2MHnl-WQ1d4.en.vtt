00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.440
 to 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 asked where is the matrix to not 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.360
 have plan that could be used another 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.360
 time 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:36.120
 the both dirty can be reused and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.829
 so he asked me, I started 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.679
 investigate and discover that water 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.679
 if you can start to use it again 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.870
 hi friends i 'm il and today at the minute 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.189
 accompany me to know how to 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:15.580
 invest if we are going to clean the water to 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:19.270
 conserve effort cleans dirty water 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.450
 to use it in their factories that water that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.360
 it is not clean it is known as waters 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.539
 Black is full of all our 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.590
 waste between the water of the true 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.229
 of the crusaders in the kitchen in short is 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 the water that goes away we're all going to 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 stay 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.280
 the first step is to mount the water that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.630
 we use in the city in large pools 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.630
 totally squares 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.090
 better pass some equipment where someone 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.869
 he had full of holes in there he takes off 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.640
 trash like martÃ­nez and plastic these 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.429
 teams are like a big queue in the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 next step signs that support this 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.180
 full glass of which we are selective that 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.470
 we can only see them through the microscope 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.769
 They know who we are, of course I'm talking 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.350
 of microorganisms is about 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.989
 hungry microorganisms that live in 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.170
 a very special way and they feed on the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:38.170
 rest of food that water and our 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.170
 organism 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.410
 when the water reaches the circular tank 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.750
 they call it clarifier we do not 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.300
 answer 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.680
 week the point and the water that remains 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.650
 above 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.680
 and special products if they are already fixed 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.349
 that come clarita and when they leave 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 these special filters already last 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.840
 the water is hidden by a channel where 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.180
 there are ultraviolet light lamps 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.370
 This light helps us 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.389
 microorganisms that could remain 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.760
 still no longer reproduce as it happened 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:24.770
 all this process we have treated water 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.850
 it's an urban and for many things 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.850
 the water that cleans 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.069
 to drinking water 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.069
 people 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.939
 and depending on how you can 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.450
 like the lady 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.469
 how
