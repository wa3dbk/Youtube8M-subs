right<00:01:01.219> now<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.239> what<00:01:02.959> we<00:01:03.049> wanted<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.319> do<00:01:03.499> with

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
right now so what we wanted to do with

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.470 
right now so what we wanted to do with
this<00:01:03.799> make<00:01:04.100> sure<00:01:04.340> that<00:01:04.520> people<00:01:04.699> can<00:01:05.120> be<00:01:05.300> online

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
this make sure that people can be online

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.840 
this make sure that people can be online
with<00:01:05.960> their<00:01:06.140> phone<00:01:06.380> on<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.800> Internet<00:01:07.250> Anna

market<00:01:08.300> for<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.660> nomicon<00:01:08.960> for<00:01:09.410> an<00:01:09.530> iphone

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
market for the nomicon for an iphone

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.580 
market for the nomicon for an iphone
accounted<00:01:10.190> for<00:01:10.550> android<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.050> we<00:01:12.200> built<00:01:12.380> a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
accounted for android so we built a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.730 
accounted for android so we built a
system<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.520> show<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:14.060> html5<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.290> open<00:01:15.590> web

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
system to show that html5 and open web

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.460 
system to show that html5 and open web
technologies<00:01:16.370> can<00:01:16.910> actually<00:01:17.420> work<00:01:17.870> on<00:01:18.080> phones

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
technologies can actually work on phones

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.410 
technologies can actually work on phones
so<00:01:19.160> all<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.340> what<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.580> see<00:01:19.880> here<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.390> a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
so all of what you see here is like a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.970 
so all of what you see here is like a
website<00:01:20.870> so<00:01:21.110> if<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:21.290> build<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> website<00:01:21.740> and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
website so if you build a website and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.530 
website so if you build a website and
know<00:01:22.160> how<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.310> go<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.640> website<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.240> can

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
know how to go to the website you can

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.000 
know how to go to the website you can
build<00:01:23.690> an<00:01:23.750> application<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.830> don't

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
build an application for that you don't

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.740 
build an application for that you don't
have<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.160> learn<00:01:25.400> any<00:01:25.700> new<00:01:25.760> technologies<00:01:26.510> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
have to learn any new technologies and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.110 
have to learn any new technologies and
that<00:01:27.680> way<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:27.920> can<00:01:28.160> ship<00:01:28.370> out<00:01:28.490> gang<00:01:28.760> ship<00:01:28.970> out

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
that way you can ship out gang ship out

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.850 
that way you can ship out gang ship out
your<00:01:29.150> system<00:01:29.510> this<00:01:29.900> for<00:01:30.110> example<00:01:30.290> laughs<00:01:30.710> that

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
your system this for example laughs that

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.110 
your system this for example laughs that
I've<00:01:30.950> written<00:01:31.070> for<00:01:31.280> myself<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.730> compare<00:01:32.030> the
