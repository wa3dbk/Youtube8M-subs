00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.799
 So the next problem that we still have 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.570
 can not hold that is 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.940
 that can be different 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.189
 cause 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:25.649
 First, as always , we look that 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:28.750
 Everything is pending go the power plug 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:33.640
 and make sure that the faucet 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.820
 Every washing machine is turned off 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.510
 somewhere mostly far below right or 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 left a flap which we open now 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:49.780
 once and behind it hides 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.239
 usually a hose something with the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.200
 man can open the door if necessary and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.460
 a sieve if something else 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.700
 machine should be that now 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.439
 let go first 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.450
 We take a peel as well 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 these turn on this similar 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.070
 and so opens together drain hose 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.400
 goodbye is what I am 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 out 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 so the water is out now we can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.150
 in most models, the flap 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.150
 do it in the front 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 it works that way or according to my mechanism 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:50.159
 Just look then we need 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 a rag we lay glad the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 opening of the lint and then 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 let's turn that thing out of the box 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.009
 Basic is now seen already well 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.229
 There is still water there 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.170
 again have no rag under then 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.459
 hopes to construct everything 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.709
 with this model it is so that me 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.140
 no direct game but 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 a closure because that ensures that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 no major items in the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.810
 come points 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.340
 if we find anything again 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.590
 we will see already get cent 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.890
 Pieces of hair clips or similar out 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.370
 that one then removes and unscrews that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.370
 you again 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.190
 then make a hose again 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.190
 to 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.720
 and now you could be the first 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.159
 trial run was the trial run 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.700
 So I can succeed 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.239
 be assembled 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.239
 the rag off 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 the hose is pushed back again 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.299
 shut up and ready
