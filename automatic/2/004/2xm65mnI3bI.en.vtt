00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hi everyone, which one of you is doing 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.340
 a snowman with me well this one is 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.740
 the video that deluqui inspired inspiration 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 by frozen ande I already did the hat 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
 tallinn house downstairs in case you want 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.300
 watch style that I will start with a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.250
 base which is a champagne a shade 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.350
 creamy indeed the help of a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.699
 luminescence throughout my eyelid and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.340
 make a little more big river too 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.500
 the colors I'm going to put next and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.689
 on my 88 color palette matita 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 pigozzi I chose already had passed my 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 illuminator that is a skin tone or 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 It's true that the two shades lighter than 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.540
 my skin and so I'm going to give a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 painter in my look and I put it on 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.030
 all my eyebrows and my 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 animal with an opaque shade of brown and my 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 blurry brush that weave brother john 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.899
 this was a thunder sorry if you hear 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 the thunder and quickly set the concave 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.750
 and with brown eyeliner I go 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.670
 outline quickly in one way 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 a little thicker in the outer corner 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 my upper lashes 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 I want to create a base for the shadow 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260
 that I'll put a little later 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.640
 strong 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.409
 how do you use a premium base? 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 easy on my smoking 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 I'll use the pencil on it too. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.939
 same pencil between my eyelashes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.380
 like the dark shadow and this 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.560
 here is a little bit of a glow 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.930
 metallic of my same palette I will 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970
 pressing on that line of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.920
 brown pencil I did what it was 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 obviously strengthen the color and that the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.180
 effect a bit more smoky sees one 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 setting in the outer corner of the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.840
 Ana, that's what I'm looking for 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.689
 and I also enjoyed it and did the same 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.400
 thing on the lower lashes to give a 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.500
 extra shine on my eyelid I 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.140
 I used a loose shadow and it is super 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.790
 shimmering her almost skin tone and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.079
 apply pressure throughout my 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.970
 mobile eyelid 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.590
 It is my goal to say that my 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.479
 eyes are big but anyway 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.549
 I have this external demarcation 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.140
 only without decreasing how it would be if 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.140
 would have marked by the concave 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.390
 there as the mayor said big eyes asks 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.560
 a little bit of beige pencil inside the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.330
 water line 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.620
 so here they are applying in the landscape 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.410
 no secrets here drawing very hard on 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.180
 followed by a liquid eyeliner 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.580
 you can use in gel if you 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.060
 to prefer is your preference in fact 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.560
 I'm going to mark just a little bit the line 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 of my upper eyelashes 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.110
 I practically back up just to leave the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.450
 line and be able to hide more 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.360
 false eyelashes now bend mine 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.420
 eyelashes apply the mask again 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 any ministry if it does not 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.600
 to know if he also grimaces by applying 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.090
 more that you do not see but I do everything 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.400
 world does is life 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.100
 eyelashes that I have chosen to use are 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 only a selection of outer corner 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.510
 well filled again I want the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.980
 highlight of the minc is to that point 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.760
 end of my eyebrow so 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.680
 tell 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.210
 the eyes really put large but 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.310
 with that legal definition 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.959
 I'm super to see a video of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.340
 false eyelashes I'm thinking of 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.670
 record today while the braga 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.320
 recording this narration but I chose 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.989
 a mother only what is ney that gives 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.520
 I banked my fort broke it's a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.770
 story but it can not break that's why 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.320
 that you see the guy with a tape 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.850
 but it has a coverage that is medium 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.010
 but it has a very natural finish 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.420
 on the skin unfortunately in the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.690
 duration of this 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.910
 She who disappointed me a little 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 inserted as corrective I will comply 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.950
 my dark circles and also any 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.989
 and I have already done a 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.940
 video above all showed 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.310
 who knows how to hide those children etc 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.350
 and I hope to remember playing there 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.350
 underneath, please, I forgot to forget 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.030
 To accept all this, you will use my 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.500
 after the author who after translucent 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.500
 pizza that gives extinct 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.239
 and I took the license to do some 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.980
 little sardines this is my black 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.769
 that you choose to outline the pink house 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.810
 also and I made a little sardines 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.609
 using my coach brush 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.410
 so I just used the brown tone and 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.870
 I delicately made the blotches on my 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.210
 skin and I mixed my finger with the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.210
 very smooth and subtle caresses fully 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.310
 optional of course it's just that Ana has 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.220
 sardines and hence the question of sardines 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 I thought it was an extra charm the boj will 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.820
 use a very vibrant rose shade 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.910
 to give that face that she 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.130
 It was not super tuned time to open 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.930
 the gates of the country but the whole castle and 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.220
 finally she is confident when she 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.639
 She decided to freeze everything ok she did not 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.050
 But then, and here I am. 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.729
 just giving a whimsical in my 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.800
 sardines soda not a small touch 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.580
 on my lips, I 'm already in the wig 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.380
 on the lips 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.949
 I used a lipstick to 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.229
 to mark feathers but flames in God I 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.270
 really knows this forgiveness but it's because 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.970
 As it is drawing I really prefer to have 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.919
 this definition and I also left mine 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.300
 lower lip a little larger than the 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.599
 my superior and only has a neat 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 In this there is agreement in the lapa is basically a 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.250
 color of the mouth and above in birds and 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.680
 I used a blog with a little more 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.270
 daring to give because you can see that 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.030
 has a brighter lip finish 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.229
 her in the photos and in the drawing and I 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.500
 I wanted this too 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.050
 and also does not take his sardine and that's it 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.060
 for makeup error let's go for the jump 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.820
 I made the first lot that had road 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.970
 Coronation so I have the shades of green 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.919
 and black and gold is to use a steed ii 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.250
 next to my skirt because it's 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.770
 thing and the mesca and the body of the 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.849
 Her dress was pretty fair so I 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.099
 I thought it was a good excuse to 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.409
 take a course and the closet and I also 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.789
 I have a rule of pearls because with 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.949
 wig can not do hairstyle 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.680
 it happens 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.240
 and the second is visual is inspired by what 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.610
 it already uses during most of the 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.080
 film that is to seek the elma after 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.750
 she runs away from haendel 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.000
 so I have a blue skirt to my 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.420
 blouse has several embroidery to pull 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.490
 all shades 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.080
 the rest of the year difficult and I also 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.000
 I have a turquoise scarf she 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.760
 Wore a sweater for me. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.950
 both with richarlyson and a cardigan 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.690
 honored very well and I put it on 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.440
 bamboo doll are few 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.450
 I love berets, thank you so much 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.490
 watch and do not forget to enjoy the bid 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.890

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.750

 A magical day, thanks for everything
