to<00:00:51.719> me<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.320> film<00:00:52.620> seems<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.309> jam-packed

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to me this film seems really jam-packed

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
to me this film seems really jam-packed
with<00:00:54.210> x-men<00:00:54.570> characters<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> could<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
with x-men characters but it could be

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
with x-men characters but it could be
potentially<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> best<00:00:56.610> X<00:00:56.940> film<00:00:57.239> yet<00:00:57.570> I've

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
potentially the best X film yet I've

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
potentially the best X film yet I've
been<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.140> fan<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.620> newer<00:00:58.800> direction<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
been a fan of the newer direction that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
been a fan of the newer direction that
this<00:00:59.640> French<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.090> gone<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.170> love

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this French is gone and i really love

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
this French is gone and i really love
for<00:01:01.620> his<00:01:01.710> class<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.370> probably<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
for his class i think it's probably the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
for his class i think it's probably the
best<00:01:03.030> x-men<00:01:03.690> film<00:01:03.899> apart<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.500> x-men<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
best x-men film apart from like x-men to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
best x-men film apart from like x-men to
possibly<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> Oscar<00:01:07.140> Isaac<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
possibly and I think that Oscar Isaac is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
possibly and I think that Oscar Isaac is
a<00:01:07.590> great<00:01:07.950> actor<00:01:08.340> he<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.850> fantastic<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.570> ex

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
a great actor he was fantastic and ex

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.179 
a great actor he was fantastic and ex
machina<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.740> he'll<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.979> able<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
machina and I think he'll be able to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
machina and I think he'll be able to
pull<00:01:11.369> off<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.700> sinister<00:01:12.150> type<00:01:12.479> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
infinity war at the hand of Thanos we

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.360 
infinity war at the hand of Thanos we
don't<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.110> yet<00:02:13.349> but<00:02:13.620> possibly<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.340> could

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
don't know yet but possibly it could

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610 
don't know yet but possibly it could
also<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.420> funeral<00:02:15.810> could<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.080> flashback

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
also be the funeral could be a flashback

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.559 
also be the funeral could be a flashback
to<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.830> funeral<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.610> Starks<00:02:17.970> parents<00:02:18.420> or

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
to the funeral for Starks parents or

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.720 
to the funeral for Starks parents or
possibly<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.170> funeral<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.860> incident<00:02:20.459> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
possibly a funeral for the incident that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
possibly a funeral for the incident that
occurs<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.390> causes<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.019> civil<00:02:22.319> war<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
occurs that causes the civil war in the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.199 
occurs that causes the civil war in the
movie<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> guess<00:02:23.549> we'll<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.030> wait

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
movie I guess we'll just have to wait

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.479 
movie I guess we'll just have to wait
