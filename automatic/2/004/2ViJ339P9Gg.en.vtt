00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.000
 in the life 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.430
 we work with sugar this is very easy 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 delight is known this result in wine 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.480
 so we add sugar there and we're going to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.240
 mix sugar with games I have 2 eggs 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.550
 whole and 12 integers have in the recipe 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.460
 iván 2 buds that is two parts 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 yellow and the whole eggs of 24 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 hours later the guaranies in a cake 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.910
 oats or eat little guy thousands 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.489
 remember that these are these recipes for 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 share the account where they look 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.150
 Normally, if we eat, clean up 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.909
 protein a complex candidate after 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.400
 two or three hours the copious meal 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.970
 but if it's a livianita meal with 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.970
 simple carbohydrates 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.239
 after the movie 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.059
 a lot can be sleepy 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.540
 in general, you have to take into account 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.000
 account also that the alcoholic drink 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.040
 it also has an influence also 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.280
 within all this but without abusing 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.810
 I always have chocolate semiamargo this 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.930
 Belgian type melted know won type 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 school or unsweetened coconut and chocolate 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.050
 melted semi bitter 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:33.820
 70 percent and we mix well 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:35.720
 pioneer I love you so much slaves thanks 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 we add two ingredients plus two 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.000
 dry ingredients for a flour 4 040 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.560
 obviously scoop and a little bit of 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.869
 cocoa to reinforce the element in the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 it ends great then we add the 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.770
 flours of 40 if we are going to place 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.610
 also a little bit more cocoa powder 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.010
 to reinforce 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.970
 the amount of salt taste and color 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.970
 intense that we want 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.970
 but it is going to burn everything that is needed 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.310
 so much that we have molds here 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.020
 they are metal molds and what they do is 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.459
 they are bought from pastry and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.620
 what they do is lubricate well with a 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.180
 little butter or vegetable spray this 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.740
 yields plus or minus 5 to 6 servings 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.790
 depending on how sweet they are 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.959
 Silicone guests works also 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.959
 You can also use silicone 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 quite 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.500
 we load up to half more or less 45 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.180
 just centimeters come this high 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.170
 and we're going to take it to freeze or to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.170
 refrigerate 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.850
 if they have to leave it half an hour cold 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.710
 or if they want they can even do it today 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.090
 and they keep frozen so far 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.350
 they want to eat it and they can 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.350
 have frozen up to a month 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.170
 'we talk shrimp are stolen can you 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.430
 eat this aphrodisiac one hundred percent 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.420
 from the province to one hundred percent already 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.520
 we've talked about arginine 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.230
 mainly since also many 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.000
 Sometimes they are precursors I will explain 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.610
 this also from the nitric videos that 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.740
 is a true vasodilator at the same time 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.120
 same time also some fruits are 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.910
 as the case for example of watermelon 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.350
 rubén the white part the watermelon that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.590
 even called as a viagra 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.590
 natural 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.860
 but a little scrape no more encouragement not 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.320
 all the white part very well then 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.860
 we started this is very easy vegetable 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.860
 colorful 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.020
 the yellow brown reds the famous ones 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.270
 the costs the color they want even 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.270
 there are league and white delicious 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.630
 we also add a little brown 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.340
 greens and let's see garlic sauce that 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.830
 so much do you girls need 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.190
 they cook their unsafe diets that is being 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.750
 cutting unifying shortly, the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.880
 sauteed vegetables add 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.690
 shrimp inside are clean 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.540
 Peladitos is pretty sincere 2 so 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.620
 there is a good amount of 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.180
 we have some steps that are some rings 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.250
 of squid that would be the squid tube 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:41.550
 also cut like this into children who 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.550
 they have been cut they can buy the cuts 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.930
 add a pinch of saffron that I have 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.240
 they will have ground 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:01.810
 the saffron that is also saved very 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.520
 well something we know and what we're going to 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.470
 allocate this one minute a minute and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.300
 something important said also that a 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.340
 all the people seafood and we cook 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.470
 They have two types of pressures or cooking 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.330
 short of one minute and a half minutes 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.800
 longer function from the 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.800
 35 to 40 minutes 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:51.729
 we also have the peas 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:52.810

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.550
 We're going to give you a little bit of 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.889
 chives that is a baby onion

 fine green very delicious very delicate 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.229
 of a nice enough flavor 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.270
 they put you a pool of blues and the 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.189
 moment of the long diego controversy the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.900
 rice now if we talk about rice like 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.909
 a complex carbohydrate in this case the 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.039
 People who say many times can not 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.629
 eat rice at night that I will not eat 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.249
 the red that there were weight shares and I 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.930
 I tell you that that is a myth really 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:19.849
 can eat rice because everything is 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:22.999
 let's just say that the kitchens are and 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.529
 it was terrible we placed him for every part 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.749
 of scoop rice you place two 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.879
 parts of the kitchen 18 20 minutes and 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:31.180
 it is not necessary to place the oil nor 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.180
 butter 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:37.879
 we came with the we had taken to 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.729
 freezer I told them at least half an hour 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:44.289
 40 minutes and we 're going to cook it at 180 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.289
 degrees for 8 to 9 minutes 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.590
 in that hot moment you can 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.849
 reheat if it is not better than 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.310
 leave 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.870
