00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
have your CD players connected let's

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.460 
have your CD players connected let's
connect<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> amplifier<00:01:31.259> since<00:01:32.259> we're<00:01:32.439> using

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
connect the amplifier since we're using

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.899 
connect the amplifier since we're using
a<00:01:32.710> professional-grade<00:01:33.159> amplifier<00:01:33.729> we're

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
a professional-grade amplifier we're

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.559 
a professional-grade amplifier we're
going<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.090> use<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> balanced<00:01:34.780> XLR<00:01:35.079> output<00:01:36.569> I'm

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
going to use the balanced XLR output I'm

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:38.880 
going to use the balanced XLR output I'm
only<00:01:37.810> using<00:01:38.049> one<00:01:38.200> channel<00:01:38.649> because<00:01:38.799> we're

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
only using one channel because we're

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.800 
only using one channel because we're
going<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.069> be<00:01:39.189> running<00:01:39.340> in<00:01:39.520> mono<00:01:39.729> if<00:01:40.329> you're

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
going to be running in mono if you're

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.080 
going to be running in mono if you're
using<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.350> home<00:01:41.770> stereo<00:01:42.039> or<00:01:42.579> consumer

the<00:01:47.560> amplifier<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.840> make<00:01:49.959> sure

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
the amplifier you want to make sure

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.139 
the amplifier you want to make sure
before<00:01:50.319> you<00:01:50.530> make<00:01:50.770> your<00:01:50.799> connections<00:01:51.310> that

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
before you make your connections that

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.539 
before you make your connections that
your<00:01:52.390> gains<00:01:52.750> are<00:01:52.899> down<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:54.280> true<00:01:54.399> power

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
your gains are down and the true power

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:01.350 
your gains are down and the true power
