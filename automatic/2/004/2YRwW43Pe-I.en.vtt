what<00:00:10.150> we're<00:00:10.360> seeing<00:00:11.049> here<00:00:11.349> in<00:00:11.500> this<00:00:11.679> hole<00:00:11.950> is

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
what we're seeing here in this hole is

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.720 
what we're seeing here in this hole is
the<00:00:12.759> first<00:00:13.030> application<00:00:13.589> of<00:00:14.589> a<00:00:14.830> slot<00:00:15.160> system

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
the first application of a slot system

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.810 
the first application of a slot system
that<00:00:16.059> we<00:00:16.150> can<00:00:16.360> put<00:00:17.289> it<00:00:17.380> in<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.619> fall<00:00:17.859> we<00:00:18.789> can

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
that we can put it in the fall we can

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.490 
that we can put it in the fall we can
take<00:00:19.150> advantage<00:00:19.300> of<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.900> water<00:00:20.140> that's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
take advantage of the water that's

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.089 
take advantage of the water that's
falling<00:00:21.010> in<00:00:21.189> the<00:00:21.340> fall<00:00:21.580> or<00:00:21.970> winter<00:00:22.000> time<00:00:22.510> snows

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
falling in the fall or winter time snows

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.620 
falling in the fall or winter time snows
spring<00:00:24.099> rains<00:00:24.369> we're<00:00:24.970> taking<00:00:25.330> it<00:00:25.449> off<00:00:25.599> the

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
spring rains we're taking it off the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.509 
spring rains we're taking it off the
surface<00:00:25.990> putting<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.590> into<00:00:26.740> our<00:00:26.949> bank<00:00:27.250> and

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
surface putting it into our bank and

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.460 
surface putting it into our bank and
that's<00:00:27.699> what<00:00:27.880> we<00:00:28.000> call<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.269> this<00:00:28.960> type<00:00:29.199> of<00:00:29.230> a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
that's what we call a this type of a

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.620 
that's what we call a this type of a
tool<00:00:29.500> it's<00:00:29.949> a<00:00:30.039> key<00:00:30.279> it<00:00:30.580> opens<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.090> bank<00:00:31.330> up

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
tool it's a key it opens the bank up

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.140 
tool it's a key it opens the bank up
push<00:00:32.259> nutrition<00:00:32.800> extremely<00:00:33.520> deep<00:00:33.760> into<00:00:34.060> the

push nutrition extremely deep into the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.690 
push nutrition extremely deep into the
soil<00:00:34.450> so<00:00:34.630> as<00:00:34.930> we<00:00:35.140> see<00:00:35.380> on<00:00:35.530> this<00:00:35.680> farm<00:00:35.980> where

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
soil so as we see on this farm where

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.210 
soil so as we see on this farm where
it's<00:00:36.820> been<00:00:36.970> dry<00:00:37.270> all<00:00:37.450> summer<00:00:37.780> we<00:00:38.470> now<00:00:38.740> have<00:00:39.010> the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
it's been dry all summer we now have the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.760 
it's been dry all summer we now have the
capability<00:00:40.060> of<00:00:40.090> our<00:00:40.360> roots<00:00:40.690> four<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.290> five<00:00:41.530> to

capability of our roots four to five to
six<00:00:41.980> feet<00:00:42.220> deep<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.690> bank<00:00:44.050> they're<00:00:44.830> down

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
six feet deep into a bank they're down

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.240 
six feet deep into a bank they're down
there<00:00:45.400> drawing<00:00:45.730> water<00:00:46.120> very<00:00:46.540> freely<00:00:47.250> very

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
there drawing water very freely very

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.090 
there drawing water very freely very
little<00:00:48.610> damage<00:00:49.150> from<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:50.200> drought<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:50.770> far

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
little damage from the drought so far

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.160 
little damage from the drought so far
but<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:51.970> can<00:00:52.120> see<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.300> big<00:00:52.510> difference<00:00:52.540> where

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
but we can see a big difference where

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.780 
but we can see a big difference where
the<00:00:53.350> slots<00:00:53.620> were<00:00:53.830> put<00:00:54.040> in<00:00:54.220> where<00:00:54.580> they<00:00:54.730> were

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
the slots were put in where they were

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.420 
the slots were put in where they were
not<00:00:55.210> as<00:00:55.720> far<00:00:55.990> as<00:00:56.200> the<00:00:56.410> health<00:00:56.650> of<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.010> more

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
not as far as the health of the more

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.180 
not as far as the health of the more
leaves<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:58.690> roots<00:00:58.960> are<00:00:59.110> much<00:00:59.290> stronger<00:00:59.740> we

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
leaves the roots are much stronger we

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.490 
leaves the roots are much stronger we
have<00:01:00.400> so<00:01:00.730> virtually<00:01:01.240> no<00:01:01.450> wind<00:01:01.660> damage<00:01:02.170> on<00:01:02.380> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
have so virtually no wind damage on the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.860 
have so virtually no wind damage on the
side<00:01:02.710> where<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:02.980> slots<00:01:03.340> are<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.910> lot<00:01:04.510> of<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.750> on

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
side where the slots are a lot of it on

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.050 
side where the slots are a lot of it on
the<00:01:04.989> opposite<00:01:05.500> side<00:01:05.740> where<00:01:06.700> there<00:01:06.850> hasn't

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
the opposite side where there hasn't

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.670 
the opposite side where there hasn't
been<00:01:07.330> slaughtered<00:01:07.840> are<00:01:07.990> weaker<00:01:08.470> they're

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
been slaughtered are weaker they're

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.360 
been slaughtered are weaker they're
tipping<00:01:09.040> over

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
tipping over

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.850 
tipping over
but<00:01:10.180> above<00:01:10.420> all<00:01:10.660> when<00:01:11.140> we<00:01:11.260> look<00:01:11.290> at<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.650> girth

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
but above all when we look at the girth

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.860 
but above all when we look at the girth
of<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.100> ear<00:01:12.400> we're<00:01:12.820> finding<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.330> much<00:01:13.540> bigger

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
of the ear we're finding a much bigger

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.680 
of the ear we're finding a much bigger
looks<00:01:14.290> like<00:01:14.500> about<00:01:14.650> 2<00:01:15.070> more<00:01:15.460> rows<00:01:15.760> of<00:01:16.060> corn<00:01:16.390> on

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
looks like about 2 more rows of corn on

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.110 
looks like about 2 more rows of corn on
the<00:01:17.290> zone<00:01:17.620> door<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.980> slotted<00:01:18.460> side<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.000> on

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
the zone door the slotted side and on

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.450 
the zone door the slotted side and on
the<00:01:19.300> inside<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.080> hasn't<00:01:20.260> been<00:01:20.500> will

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the inside that hasn't been will

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.960 
the inside that hasn't been will
identify<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.900> deep<00:01:23.170> we<00:01:23.350> need<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.620> run<00:01:23.800> it<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
identify how deep we need to run it the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.330 
identify how deep we need to run it the
tool<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.390> then<00:01:25.600> run<00:01:25.840> through<00:01:26.410> this<00:01:26.650> or<00:01:27.010> below

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
tool is then run through this or below

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.040 
tool is then run through this or below
it<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.800> root<00:01:29.800> mass<00:01:30.870> eventually<00:01:31.870> will

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
it so that the root mass eventually will

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.960 
it so that the root mass eventually will
get<00:01:32.170> there<00:01:32.440> but<00:01:32.740> right<00:01:33.040> up<00:01:33.159> front<00:01:33.460> we<00:01:33.640> want<00:01:33.790> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
get there but right up front we want the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.160 
get there but right up front we want the
slots<00:01:34.240> put<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.290> we<00:01:35.470> can<00:01:35.909> accomplish

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
slots put in so that we can accomplish

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.640 
slots put in so that we can accomplish
water<00:01:38.170> retention<00:01:38.590> oxygen<00:01:39.550> development<00:01:40.150> in

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
bacteria and micro life they all use

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.860 
bacteria and micro life they all use
oxygen<00:01:43.479> also<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:45.190> if<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.520> only<00:01:45.729> have<00:01:46.030> enough

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
oxygen also and if we only have enough

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.990 
oxygen also and if we only have enough
oxygen<00:01:47.409> up<00:01:47.530> here<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:48.280> they<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.490> survive

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
oxygen up here that they can survive

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.080 
oxygen up here that they can survive
this<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:49.930> all<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.290> soil<00:01:50.500> we're<00:01:50.770> using<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:52.030> if

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
this is all the soil we're using so if

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.969 
this is all the soil we're using so if
we<00:01:52.210> can<00:01:52.360> simply<00:01:52.750> create<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.050> vehicle<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.710> start

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
we can simply create a vehicle to start

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.010 
we can simply create a vehicle to start
it<00:01:54.130> deeper<00:01:54.520> into<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.820> soil<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.810> bio

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
it deeper into the soil the bio

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.469 
it deeper into the soil the bio
digestion<00:01:56.560> system<00:01:56.979> grows<00:01:57.460> very<00:01:57.790> very<00:01:58.060> rapidly

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
digestion system grows very very rapidly

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.050 
digestion system grows very very rapidly
the<00:01:58.810> idea<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.440> there<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.430> potential<00:02:00.850> of

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
the idea is that there is a potential of

it's just drawn in lots and lots of

it's just drawn in lots and lots of

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.640 
nutrient rich then it takes more to do
that<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.639> we<00:03:37.790> found<00:03:38.120> again<00:03:38.569> in<00:03:38.810> years<00:03:39.560> and

that so we found again in years and

that so we found again in years and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
complicated at all about it it's just

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.920 
complicated at all about it it's just
something<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:53.150> made<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.359> lot<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.599> sense

something that it made a lot of sense

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.099 
something that it made a lot of sense
and<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:54.560> as<00:03:54.680> farmers<00:03:55.099> need<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.400> ask<00:03:55.579> what<00:03:55.970> if

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
and we as farmers need to ask what if

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.479 
and we as farmers need to ask what if
what<00:03:57.109> if<00:03:57.139> we<00:03:57.379> could<00:03:57.530> hold<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.919> water<00:03:58.159> where<00:03:58.459> it

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489
