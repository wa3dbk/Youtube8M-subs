board okay it's real simple now for
everybody<00:00:33.510> else<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.079> through

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
everybody else we're going to go through

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.600 
everybody else we're going to go through
some<00:00:34.290> maths<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.550> I'm

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
some maths or but you can see where I'm

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.810 
some maths or but you can see where I'm
coming<00:00:35.850> from<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.329> now<00:00:36.899> there<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.890> 24

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
coming from here now there there are 24

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 
coming from here now there there are 24
hours<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.329> day<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> each<00:00:40.469> barn<00:00:40.800> work

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
hours in the day and each barn work

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
hours in the day and each barn work
order<00:00:41.250> takes<00:00:41.489> four<00:00:41.760> hours<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:42.780> using

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
order takes four hours and so by using

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
order takes four hours and so by using
math<00:00:43.680> we're<00:00:44.430> able<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> come<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.940> with

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
math we're able to come out with

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
math we're able to come out with
obviously<00:00:45.510> six<00:00:45.780> workers<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.500> completed

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
obviously six workers can be completed

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920 
obviously six workers can be completed
each<00:00:47.010> day<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> seven<00:00:48.690> days<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
each day now out of the seven days of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
each day now out of the seven days of
the<00:00:48.989> week<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.469> 42<00:00:50.039> 42<00:00:50.730> work<00:00:50.969> orders<00:00:51.239> per

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the week so that's 42 42 work orders per

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
the week so that's 42 42 work orders per
week<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> capture<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
week now if you want to capture a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
week now if you want to capture a
hundred<00:00:53.430> beasts<00:00:53.610> it'll<00:00:54.030> probably<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.480> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
hundred beasts it'll probably take you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.650 
hundred beasts it'll probably take you
in<00:00:54.780> each<00:00:54.960> piece<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.590> work<00:00:55.800> order<00:00:56.660> it'll

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
in each piece is one work order it'll

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.000 
in each piece is one work order it'll
probably<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> about<00:00:58.230> an<00:00:58.379> hour<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
probably take you about an hour to do

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
probably take you about an hour to do
and<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> hundred<00:01:00.270> beasts<00:01:00.390> will<00:01:00.690> keep<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and so a hundred beasts will keep you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
and so a hundred beasts will keep you
keep<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:02.039> barn<00:01:02.280> busy<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.420> like

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
keep your your barn busy for about like

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
keep your your barn busy for about like
two<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> half<00:01:04.080> weeks<00:01:04.110> okay<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.949> each<00:01:05.610> day

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
two and a half weeks okay and each day

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
two and a half weeks okay and each day
like<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.299> say<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.840> savage<00:01:07.229> blood

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like let's say you get to savage blood

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.960 
like let's say you get to savage blood
because<00:01:07.740> Sam's<00:01:07.979> blood<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> guarantee

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
because Sam's blood is not a guarantee

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.460 
because Sam's blood is not a guarantee
it's<00:01:09.210> about<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> thirty<00:01:09.659> forty<00:01:10.020> percent<00:01:10.260> chance

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it's about a thirty forty percent chance

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.440 
it's about a thirty forty percent chance
and<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.770> chance<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.549> increased<00:01:12.060> whenever

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and that chance is increased whenever

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.510 
and that chance is increased whenever
you<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.200> follower<00:01:13.710> working<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.310> barn

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you have a follower working in your barn

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
you have a follower working in your barn
and<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.270> sure<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> follower

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and so make sure you do have a follower

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
and so make sure you do have a follower
working<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.650> barn<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:17.430> best<00:01:17.610> recommendation

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
working your barn my best recommendation

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.140 
working your barn my best recommendation
to<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> use<00:01:19.950> gold<00:01:20.820> main<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
Skinner and he's very easy to find I've
actually<00:01:22.860> showed<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> guys<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.729> the

video before now so suit to savage what
is<00:01:26.340> honestly<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:27.170> conservative<00:01:28.170> estimate

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
is honestly a very conservative estimate

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.960 
is honestly a very conservative estimate
you<00:01:28.740> probably<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.250> than<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
can see of course how this can kind of
build<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.930> whenever<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.469> more<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:58.710> one

character because you're going to be

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.580 
character because you're going to be
making<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.630> much<00:02:00.840> money<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.320> let's<00:02:01.500> say

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
making this much money like let's say

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
making this much money like let's say
you<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:02.909> 10<00:02:03.240> character<00:02:03.659> mind

you have a you have 10 character mind
that<00:02:04.380> won't<00:02:04.710> work<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:05.640> almost

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that won't work but you can make almost

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.999 
that won't work but you can make almost
like<00:02:06.390> almost<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.930> 10,000<00:02:07.590> gold<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.890> you're

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
like almost like 10,000 gold if you're

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.139 
like almost like 10,000 gold if you're
selling<00:02:08.310> these<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.550> pretty<00:02:08.759> high<00:02:08.910> price

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
selling these are pretty high price

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420 
selling these are pretty high price
every<00:02:09.479> single<00:02:09.660> day<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.140> you've<00:02:10.619> got<00:02:10.679> 10<00:02:11.069> alts

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
every single day if you've got 10 alts

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.890 
every single day if you've got 10 alts
that<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.640> barns<00:02:12.000> working<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.510> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that have barns working and so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.539 
that have barns working and so
this<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:13.829> efficient<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> do

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
this is really really efficient to do

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.130 
this is really really efficient to do
and<00:02:14.909> in<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.269> opinion<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:15.720> probably<00:02:15.959> one

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and in my opinion this is probably one

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.360 
and in my opinion this is probably one
of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> best<00:02:16.439> ways<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.829> making<00:02:17.129> money<00:02:17.159> right

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of the best ways of making money right

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.369 
of the best ways of making money right
now<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:18.239> course<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.689> is<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> huge<00:02:19.200> time

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
now of course this is a huge time

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.809 
now of course this is a huge time
investment<00:02:19.439> because<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.549> look<00:02:20.670> at

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
investment because you have to look at

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.399 
investment because you have to look at
you<00:02:20.939> know<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> time<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.689> take<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.170> level

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
you know the time that you take to level

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.009 
you know the time that you take to level
up<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.640> time<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.060> take<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.629> you

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
up the all the time that you take to you

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.050 
up the all the time that you take to you
know<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.260> pay<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.530> make<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.010> de<00:02:26.640> garrison

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
know like pay to make the de garrison

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.490 
know like pay to make the de garrison
because<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.329> global<00:02:27.659> level<00:02:27.930> three<00:02:28.170> years<00:02:28.349> an

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
because a global level three years an

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.619 
because a global level three years an
upgrade<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.280> ton<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.670> money<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.120> 5000

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
upgrade is a ton of money it's like 5000

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.149 
upgrade is a ton of money it's like 5000
gold<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.049> then<00:02:31.319> paying<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.799> bar<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
gold and then paying for the bar and

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.440 
gold and then paying for the bar and
everything<00:02:32.430> else<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.909> lot<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.239> work

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
everything else so it is a lot of work

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.210 
everything else so it is a lot of work
but<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.230> course<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.799> all<00:02:34.950> these<00:02:35.159> numbers

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
but of course like and all these numbers

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.550 
but of course like and all these numbers
are<00:02:36.000> multiplied<00:02:36.659> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.900> multiply<00:02:37.170> them<00:02:37.379> by

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
are multiplied you can multiply them by

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
are multiplied you can multiply them by
pretty<00:02:38.010> much<00:02:38.159> all<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.640> different<00:02:38.909> characters

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
pretty much all the different characters

are there required for a lot of
different<00:04:02.549> things<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:03.389> I<00:04:03.419> wouldn't

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
different things and so I wouldn't

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.899 
different things and so I wouldn't
really<00:04:03.870> see<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:04.590> demand<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:05.579> them<00:04:05.729> going

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
really see the demand for them going

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.969 
really see the demand for them going
away<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.500> definitely<00:04:07.680> going<00:04:07.919> to

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
away and so this is definitely going to

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.080 
away and so this is definitely going to
be<00:04:08.040> something<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.430> going<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.729> be<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:08.970> to

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
be something that's going to be here to

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.509 
be something that's going to be here to
stay<00:04:09.180> for<00:04:09.299> quite<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> while<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.290> also<00:04:11.159> after

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
stay for quite a while and also after

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.129 
stay for quite a while and also after
you<00:04:11.609> set<00:04:11.819> this<00:04:11.909> up<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.329> takes<00:04:12.540> very<00:04:12.599> minimal

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
you set this up it takes very minimal

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.890 
you set this up it takes very minimal
effort<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.709> kind<00:04:14.159> of<00:04:14.359> what<00:04:15.359> do<00:04:15.419> you<00:04:15.449> call<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.629> to

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
effort to kind of what do you call it to

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.360 
effort to kind of what do you call it to
kind<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.079> maintain<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.039> very<00:04:17.159> low

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
kind of maintain it and so it's very low

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.770 
kind of maintain it and so it's very low
maintenance<00:04:17.400> all<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.269> do<00:04:18.389> is<00:04:18.599> do

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
maintenance all you have to do is do

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.199 
maintenance all you have to do is do
about<00:04:18.989> an<00:04:19.169> hour's<00:04:19.769> worth<00:04:19.979> of<00:04:20.099> time<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:21.000> each

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
about an hour's worth of time on each

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.230 
about an hour's worth of time on each
character<00:04:21.690> for<00:04:21.989> about<00:04:22.729> four<00:04:23.729> about<00:04:23.849> every<00:04:24.090> two

obviously I'll show you guys on my
option<00:04:32.340> house<00:04:32.460> now<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.000> think<00:04:33.270> smaller<00:04:33.720> servers

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
option house now I think smaller servers

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.390 
option house now I think smaller servers
these<00:04:34.290> are<00:04:34.410> going<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.560> be<00:04:34.650> cheaper<00:04:35.040> just<00:04:35.280> by

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
these are going to be cheaper just by

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.370 
these are going to be cheaper just by
the<00:04:35.460> nature<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:36.660> what's<00:04:36.870> going<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.260> on

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
the nature of like what's going on on

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.770 
the nature of like what's going on on
smaller<00:04:37.620> servers<00:04:38.210> kel'thuzad<00:04:39.210> it's<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.630> pretty

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
smaller servers kel'thuzad it's a pretty

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.200 
smaller servers kel'thuzad it's a pretty
big<00:04:39.900> server<00:04:40.199> and<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.830> they're<00:04:40.979> just<00:04:41.130> under<00:04:41.430> 300

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
big server and so they're just under 300

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.450 
big server and so they're just under 300

big<00:05:29.520> time<00:05:29.850> commitment<00:05:30.000> here<00:05:30.450> but<00:05:30.870> it's<00:05:30.990> like

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
big time commitment here but it's like

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.240 
big time commitment here but it's like
you're<00:05:31.260> kind<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.470> like<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:31.979> like<00:05:32.100> you're

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
you're kind of like it's like you're

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.010 
you're kind of like it's like you're
investing<00:05:32.700> in<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.850> horse<00:05:33.090> like<00:05:33.360> I've<00:05:33.570> never<00:05:33.750> had

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
investing in a horse like I've never had

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.779 
investing in a horse like I've never had
a<00:05:34.050> horse<00:05:34.380> before<00:05:34.590> but<00:05:35.310> from<00:05:35.490> what<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:35.669> can

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
a horse before but from what I can

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.070 
a horse before but from what I can
understand<00:05:36.389> is<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.660> they're<00:05:36.900> very

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
understand is that they're very

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.659 
understand is that they're very
expensive<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.800> it's<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.100> real<00:05:38.280> pain<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
expensive and it's a real pain in the

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.909 
expensive and it's a real pain in the
ass<00:05:38.910> to<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.930> guess<00:05:40.080> like<00:05:40.110> make<00:05:40.470> them<00:05:40.650> into

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
ass to like I guess like make them into

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.920 
ass to like I guess like make them into
a<00:05:40.950> horse<00:05:41.280> but<00:05:41.820> whenever<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.240> have<00:05:42.479> the<00:05:42.539> horse

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
a horse but whenever you have the horse

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.040 
a horse but whenever you have the horse
it<00:05:43.620> does<00:05:44.220> a<00:05:44.250> lot<00:05:44.490> of<00:05:44.550> stuff<00:05:44.940> for<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.900> can

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
it does a lot of stuff for you you can

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.200 
it does a lot of stuff for you you can
sell<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.410> you<00:05:46.740> make<00:05:46.979> money<00:05:47.250> off<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.669> horse<00:05:47.880> all

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
sell it you make money off the horse all

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.150 
sell it you make money off the horse all
the<00:05:48.360> time<00:05:48.599> if<00:05:48.990> your<00:05:49.229> horse<00:05:49.410> is<00:05:49.470> doing<00:05:49.770> stuff

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
the time if your horse is doing stuff

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.680 
the time if your horse is doing stuff
for<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.669> so<00:05:51.060> what<00:05:51.210> you're<00:05:51.360> doing<00:05:51.389> is

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
for you and so what you're doing is

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.450 
for you and so what you're doing is
you're<00:05:51.750> making<00:05:52.169> that<00:05:52.380> each<00:05:52.590> barn<00:05:52.919> is<00:05:53.160> a<00:05:53.190> horse

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
you're making that each barn is a horse

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.300 
you're making that each barn is a horse
okay<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.270> so<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.870> more<00:05:55.020> horses<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.590> have<00:05:55.770> the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
okay and so the more horses you have the
