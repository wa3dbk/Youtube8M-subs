00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
so a nice little knife couple uh let's

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.930 
so a nice little knife couple uh let's
look<00:02:53.419> up<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.750> specs<00:02:53.959> on

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
look up the specs on

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.140 
look up the specs on
just<00:02:55.940> give<00:02:56.060> me<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.180> second

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.490 

this<00:02:59.750> knife<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:01.060> 3.4<00:03:02.060> ounces<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:05.200> blade<00:03:06.200> length

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
this knife is 3.4 ounces a blade length

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.119 
this knife is 3.4 ounces a blade length
is<00:03:06.829> two<00:03:07.159> point<00:03:07.459> nine<00:03:07.549> inches<00:03:08.829> closed<00:03:09.829> length

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
is two point nine inches closed length

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.190 
is two point nine inches closed length
is<00:03:10.459> 4<00:03:10.879> inches<00:03:10.909> I<00:03:11.540> think<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.840> looks<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.079> little

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
is 4 inches I think it looks a little

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.550 
is 4 inches I think it looks a little
shorter<00:03:12.620> than<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:13.390> resin<00:03:14.390> handles<00:03:14.840> s30v

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
shorter than that resin handles s30v

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.580 
shorter than that resin handles s30v
steel<00:03:16.239> let's<00:03:17.239> compare<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.230> couple<00:03:18.530> other

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
steel let's compare it to a couple other

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.789 
steel let's compare it to a couple other
popular<00:03:19.129> blades<00:03:19.450> first<00:03:20.450> we'll<00:03:20.750> close<00:03:21.439> it<00:03:21.500> up

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
popular blades first we'll close it up

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.050 
popular blades first we'll close it up
and<00:03:21.920> take<00:03:22.129> a<00:03:22.159> look<00:03:22.370> at<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:23.439> compare<00:03:24.439> it<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.769> a

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
and take a look at it compare it to a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.770 
and take a look at it compare it to a
spyderco<00:03:26.079> paramilitary<00:03:27.079> 2<00:03:28.599> everybody<00:03:29.599> knows

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
spyderco paramilitary 2 everybody knows

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.180 
spyderco paramilitary 2 everybody knows
that<00:03:29.810> knife<00:03:30.170> very<00:03:30.500> popular<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.709> we<00:03:33.709> angle<00:03:33.920> it

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
that knife very popular so we angle it

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.660 
that knife very popular so we angle it
up<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:34.519> my<00:03:34.700> camera<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.420> not<00:03:36.220> exactly<00:03:37.220> straight

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
up as my camera is not exactly straight

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.500 
up as my camera is not exactly straight
that<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.629> height<00:03:41.780> difference

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.600 

this<00:03:46.439> is<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> little<00:03:46.830> bit<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.069> chunky<00:03:47.430> knife

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
this is a little bit of a chunky knife

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.640 
this is a little bit of a chunky knife
because<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.030> got<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.330> assist<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.780> there<00:03:48.959> you

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
because it's got the assist in there you

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.500 
because it's got the assist in there you
know<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.189> scales<00:03:50.489> are<00:03:50.670> pretty<00:03:50.879> thick<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
know the scales are pretty thick on the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.080 
know the scales are pretty thick on the
brush<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.439> mean<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.540> those<00:03:54.540> are<00:03:54.569> those<00:03:54.840> two<00:03:56.090> also

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
brush I mean so those are those two also

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.479 
brush I mean so those are those two also
got<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.420> blur<00:03:57.659> which<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.140> pretty<00:03:59.129> close<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
got the blur which is pretty close to

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:07.720 
got the blur which is pretty close to
the<00:03:59.640> para<00:03:59.970> it's<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.239> little<00:04:00.420> bit<00:04:00.510> shorter

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.080 

thickness<00:04:08.599> on<00:04:08.810> that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
thickness on that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.790 
thickness on that
is<00:04:11.310> pretty<00:04:12.310> damn<00:04:13.000> close<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.810> little<00:04:14.680> bit

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
is pretty damn close a little bit

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.099 
is pretty damn close a little bit
thicker<00:04:15.099> on<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:16.120> marine<00:04:16.359> barrage<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:19.109> not

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
thicker on the marine barrage but not

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.790 
thicker on the marine barrage but not
bad<00:04:20.410> so

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.580 

so<00:04:27.460> that's<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:28.090> benchmade<00:04:28.569> rei<00:04:28.960> exclusive

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
so that's the benchmade rei exclusive

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.050 
so that's the benchmade rei exclusive
mini<00:04:29.860> barrage<00:04:30.159> I<00:04:30.520> don't<00:04:30.699> think<00:04:30.759> they've<00:04:31.030> been

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
mini barrage I don't think they've been

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.969 
mini barrage I don't think they've been
doing<00:04:31.449> it<00:04:31.569> for<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.870> while<00:04:31.930> now<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.379> think<00:04:32.620> they

doing it for a while now I think they

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.189 
doing it for a while now I think they
did<00:04:33.129> it<00:04:33.159> like<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.490> year<00:04:33.819> or<00:04:33.849> so<00:04:34.240> ago<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.840> then

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
did it like a year or so ago and then

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.779 
did it like a year or so ago and then
that's<00:04:35.770> when<00:04:36.190> they<00:04:36.669> were<00:04:36.729> finished<00:04:37.030> with<00:04:37.300> it

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
that's when they were finished with it

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.550 
that's when they were finished with it
awesome<00:04:39.789> little<00:04:39.940> knife<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:41.229> comes<00:04:41.680> with<00:04:42.039> a
