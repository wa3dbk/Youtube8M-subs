 hello here ileana pr1 like you here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.590
 I come today with a theme that at least 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.900
 all my friends ask me a lot 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.770
 If you've heard a lot of talk 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
 about whether there really are 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.030
 works in lines where you can work 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.710
 from your house and I come here to 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.390
 say yes to approximately 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.370
 I've been working for three months 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.140
 with this website that is called 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.360
 others 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.790
 where you can get work and 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.830
 work from home 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.940
 about three months ago, I know 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.680
 they announce a job to be able 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.020
 so I can continue my study and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.290
 finish my education 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.760
 through this process obviously 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.519
 I did not want to stop working because 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.469

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.210
 flexible schedule from my house I stumbled 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.850
 with this page called hotels 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.479
 before subscribing I looked for a lot 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.190
 information on this page and review and 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.259
 it was very nice on the page I decided 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.659
 subscribe enter and fill all the 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.539
 information has the whole application in 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:30.850
 this page you have to fill a 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:33.840
 profile in that profile you 're going to have all 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.150
 your work experience all your 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.450
 education 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.119
 to the things that you know how to do 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.590
 in which company these worked if it is 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.810
 worked and additional if you have done 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 Projects 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.880
 or something for other companies because you can 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.170
 also put it in the area where it did 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.730
 Portfolio to May fills all this well 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:04.670
 basilea is where it says greatest 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.170
 forgive me go where did find works 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 and there are several categories 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.310
 look at all the categories that exist 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.190
 within these categories well they go well 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.040
 and they are looking for the jobs that most 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.040
 attitude you like 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.730
 and fill out the application the first job 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.530
 is the hardest to get because the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.600
 person does not know who you are the person 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.850
 He does not know if he can trust you if he leaves 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.770
 to do the job well now the 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.569
 first it's going to be worse 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.299
 Y 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:48.480
 you have to compete with many people 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:52.599
 from other countries which money is worth 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.609
 much more than us for example there 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.159
 people so they work for a weight of 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:00.099
 now not all the time and you have to 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.200
 compete with that obviously I was not going to 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.969
 work to play the now so much 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.340
 I was filling applications that the 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:09.219
 third day of I had entered into this 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.909
 website and I came across a 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.560
 partner is called and arrive and then 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.769
 I decided to take the application full of 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.659
 application and then put a 9 dollars the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.760
 hour and they accept me and since then I am 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.609
 working for it at least my 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.969
 boss gives me to go to work between 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.650

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.090

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.099
