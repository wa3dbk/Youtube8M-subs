00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 and already we speak you are a star in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.719
 Shanghai and let's say something about his life in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.910
 shanghai good a star not so much I am 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.150
 I am one more player of the team that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.760
 try to provide and learn to the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 companions that I have and good and my day is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 it's like that of an ordinary person and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 current after training I like 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.449
 listen to music be with my family the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.630
 truth very quiet and let's say something 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.960
 about his trained or with Galician trova and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.000
 shared and with the team 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.020
 well with the team happy for the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.020
 moment that we are passing we are 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.170
 and improving what the team is 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.890
 We have very good figures, such as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.390
 10 days as anelka as drogba but what 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.880
 what we are doing best now is 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.220
 form a team already with the talent and 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.570
 experience they have to learn 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.159
 to be able to take advantage 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.120
 and then another thing if on your number is 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.500
 a number 10 and now of 37 and that 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 means 3 + 7 is 10 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.670
 and we know that in the national team 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.500
 in Colombia if you have the number 10 and that 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.930
 means 10 copada 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.970
 for me 10 is everything 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.190
 that I played my first game as 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.700
 professional I played with the 10 in the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.800
 selection of my country game with the 10 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.650
 then the truth is the first time 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.550
 game with this number use the 37 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.670
 because the 10 already had it is busy and 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.890
 I really wanted to respect him because I 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.170
 placed in the situation it 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.050
 that another player arrived with the 10 if 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.320
 it was me that they removed the 10 must 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.700
 be a very annoying and uncomfortable situation 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.909
 and that's why I grabbed the 37 and if the 37 is 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.459
 because 3 plus 7 gives 10 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.180
 that's why I looked for that number something 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.010
 that had to do with 10 but the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.170
 number that I like the most and with which 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.640
 I played all my life is with the 10 I hope 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.970
 at some point put me the 10 of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.970
 shanghai
