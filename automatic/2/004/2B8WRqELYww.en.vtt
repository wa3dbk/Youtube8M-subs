00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.620
 and Argentine motorsport champion in 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.630
 the new face of the choir like it's rs 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.480
 tell us what was the affirmation of 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.219
 commercial that was in the air for me 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.139
 it has been a brilliant experience it is not 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.480
 the first one that I have the possibility of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.760
 do this I had it in my head like 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.040
 something to do and good now towards the 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.530
 toyota people could fulfill this dream 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.070
 per second some way and I hope that 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.289
 people enjoy it 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.250
 it was difficult to film it because I'm pretty 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.739
 actor's paw but I had a great time 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.739
 It was a very nice experience to try it 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.960
 the car even a little while I did not try it 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.160
 I still tried it I know that from 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.680
 these days and will be for sale 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.790
 Toyota dealers and calculation 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.160
 that some race will be 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.780
 taking to show it and there 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.089
 I'm probably going to make contact with the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 auto but now just some 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.680
 see it but I have not tried it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.269
 following the champion in exercise of 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.510
 tc2000 this year has the new 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.010
 regulation tell us the new cars 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.479
 new floodings an engine over 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.970
 400 horsepower traction 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.320
 front a novel category in everything 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.460
 the world because yesterday nobody has 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.680
 front-wheel drive with so much power 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.110
 what differences does the toyota of this 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.630
 year compared to the previous year the car is 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.399
 although it is the same toyota as we say 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.360
 the increase in power is not less 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.580
 we passed an engine of 310 horses 430 and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.100
 for a front-wheel drive really is 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.530
 difficult there is a lot of engineering work 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.659
 behind to take advantage of this 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.390
 engine and that the power does not do not go 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.159
 skating not trying to pull 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.649
 well and take advantage of it 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.600
 from the side of the duct is very nice 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.490
 the car is harder to handle 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 because it gets much faster 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.270
 all the brakes and the car comes more in 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.920
 the air the pilot is more prone to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 make a mistake and then the system 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.750
 that has paddle shift with the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.090
 changes to the steering wheel also for 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.540
 Argentina is something new and this is very 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.490
 cute 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.900
 in the year he started with the right foot to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.000
 you in the first race but in the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.250
 second you had good sorry 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.560
 reliability problems that will go away 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.720
 correcting with the year running like this 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.040
 I was face side of the coin not in the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.650
 first has been very good with a 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.390
 victory and the second has been another 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.940
 victory for the team at the hand of 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.500
 warner but in my case I left I had 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.960
 even some principle of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.660
 fire of the car and luckily I could 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.300
 turn off and well I enjoyed the event not 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.530
 because it's been a party really 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.050
 be able to be in this good street 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.240
 airs without luck has not gone well but 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.690
 good thing about racing if you think 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.690
 in what follows
