00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.960
 mercedes officially introduced big 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 SUV update m. where 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.460
 the car has not only changed noticeably 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 outwardly well and changed the name now the name 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.260
 all crossovers and SUVs brand 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.760
 will begin with the Latin letter g and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.550
 three letters 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.079
 compact jackdaws after generation change 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 renamed to dlc 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.809
 and the big jel gls, well, ml or m-class 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 now called jewelry 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.690
 or as they say in russia 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.300
 last knee appeared in 2012 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 and externally updates on the terms completely 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.199
 corresponds to the planned large 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.390
 restyling the fact that in the same time mercedes 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.579
 decided to change and the name can be called 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 quite logical marketing move 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.079
 a few years old mercedes was looking for its 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.420
 designer style and judging by the latest 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.090
 To models, this search is now completed . 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.950
 washed rather k l i fully complies 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 new corporate style 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 and if at the time of the current 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 generation had i not liked in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.140
 first due frankly 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
 unsuccessful optics relevant rather for 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.820
 cheap Korean models than for 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.530
 solid SUV from mercedes well 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.600
 now everything fell into place 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.790
 updated crossover as it should be 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.310
 this Mercedes looks solid 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 convincing and at the same time modern 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.390
 powerful ribs on the bonnet 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 sidewalls are a complex form of optical 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.400
 items inside are now almond-shaped 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.829
 headlights and a huge three-beam star on 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.020
 radiator grille like this should 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.770
 look like a real SUV from 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.570
 mercedes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.369
 maybe someone will seem that in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 car exterior is not enough 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.180
 sports but 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.549
 but exactly this and sought designer for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 the sport now meets one platform 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.450
 and coupe 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.289
 a new day is solid quality 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 expensive and 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.270
 and obskazal monumental in my opinion 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.429
 status it is quite possible now 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.060
 compete with the more expensive big ones 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.069
 jel 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.200
 car interior is also noticeable 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.569
 changed what happened is difficult to name 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
 revolutionary changes but if 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.099
 take a closer look almost all the details 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.750
 Salon new appeared at the last 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.910
 automotive fashion suspended above 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 front panel monitor nozzle itil 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.200
 button actions and control washers 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.700
 on the same places but they are all different 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 even changed ru 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.440
 now have three-spoke of the more pronounced 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.780
 anatomical projections with larger 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 emblems in the center and below it is not perfect 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.830
 round this solution is applied in 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.900
 mostly on sports cars 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.099
 except external with the model happened 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.069
 quite a lot of technological 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.930
 changes but about engines trim levels 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.269
 electronic transmissions 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.970
 look in the second story at the new 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.829
 mer gl gl you can find the second part 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.829
