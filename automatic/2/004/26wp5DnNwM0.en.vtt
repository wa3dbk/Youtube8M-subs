massive stretch goal this go where I
can't<00:01:43.380> even<00:01:43.680> imagine<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.940> achieve<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
can't even imagine how I can achieve it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.860 
can't even imagine how I can achieve it
and<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:46.260> goal<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:47.010> earn<00:01:47.450> 40,000<00:01:48.450> pounds

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
and this goal was to earn 40,000 pounds

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.650 
and this goal was to earn 40,000 pounds
british<00:01:49.200> pounds<00:01:49.910> 40,000<00:01:50.910> pounds<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.210> month<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
british pounds 40,000 pounds a month and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.400 
british pounds 40,000 pounds a month and
so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.770> installed<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.910> September<00:01:54.660> 2005

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
so I installed this in September 2005

so I installed this in September 2005
and<00:01:55.650> I<00:01:56.070> started<00:01:56.400> programming<00:01:56.820> myself<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.960> my

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and I started programming myself on my

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530 
and I started programming myself on my
computer<00:01:58.560> screen<00:01:58.650> wassa<00:01:59.550> was<00:01:59.850> working<00:02:00.300> whilst

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
computer screen wassa was working whilst

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.540 
computer screen wassa was working whilst
I<00:02:00.660> was<00:02:00.690> answering<00:02:01.110> emails<00:02:01.920> wassa<00:02:02.190> was

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
I was answering emails wassa was

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.550 
I was answering emails wassa was
researching<00:02:03.300> Oh<00:02:03.630> being<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> intent<00:02:04.440> or

what<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.340> started<00:02:06.260> basically

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
what have you I started basically

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.520 
what have you I started basically
programming<00:02:08.010> myself<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.700> earn<00:02:09.530> 40,000

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
programming myself with I earn 40,000

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
flashed this i was getting programmed

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.630 
flashed this i was getting programmed
with<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.790> subliminal<00:02:24.600> message<00:02:25.020> about<00:02:25.709> 7,000

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
times a day so fast forward to january

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.160 
times a day so fast forward to january
2006<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.270> we're<00:02:30.480> about<00:02:30.630> four<00:02:30.959> months

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
2006 and now we're about four months

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.190 
2006 and now we're about four months
later<00:02:31.500> four<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:31.980> five<00:02:32.190> months<00:02:32.459> later<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.540> that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
later four or five months later and that

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.640 
later four or five months later and that
month<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.620> did<00:02:35.150> 43,000<00:02:36.150> pounds<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.570> sales<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
month I did 43,000 pounds in sales the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100 
month I did 43,000 pounds in sales the
last<00:02:37.950> three<00:02:38.310> thousand<00:02:38.850> pound<00:02:39.060> sale<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.720> didn't

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
last three thousand pound sale it didn't

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.540 
last three thousand pound sale it didn't
work<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.590> was<00:02:40.620> cancelled<00:02:41.190> or<00:02:41.280> what<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.519> you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
work it was cancelled or what have you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.420 
work it was cancelled or what have you
so<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.450> was<00:02:42.630> exactly<00:02:43.080> forty<00:02:43.890> thousand<00:02:44.400> pounds

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so it was exactly forty thousand pounds

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.509 
so it was exactly forty thousand pounds
this<00:02:44.730> was<00:02:44.940> September<00:02:45.480> 2006<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.650> started<00:02:47.370> using
