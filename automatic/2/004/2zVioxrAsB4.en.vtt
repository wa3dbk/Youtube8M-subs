going<00:00:49.109> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.320> our<00:00:49.440> culprit<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.589> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
going to be our culprit and this is the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.819 
going to be our culprit and this is the
spot<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.280> talking<00:00:53.519> about<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:54.149> here

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
spot that I'm talking about right here

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.669 
spot that I'm talking about right here
on<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.039> car<00:00:56.339> it's<00:00:57.300> already<00:00:57.659> got<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.899> outline<00:00:58.319> to

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
on my car it's already got an outline to

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.040 
on my car it's already got an outline to
where<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> diffuser<00:00:59.609> would<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.089> in<00:01:00.899> other

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
where a diffuser would be in other

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.100 
where a diffuser would be in other
countries<00:01:01.909> but<00:01:02.909> it's<00:01:03.210> painted<00:01:03.569> body<00:01:03.749> color

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
countries but it's painted body color

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.730 
countries but it's painted body color
here<00:01:04.440> it's<00:01:05.130> not<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.370> diffuser<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.150> any<00:01:06.330> kind<00:01:06.740> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
here it's not a diffuser of any kind so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.490 
here it's not a diffuser of any kind so
what<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:07.980> going<00:01:08.160> to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.210> ahead<00:01:09.300> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
what we're going to do is go ahead and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.470 
what we're going to do is go ahead and
color<00:01:10.500> match<00:01:10.800> it<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.580> plastidip<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
color match it with some plastidip and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.030 
color match it with some plastidip and
see<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.800> results<00:01:14.190> we<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:16.040> now

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
see what kind of results we can get now

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.100 
see what kind of results we can get now
the<00:01:17.100> hardest<00:01:17.460> part<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.120> project<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.690> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the hardest part in a project like this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.010 
the hardest part in a project like this
can<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:19.710> come<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.360> taping<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.870> off

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
can actually come in just taping it off

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.890 
can actually come in just taping it off
there's<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.100> curves<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there's a lot of curves back here and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
there's a lot of curves back here and
it's<00:01:25.380> hard<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> straight<00:01:26.040> piece<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> tape

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's hard for a straight piece of tape

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.900 
it's hard for a straight piece of tape
to<00:01:26.730> really<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.210> much<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> anything<00:01:31.910> straight

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
to really do much of anything straight

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.110 
to really do much of anything straight
lines<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.780> order<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.080> make<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.290> curve<00:01:35.120> multiple

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
lines in order to make a curve multiple

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.200 
lines in order to make a curve multiple
pieces<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.540> tape<00:01:36.870> just<00:01:37.530> slowly<00:01:38.000> go<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
pieces of tape just slowly go and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.320 
pieces of tape just slowly go and
straight<00:01:39.420> across<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:41.160> eventually<00:01:41.880> covering

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
straight across and eventually covering

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.700 
straight across and eventually covering
up<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> whole<00:01:42.900> curve<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.730> it<00:01:45.720> takes<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
up the whole curve and it takes time it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.710 
up the whole curve and it takes time it
takes<00:01:46.770> patience<00:01:47.580> but<00:01:48.650> for<00:01:49.650> someone<00:01:49.890> with

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
takes patience but for someone with

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
takes patience but for someone with
minimum<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.410> background<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.190> doing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
minimum you know background and doing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.960 
minimum you know background and doing
bodywork<00:01:54.200> I'm<00:01:55.200> taping<00:01:55.500> areas<00:01:56.130> curved<00:01:56.550> areas

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
bodywork I'm taping areas curved areas

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.450 
bodywork I'm taping areas curved areas
off<00:01:57.150> it's<00:01:57.510> really<00:01:58.440> not<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.620> hard<00:01:58.920> part<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.370> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
off it's really not a hard part of the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.050 
off it's really not a hard part of the
project<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.450> utilize<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.080> correctly<00:02:02.060> now

project if you utilize it correctly now
