 I have a YouTube tutorial kit for NIS 1,125 

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:48.000
 I have an e-mail marketing plan for NIS 1,750 

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.700
 I have a kit for rattling your business for NIS 2,252 

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.400

00:00:55.401 --> 00:01:00.771
 Here you will learn how to market on Facebook at NIS 3,250 

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:06.200
 I have 7 ways to sell and sell 4,252 shekels 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.174
 She gave Google $ 5,225, of course 

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.561
 The budget is limited, you know 

00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:18.600
 You can take part from here, either 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 It seems to me very important, even that seems important 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.000
 Package is a package 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.680

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.341
 And blogs, and study a winning newsletter 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.800

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.901
 It's excellent, it's just great 

00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:40.000
 It's all one package that includes everything, you have a complete solution for your business 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.013
 To me it sounds .. important things to rattle the business 

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:45.600
 Yes, wait, but 

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:51.700
 Listen, all together at NIS 14,255 budget ... oh ... + VAT 

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:55.500
 Listen Tal, we'll take it, it'll lie down 

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.807
 At most, if we also want to overcome all this stuff 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.300
 So we will only teach it and we will not implement it 

00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:03.626
 That's important, Michael, it's very important to learn one of the important things in this business to learn 

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:09.896
 This is very important, but we will not control it 

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:10.100
 Yes 

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.100
 I think no, thank you

 Thanks
