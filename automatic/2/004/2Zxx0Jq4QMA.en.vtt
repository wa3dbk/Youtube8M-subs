 judge fairly between man and his

 towards the little one like the big one you'll hear 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.739
 you will not fear any of them because the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.650
 judgment is of God and the cause that 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.120
 it would be difficult to bring them and I would 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.069

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.430
 desert that you have seen along the way 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.709

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.959
 to cádiz barnea 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.120
 Then I told you, you arrived to the mountain 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.909
 of love, which jehovah our god 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.730

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.890
 before you the earth rises and possesses the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.670
 as jehovah the god of your fathers has 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.250
 said do not fear or faint and gas to 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.409
 me all of you and you said send 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.389
 males in front of us that we 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.430
 recognize the earth and bring us 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.859

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.010
 of going up and of the cities where we have 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.530
 to arrive and the saying seemed good to me and 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.560
 I took twelve men of you one male 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.959
 by tribe and they went and went up 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.019
 mount and came to the winding of 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.120

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.060
 they took in their hands the fruit of the country 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.489
 and they brought it to us and they gave us an account and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.250
 they said the land is good that jehovah 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.950
 our god gives us in but you did not want 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.200
 and go up before you rebelled against the saying 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.060
 from jehovah to your god and murmur 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.489
 you are in your stores saying 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.550
 because jehovah hated us 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.590
 taken from the land of egypt 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.150
 give ourselves to the master of the crime 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.760

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.439
 where we climb our brothers have 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.230
 made our heart faint 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.480
 saying this town is higher and higher 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.789
