00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
stuff into this cloud so the cloud is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400 
stuff into this cloud so the cloud is
kind<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> ambiguous<00:00:59.570> it's<00:01:00.570> made<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
kind of ambiguous it's made to look that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
kind of ambiguous it's made to look that
way<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.640> kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> log<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.449> your

Trust at Verizon that that's going to be
fixed<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:16.709> going<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:16.950> happen

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
fixed and it's going to happen

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.479 
fixed and it's going to happen
automatically<00:04:17.820> okay<00:04:18.750> but<00:04:19.650> I'm<00:04:19.799> certainly<00:04:20.370> on

automatically okay but I'm certainly on

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.460

the Android device you set it and you

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
cloud up in the cloud it's kind of cool

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.100 
cloud up in the cloud it's kind of cool
because<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:29.110> doesn't<00:04:30.110> use<00:04:30.139> your<00:04:31.660> your<00:04:32.660> network

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
because it doesn't use your your network

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.110 
because it doesn't use your your network
bandwidth<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.889> waits<00:04:34.310> until<00:04:34.430> you're<00:04:34.729> on<00:04:34.820> Wi-Fi

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
bandwidth it waits until you're on Wi-Fi

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.909 
bandwidth it waits until you're on Wi-Fi
so<00:04:35.600> it's<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:35.900> going<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.169> use<00:04:36.290> your<00:04:36.440> cellular
