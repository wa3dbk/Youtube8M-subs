 painting carpentry gardening 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.400
 Doing odd jobs around your home is fun though 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.310
 not always without danger, because every year 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.610
 leads unsafe kisses to 120,000 levels 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.139
 and 41 people die it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.689
 party team of own house association 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 gives you some useful tips or 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.829
 to get started safely 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.089
 number 1 is the hobby break-off knife 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.460
 This can be a dangerous tool 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.789
 five are not too far away 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.130
 because your cutting power on the knife makes it possible 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.350
 break easily and therefore yourself 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.260
 seriously injuring is a good tip 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.989
 never cut towards you but always along 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 you off and when you're done I write 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.710
 with convictions 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.590
 Always wear safety glasses small 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.930
 splinters can be used during drilling 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.440
 milling or grinding easily in your eyes 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.440
 end up 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.850
 electrical work in your home that 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.440
 is work for the professional but allowed 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.730
 you still want to start so 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.990
 Always tension out in the 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.070
 meter box and as solar panels on your roof 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.870
 for a bit 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.480
 make sure that group is switched off 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.960
 and always use well insulated 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.960
 tool 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.010
 The ladder is also a classic concern 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.369
 the ladder is stable on a flat surface 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.950
 The one faÃ§ade is also the base 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.680
 do the theoretical or theoretical 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.990
 75 degrees and the trick is thereby 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.450
 go with your feet against the stair tree 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.820
 Stand up straight and make sure you are with both 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.600
 hands can grab stair trees and so climb 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.600
 safely up the ladder again 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.130
 when you are on top of the ladder 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.300
 so you can attach a string or so 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.210
 safe 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.100
 move your ladder on time overhangs 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.210
 the stairs are life threatening 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 and you lay down like this 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.720
 tom and don't let that worry you 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.920
 workplace has been cleaned up occasionally and until 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.020
