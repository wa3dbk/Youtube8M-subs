00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.280
 such an aviator I am still has a lot of time 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.840
 that's him 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.319
 Beitz Tablets 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.029
 the classic stays there 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.549
 he is one 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.779
 Of course, no other paper planes need it 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.809
 but it is also one of those paper clarify why important 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.390
 are known 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.300
 hold the fragments and soon it will be the 8th again 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.579
 Lend lease 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 until middle maturity 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.109
 to get off this tip and put it all down the line 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.600
 until almost routine 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
 I would feel like two fingers 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 Leave judge at court 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 if they like the leaf like this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.640
 this is suitable 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 the just folded back is here to offer life 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.580
 then he won 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.820
 so too 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.520
 and now I just have to top the ones down here 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.520
 survives to drive up 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.800
 and pretty 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.820
 Can I use the plane? 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 fold up behind 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 that means one has 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.650
 Here is a small triangle where the error was also thrown 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.020
 then it looks like this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.600
 on this plane 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.430
 Caries experiment with different wings largest 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 as usual, that is actually this one 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.150
 Pages you see here 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.490
 below 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.660
 means so 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.030
 and create and make sure that you up here 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 a nice tip came 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.450
 that too 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.650
 very fast to build the plane 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.870
 if you now down here this triangle what I have just shown so in the 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.850
 Hand takes 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.600
 then you should pay attention 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.900
 when dropping 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
 that the tiger has such a relationship 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.009
 Has position 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.109
 because the plane safely opens after the drop 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.349
 and then the wings should be as horizontal as possible 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.269
 that is, if you look at a player in principle 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.849
 and Verena is off 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.889
 you can already imagine 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.799
 when it opens in flight 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.310
 Kogan's wings down so there's nothing reasonable out there so always 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:31.189
 put attention 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.229
 if I push the plane together 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.999
 The wings should be slightly up so that it opens in the 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:37.709
 flight 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.229
 he can be a nice one 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.399
 has money nowadays 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.559
 have fun with the flash
