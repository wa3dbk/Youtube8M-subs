00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
take a look at that because this is a

solid stamp and I'm stamping it on a
larger<00:02:20.680> piece<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.830> where<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.950> go<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.340> right

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
larger piece and where to go it's right

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.810 
larger piece and where to go it's right
here<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:25.420> magic<00:02:25.900> trick<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> f<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.580> right

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
here a magic trick but the f is right

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.730 
here a magic trick but the f is right
here<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.150> since<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.810> had<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.230> much<00:02:29.380> space<00:02:29.680> you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
here and since you had so much space you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.860 
here and since you had so much space you
do<00:02:30.070> need<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.340> paper<00:02:30.580> cutter<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.480> cut<00:02:31.510> around

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
do need your paper cutter to cut around

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.520 
do need your paper cutter to cut around
it<00:02:33.360> when<00:02:34.360> you're<00:02:34.480> using<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.930> paper<00:02:35.110> cutter

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it when you're using the paper cutter

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.740 
it when you're using the paper cutter
it's<00:02:36.190> really<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.670> good<00:02:36.850> idea<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.360> take<00:02:37.570> that

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it's really a good idea to take that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.090 
it's really a good idea to take that
paper<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.260> bring<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.650> way<00:02:38.830> up<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.070> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
paper and bring it all the way up to the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740 
paper and bring it all the way up to the
top<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.580> ledge<00:02:39.850> because<00:02:40.150> then<00:02:40.450> it's<00:02:40.600> not

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
top of the ledge because then it's not

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.810 
top of the ledge because then it's not
going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.960> move<00:02:41.080> anywhere<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.770> opposed<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
going to move anywhere as opposed to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.490 
going to move anywhere as opposed to
putting<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.210> someplace<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.870> center<00:02:44.350> where

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
putting it someplace in the center where

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.800 
putting it someplace in the center where
there's<00:02:44.680> really<00:02:44.860> nothing<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.310> lean<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:45.810> slide

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
there's really nothing to lean on slide

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.070 
there's really nothing to lean on slide
that<00:02:46.990> all<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.350> way<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.680> top<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:48.870> put<00:02:49.870> that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
that all the way to the top and put that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.990 
that all the way to the top and put that
down<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:51.010> take<00:02:51.220> your<00:02:51.370> paper<00:02:51.580> cutter

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
down and just take your paper cutter

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.810 
down and just take your paper cutter
which<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> orange<00:02:52.960> blade<00:02:53.350> here<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.920> trim

out<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.090> letter<00:02:55.540> F<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.970> could<00:03:01.120> trim<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.450> out

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
out the letter F you could trim it out

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.150 
out the letter F you could trim it out
as<00:03:01.720> much<00:03:01.840> as<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.170> want<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.800> definitely

as much as you want to you definitely
want<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.340> make<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.610> smaller<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.330> it's<00:03:05.200> going<00:03:05.350> to

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
want to make it smaller so it's going to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.490 
want to make it smaller so it's going to
