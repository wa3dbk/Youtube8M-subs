00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
and it's a different seed right there

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.880 
and it's a different seed right there
because<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:21.020> minecraft<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.230> reinterprets

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because like minecraft or reinterprets

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.880 
because like minecraft or reinterprets
it<00:00:23.070> or<00:00:23.580> something<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.630> don't<00:00:25.560> really

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
it or something like that I don't really

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.790 
it or something like that I don't really
know<00:00:26.189> why<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.840> yeah<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.080> different<00:00:28.380> there

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
know why but yeah it's different there

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.870 
know why but yeah it's different there
but<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.310> still<00:00:29.730> Borderlands<00:00:30.539> 2<00:00:31.579> that<00:00:32.579> works

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
but it's still Borderlands 2 that works

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.840 
but it's still Borderlands 2 that works

alright<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.530> let's<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:44.539> just<00:00:45.539> fly<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
alright so let's see just fly over to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
alright so let's see just fly over to
the<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.090> coordinates<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.140> second<00:00:54.710> but

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the right coordinates one second but

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.369 
the right coordinates one second but
yeah<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.520> amazing<00:00:56.899> seed<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.469> I

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
yeah this is an amazing seed there is I

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
yeah this is an amazing seed there is I
think<00:01:01.379> six<00:01:03.799> villages<00:01:05.479> two<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.659> three<00:01:06.930> jungle

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
think six villages two or three jungle

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.100 
think six villages two or three jungle
biomes<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.360> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
biomes all right so it's right here but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
biomes all right so it's right here but
yeah<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.130> great<00:01:11.280> seed<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.030> play

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
yeah this is a really great seed to play

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.560 
yeah this is a really great seed to play
on<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.490> as<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:15.740> six<00:01:16.740> diamonds<00:01:17.570> six

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
on and as you can see six diamonds six

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
on and as you can see six diamonds six
diamonds<00:01:18.930> within<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.920> minute<00:01:21.200> not<00:01:22.200> even<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
diamonds within a minute not even you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.010 
diamonds within a minute not even you
could<00:01:23.280> probably<00:01:23.490> okay<00:01:24.150> maybe<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> minute<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
could probably okay maybe a minute in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.420 
could probably okay maybe a minute in
survival<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> could<00:01:25.920> probably<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.400> over

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
survival you could probably get over

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
survival you could probably get over
here<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:29.299> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.659> fly<00:01:30.930> around<00:01:31.079> some<00:01:31.560> more

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
here and if you fly around some more

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.340 
here and if you fly around some more
I<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:33.270> chest<00:01:33.630> has<00:01:34.579> some<00:01:35.579> obsidian<00:01:36.350> some

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I think one chest has some obsidian some

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.700 
I think one chest has some obsidian some
like<00:01:37.950> apples<00:01:38.990> iron<00:01:40.880> pickaxe<00:01:41.880> iron<00:01:42.659> sword<00:01:43.079> iron

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
like apples iron pickaxe iron sword iron

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
like apples iron pickaxe iron sword iron
full<00:01:44.610> armor<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.119> add<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.570> if

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
full armor and I think if you add it if

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.499 
full armor and I think if you add it if
you<00:01:48.869> got<00:01:48.990> every<00:01:49.409> chest<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.979> could<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.509> ten

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
you got every chest you could get ten

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.830 
you got every chest you could get ten
obsidian<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.619> enough<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.340> make

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.789 

to<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.729> enchanting<00:01:59.729> table<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:01.680> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
to make a enchanting table and then you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
to make a enchanting table and then you
could<00:02:01.979> enchant<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.549> pickaxe<00:02:02.790> after<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.750> get

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
could enchant a pickaxe after you get

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.100 
could enchant a pickaxe after you get
some<00:02:04.790> sugarcane

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
some sugarcane

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.540 
some sugarcane
so<00:02:07.110> yeah<00:02:07.320> I'll<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.500> fly<00:02:07.920> around<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.340> map<00:02:08.520> a
