00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.329
 the action 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.229
 that means zero in the seventeenth minute of the game 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.210
 the flank of Herr von igniter and then the ball somehow comes to Luiz Adriano 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.900
 the with overview 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.590
 and Jadson misses Boll. Dinamo Tor will not stand a third in the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 competition 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.450
 front is so brazilian to Witten defends the Eastern bloc 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 the defensive around the strong sinner Higgins the and wishes one reads in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.120
 the first half hardly anything and then they have to hunt for yes too 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.340
 still the national goalkeeper of Ukraine between the posts 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.090
 but now the match was under control but it was quite like the first leg 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.110
 weak game 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.360
 few chances to score a lot of fight 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.280
 The team can work well, "said Kiers shortly after the break 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 fast direct game and ultimately little bongo was 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.680
 completely free Button makes the surprising compensation 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.280
 so you have to play against this compact defense Justus 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.080
 and finally Bongo was the stand may be completely blank 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.780
 Pia peat 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.470
 without defense already 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.160
 and it got even thicker for Donetsk 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.100
 Intentional hand-play by Czechen HÃ¼bschmann 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.550
 who saw that would be the third yellow card in the competition 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.590
 He is thus locked for the final 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.700
 in the second half, the game was on a moderate level everything 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.910
 expected an extension then came the big show 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.510
 in front the staging 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.900
 the 2 2 1 in the 89 minute 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.940
 Donetsk sure the ticket for Christan Wulff 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 adjourned from twelve goals in July, the Brazilian have overtly scored 510 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620
 it is important to take care of them 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.970
 Schachtjor the better of two bad teams 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 but they have class single player and this unpredictability make them 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.549
 has so far
