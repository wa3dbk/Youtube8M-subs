00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.440
 well to cut this rope the only thing 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.540
 what they have to do is place the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 section they want to cut between their 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 feet and with the other end of the rope 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.290
 they're going to go under and they're going to do 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.369
 this at the same point they can do it 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.220
 with thicker strings 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.320
 just remember they put it between their 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.610
 feet with another rope 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.610
 at the same point 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.680
 and ready if you do not have an air pump 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.200
 to inflate your bed the only thing 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.800
 you need is a garbage bag in the 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.450
 bag 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.730
 of air 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 and thanks with a mouthpiece on the tip 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.059
 you have the mouthpiece that exists in the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.400
 bag with the mouthpiece of the bed in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.640
 key and repeat it until it starts 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.640
 the cause 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.880
 and seen that way is how to inflate a bed 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.500
 inflatable without the need of a pump well 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 all they need is a pvc tube 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 and your plugs here on the screen them 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.040
 I leave what they need and simply 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 let's make a hole in a room 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 inch more or less a little more with 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.370
 help from our drill and we have ready 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.590
 our unique bag dispenser 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.080
 what we need to do is take a bag 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.510
 place it in this way and fold the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.250
 half we take another bag we extend it 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.170
 we bend it in half and the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 we put in the end and we started it 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
 roll up 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.140
 remember that the FARC only 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.610
 handles 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.260
 and now we put it in the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.670
 inside of our pvc tube and 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.400
 we take the tip of the first bag that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.229
 we roll it up through the hole and 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.640
 we close and we have our 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.760
 dispenser the only thing they have to 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.659
 do is load the bag and they will have more 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.480
 bags 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.820
 you can see 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.440
 in a tube of this you can put up to 30 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.910
 bags more or less if they wish they can 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520
 use a wipes dispenser 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.710
 wet and you will fit more bags well 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.460
 all we need to do is take 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.910
 a crayon and with a lighter 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.270
 and start melting the tip of our 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.550
 container this candle can use 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.910
 in case you do not find candles in your 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 home 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.470
 let's not have the base with 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.739
 very careful and ready we have a candle 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.569
 that lasts about half an hour that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.000
 to draw almost perfect circles 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.610
 all they have to do is support 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.300
 this part of your hand in the center of the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.100
 sheet and gently rotate the sheet 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.230
 find the center and the size of the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.860
 circle and gently support your pencil or 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.110
 marker and they're going to have a circle like 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.240
 If they want to make it smaller they can 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.830
 use any of your other bones 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.920
 of the hand that I'm going to use this for 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.920
 example 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.470
 I will gently support 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.260
 a marker 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.060
 and for smaller ones they can use the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.989
 tip of your finger 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.989
 as support 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.219
 and ready they have almost perfect circles or 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.120
 can you use it to do some 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.120
 school work
