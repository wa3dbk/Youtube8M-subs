00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
reason you want to find an item that's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.530 
reason you want to find an item that's
roughly<00:00:34.380> around<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.040> price<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.059> glob<00:00:36.300> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
roughly around the price of a glob is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.060 
roughly around the price of a glob is
because<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.440> glob<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> ectoplasm

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
because if you get one glob of ectoplasm

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
because if you get one glob of ectoplasm
it<00:00:38.730> would<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:39.030> much<00:00:39.120> mean<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.629> make<00:00:39.870> your

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it would pretty much mean you make your

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
it would pretty much mean you make your
money<00:00:40.079> back<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> chance<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
money back and then you have a chance to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.540 
money back and then you have a chance to
get<00:00:42.210> three<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.899> salvaging<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.309> make

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
get three from salvaging so if you make

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
get three from salvaging so if you make
if<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.149> three<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.050> technically<00:00:46.530> double

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
if you get three you technically double

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.760 
if you get three you technically double
the<00:00:47.070> money<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.989> double<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.350> amount<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the money you double your amount of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
the money you double your amount of
money<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.430> no<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:51.030> would<00:00:51.719> pay<00:00:51.750> for

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
money because you no one would pay for

two would give you you know to it would
pay<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.760> additional<00:00:56.910> two<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
pay for an additional two you get the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
pay for an additional two you get the
point<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> how<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.170> works<00:00:58.350> anyway<00:00:59.160> once

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
point of how that works anyway once

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
point of how that works anyway once
salvaging<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> use<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.199> best

i<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.750> air<00:02:00.990> sigil<00:02:01.680> which<00:02:01.829> sells<00:02:02.100> for

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
i can get the air sigil which sells for

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.179 
i can get the air sigil which sells for
one<00:02:02.610> silver<00:02:03.119> 50<00:02:03.600> copper<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:04.710> another

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
one silver 50 copper pretty much another

it's all going to be random so it might

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.500 
it's all going to be random so it might
not<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.560> reliable<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.670> might<00:03:05.849> be<00:03:05.910> reliable

Masters I really would recommend you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.120 
Masters I really would recommend you
know<00:03:24.150> try<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.139> stay<00:03:25.230> away<00:03:25.560> from<00:03:25.590> doing<00:03:25.920> it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
know try to just stay away from doing it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.590 
know try to just stay away from doing it
but<00:03:26.609> it's<00:03:26.910> semi<00:03:27.870> reliable<00:03:28.380> method<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:30.329> that's
