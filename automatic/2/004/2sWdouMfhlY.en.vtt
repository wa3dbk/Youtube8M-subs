about this one is that you can also get

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600 
about this one is that you can also get
this<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> rare<00:00:55.890> fusion<00:00:56.219> rifle<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this as a rare fusion rifle that's a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
this as a rare fusion rifle that's a
blue<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
blue and when you do get it is that you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
blue and when you do get it is that you
can<00:00:58.410> upgrade<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.739> into<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.460> literary

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

can upgrade it into this the literary
one<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> imagine<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.600> blue<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.899> must<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
one so I imagine the blue one must be a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.330 
one so I imagine the blue one must be a
drop<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.530> Eric's<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.070> straight<00:01:02.309> out

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
drop because Eric's just straight out

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
drop because Eric's just straight out
gives<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> legend<00:01:03.090> new<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.629> means

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
gives you the legend new one which means

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.640 
gives you the legend new one which means
i<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.080> worry<00:01:04.229> about<00:01:04.290> messing<00:01:04.470> around

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.710 
world and take a look at it as you can
see<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.610> looks<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:21.000> damn<00:01:21.210> awesome<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
see it looks pretty damn awesome is a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.539 
see it looks pretty damn awesome is a
hive<00:01:21.960> weapon<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.799> looks<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.009> similar<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
hive weapon it looks very similar to the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.920 
hive weapon it looks very similar to the
necron<00:01:23.909> chasm<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> siege<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> slightly

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
necron chasm of the siege of slightly

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.420 
necron chasm of the siege of slightly
shorter<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.560> obviously<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> fusion<00:01:26.159> rifle

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
shorter and is obviously a fusion rifle

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
shorter and is obviously a fusion rifle
as<00:01:26.549> opposed<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.090> arc<00:01:27.240> damaged<00:01:27.479> auto<00:01:27.630> rifle

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
as opposed to an arc damaged auto rifle

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.660 
as opposed to an arc damaged auto rifle
what<00:01:28.560> makes<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.040> special<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> fact

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
what makes it so special is the fact

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
what makes it so special is the fact
that<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> has<00:01:30.240> two<00:01:30.540> elements<00:01:30.810> most<00:01:31.500> weapons

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that it has two elements most weapons

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
that it has two elements most weapons
are<00:01:31.920> either<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.220> kinetic<00:01:32.610> ie<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:33.030> don't

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
are either just kinetic ie they don't

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
are either just kinetic ie they don't
have<00:01:33.240> an<00:01:33.329> element<00:01:33.689> or<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.320> other<00:01:34.500> solar

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
have an element or they have other solar

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
have an element or they have other solar
void<00:01:35.220> auroch<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:35.939> never<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.299> more

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
void auroch but they never have more

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
void auroch but they never have more
than<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.290> allows<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.890> to

than one but this one allows you to

switch on the flight between arc damage

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
switch on the flight between arc damage
and<00:01:40.079> solar<00:01:40.530> damage<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.369> bring<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.579> my

a no select that jump into the world and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.880 
a no select that jump into the world and
then<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.479> shoot<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:54.750> academic<00:01:55.320> bullet

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.350 

and<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.010> I<00:01:59.070> switch<00:01:59.220> over<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> solar<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.120> I<00:02:00.150> can

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and if I switch over to solar then I can

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.390 
and if I switch over to solar then I can
do<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.650> notice<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.010> scope<00:02:02.220> in

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
do the same now you notice if I scope in

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.520 
do the same now you notice if I scope in
then<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> reticle<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.900> Oak<00:02:04.080> damage<00:02:04.380> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
then the reticle if I'm on Oak damage is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
then the reticle if I'm on Oak damage is
blue<00:02:04.800> but<00:02:05.190> if<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> scope<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.940> solar

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
blue but if I scope in one on a solar

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
blue but if I scope in one on a solar
the<00:02:06.600> reticle<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:06.990> orange<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.830> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the reticle is orange so that is one of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.230 
the reticle is orange so that is one of
the<00:02:07.920> indicating<00:02:08.340> factors<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.149> have

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
the indicating factors that's what have

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.820 
the indicating factors that's what have
charged<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> few<00:02:09.660> rifle<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.350> spine<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
charged the few rifle the spine of the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.990 
charged the few rifle the spine of the
gun<00:02:11.009> actually<00:02:11.370> starts<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> glow<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
gun actually starts to glow in that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.699 
gun actually starts to glow in that
color<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.660> I've<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:12.930> art<00:02:13.110> damage<00:02:13.380> again<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
color so if I've got art damage again it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
color so if I've got art damage again it
glows<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.980> blue<00:02:14.160> ever<00:02:14.820> go<00:02:15.000> inside<00:02:15.270> somewhere

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
glows in blue ever go inside somewhere

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.790 
glows in blue ever go inside somewhere
slightly<00:02:15.900> darker<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
slightly darker and you can see the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440 
slightly darker and you can see the
orange<00:02:17.040> butter<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.910> charged<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.240> soda

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
orange butter then if I charged the soda

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.640 
orange butter then if I charged the soda
one<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.110> orange<00:02:19.320> going<00:02:19.560> across

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
one you can see the orange going across

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.590 
one you can see the orange going across
the<00:02:19.830> spine<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.760> also<00:02:20.880> has<00:02:21.090> done<00:02:21.270> pretty<00:02:21.360> cool

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the spine it also has done pretty cool

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.790 
the spine it also has done pretty cool
sound<00:02:21.840> effects<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.260> when<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.440> fire<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.650> in

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
sound effects so when you fire it in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.590 
sound effects so when you fire it in
your<00:02:22.890> listen<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:27.060> sounds<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.270> bit<00:02:27.390> cooler

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
your listen to it it sounds a bit cooler

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.060 
your listen to it it sounds a bit cooler
than<00:02:27.720> most<00:02:27.870> other<00:02:28.050> fusion<00:02:28.230> rifles<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
than most other fusion rifles and the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.140 
than most other fusion rifles and the
other<00:02:29.190> thing<00:02:29.340> about<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.520> one<00:02:29.700> aside<00:02:30.090> from

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
other thing about this one aside from

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.979 
other thing about this one aside from
the<00:02:30.270> fact<00:02:30.300> you've<00:02:30.540> obviously<00:02:30.660> switch

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the fact you've obviously switch

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.780 
the fact you've obviously switch
elements<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.010> has<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.250> talent<00:02:32.459> called

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
elements is that it has a talent called

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.430 
elements is that it has a talent called
knee<00:02:33.150> pads<00:02:33.390> which<00:02:33.720> allows<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.200> slide

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
knee pads which allows you to slide

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
knee pads which allows you to slide
further<00:02:34.709> when<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.280> equipped<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> guess

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
further when this is equipped so I guess

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.070 
further when this is equipped so I guess
that<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.120> pretty<00:02:36.269> useful<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.660> crucible<00:02:36.989> when

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
that we pretty useful in crucible when

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that we pretty useful in crucible when
you<00:02:37.140> want<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.320> sort<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.530> slide<00:02:37.680> into<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.920> flag

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
you want to sort of slide into the flag

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.410 
you want to sort of slide into the flag
point<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.489> slide<00:02:38.730> towards<00:02:39.000> an<00:02:39.060> enemy<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.330> then

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
point or slide towards an enemy and then

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
point or slide towards an enemy and then
take<00:02:39.570> them<00:02:39.660> out<00:02:39.810> by<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.140> way<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.830> mamas

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
take them out by the way that is mamas

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.440 
take them out by the way that is mamas
so<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> only<00:02:41.970> other<00:02:42.060> thing<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.360> probably

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
so the only other thing is probably

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.120 
so the only other thing is probably
worth<00:02:42.690> mentioning<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.200> right<00:02:43.769> now<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
worth mentioning is that right now it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.320 
worth mentioning is that right now it
doesn't<00:02:44.160> appear<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> way<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.000> switch

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
doesn't appear there is a way to switch

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.820 
doesn't appear there is a way to switch
this<00:02:45.510> without<00:02:45.810> having<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.320> go<00:02:46.350> into<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> menu

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
this without having to go into the menu

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.810 
this without having to go into the menu
so<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.550> switch<00:02:47.730> between
