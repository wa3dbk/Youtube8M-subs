1.5 it adds a little bit more components

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.830 
1.5 it adds a little bit more components
to<00:03:18.840> make<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.110> faster<00:03:20.299> that's<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.510> only<00:03:21.720> reason

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
to make it faster that's the only reason

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.560 
to make it faster that's the only reason
why<00:03:22.110> they<00:03:22.140> mean<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.880> it's

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
why they mean it really I think and it's

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
why they mean it really I think and it's
like<00:03:30.950> depending<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.100> what<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.880> have<00:03:33.350> if<00:03:34.350> you
