00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.729
 for the joy of us text here is that jacko material is as if it is also us 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:07.300
 glitter blade 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.759
 first logo 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.860
 It's a way that you use when the brand you're not going yet 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:17.329
 and therefore not blessed cdata strength I love on the rope 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.749
 this is the key protection here 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.749
 with free end that is to the right 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.809
 I'm going to pursue mourning this way 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.840
 and then 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.670
 I ride it 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
 high within mourning is created 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.980
 I go stick extreme free dredger 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.320
 I take it all 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 emmett knocked down 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.230
 this is how we see el paterna who trusts 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.080
 create 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.090
 and that TV denounces the correct realization of the node 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.139
 so we pray for car covers 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.139
 and extreme book that hangs down 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.760
 this throttling 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.050
 on the left side 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.500
 this mode is convenient because it allows it to be loosened 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 the morning 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 extreme brandon free 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.080
 and this is the first node now we pass to the second node the second second way 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.290
 me is even more resistant first 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.280
 the file for how long it must be made for 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980
 takes a brand employee 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.870
 this time instead of 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.070
 to do so 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.460
 as was the previous market 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 I'm going too 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.760
 a wrap on the rope from the opposite side and I also go to some of your area 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.150
 an ostrich this maybe I can pull first 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.410
 the hammock 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.420
 make the throttle 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.640
 and therefore what to follow 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.990
 a first block 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.730
 of the cable 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.790
 now this asshole has allowed me 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.910
 relieve tension on the free end 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.290
 in which I can also play to create the first mourning 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.099
 which is worth inserting 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.209
 as if it were a vulgar way 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.679
 so far it would seem normal way 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:23.459
 the extreme free but commit ourselves again to create 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.759
 another 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.459
 node 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.019
 and this 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 then realizes 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.509
 the overall knot that is very durable 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.849
 but even this as the previous one allows it to be dissolved simply 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.089
 pulling 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.349
 extreme free sold 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.189
 for the record both for this way and for the previous market there is the 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.480
 possibility of achieving a security that I really like especially when I sleep 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:05.319
 in the extreme free hammock it is convenient that it goes side by side in the impact without 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.509
 take nothing 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.709
 just because in this way 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.219
 once 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.139
 it's a cautious wretch you go from loosening the way 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.159
 which is very difficult, however, because it is not a self-strict way 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.269
 riammette comes to block 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.559
 all 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.569
 the overall node and therefore it is impossible to fall from the mother this mi 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.169
 looks like a good thing 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.599
 it will mean that the next morning it will be more difficult to untie the knot though 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 better to fall to the ground 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.069
 this is the way it should simply suffice to give an extreme 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.939
 re dissolve it 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:44.519
 that's all
