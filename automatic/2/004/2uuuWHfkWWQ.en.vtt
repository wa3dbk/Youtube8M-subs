portfolio to build for school but mostly
it's<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:06.350> well<00:01:07.030> can<00:01:08.030> go<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:08.299> any<00:01:08.540> surface

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's just well can go on any surface

it's just well can go on any surface
really

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800

personally<00:01:30.260> with<00:01:30.440> burning<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:30.980> can<00:01:31.790> do<00:01:31.910> with

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
personally with burning I can do with

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.720 
personally with burning I can do with
bringing<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:33.020> what<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.350> isn't<00:01:34.220> he

whatever<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.750> choose<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:41.990> use<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.980> I<00:01:43.190> use<00:01:43.700> a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
whatever you choose to use and I use a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.000 
whatever you choose to use and I use a
whipper<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.390> used<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.260> wood<00:01:45.800> burner

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
whipper I used to have a wood burner

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.980 
whipper I used to have a wood burner
that<00:01:46.070> was<00:01:46.310> meant<00:01:46.640> for<00:01:46.730> it<00:01:46.940> but<00:01:47.120> it's<00:01:47.780> really

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
that was meant for it but it's really

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.050 
that was meant for it but it's really
weak<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:48.770> what<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:48.920> did<00:01:49.010> was<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.280> got<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:49.760> i<00:01:49.880> bought

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
weak so what I did was I got it i bought

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.780 
weak so what I did was I got it i bought
a<00:01:50.090> soldering<00:01:50.540> tool<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.110> then<00:01:52.100> plugging

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
a soldering tool and then plugging

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.940 
a soldering tool and then plugging
decided<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.630> i<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:53.960> would<00:01:54.170> burn<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.530> way<00:01:54.710> i

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
decided and i just would burn that way i

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.920 
decided and i just would burn that way i
should<00:01:55.190> use<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.730> even<00:01:55.970> i'm<00:01:56.270> from<00:01:56.570> my<00:01:56.720> auto

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
should use it even i'm from my auto

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.360 
should use it even i'm from my auto
glass<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.410> was<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.680> huge<00:01:57.860> soldering<00:01:58.280> gun

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
glass it was like a huge soldering gun

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.120 
glass it was like a huge soldering gun
and<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:59.540> problem<00:01:59.870> the<00:01:59.960> soldering<00:02:00.260> it<00:02:00.650> keeps

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
and the problem the soldering it keeps

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.700 
and the problem the soldering it keeps
up<00:02:01.370> in<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.610> branch<00:02:01.910> your<00:02:02.150> whole<00:02:02.360> handle<00:02:02.750> me<00:02:02.900> over

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
up in a branch your whole handle me over

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.910 
up in a branch your whole handle me over
time<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.340> i<00:02:04.580> understand<00:02:05.240> i<00:02:05.510> build<00:02:06.200> calluses<00:02:06.410> on

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
time so i understand i build calluses on

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.620 
time so i understand i build calluses on
my<00:02:06.950> hands<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.490> don't<00:02:07.729> realize<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.360> branding

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
my hands so I don't realize I'm branding

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.330 
my hands so I don't realize I'm branding
myself<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.170> choice<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.590> know<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:09.890> really
