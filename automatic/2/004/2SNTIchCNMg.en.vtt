them in these sessions is yes I
understand<00:00:41.010> where<00:00:41.309> you're<00:00:41.370> coming<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
understand where you're coming from and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
understand where you're coming from and
I<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> past<00:00:43.770> you've<00:00:44.460> had

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I know that in the past you've had

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.850 
I know that in the past you've had
difficulty<00:00:45.300> losing<00:00:45.450> weight<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
difficulty losing weight but we

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
difficulty losing weight but we
absolutely<00:00:47.149> have<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.390> change<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:49.410> mind

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
absolutely have to change your mind

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.939 
absolutely have to change your mind
pattern<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.550> order<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.750> lose<00:00:52.320> weight<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
pattern in order to lose weight in the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.540 
pattern in order to lose weight in the
future<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> can't<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.620> mindset<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
future so you can't have a mindset that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610 
future so you can't have a mindset that
I'm<00:00:57.120> overweight<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.809> overweight<00:00:58.289> I'm

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
I'm overweight I'm overweight I'm

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
I'm overweight I'm overweight I'm
overweight<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.430> be<00:01:00.090> able<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> lose<00:01:00.570> weight

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
overweight and be able to lose weight

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869 
overweight and be able to lose weight
because<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:01.859> paradoxical<00:01:02.670> they're

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
because they're paradoxical they're

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.160 
because they're paradoxical they're
opposites<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:05.510> create<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.750> three

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
opposites and so you create on three

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
opposites and so you create on three
different<00:01:07.409> levels<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.310> create<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.909> your

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
different levels you create with your

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
different levels you create with your
thoughts<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.080> create<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> say

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thoughts you create with what you say

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
thoughts you create with what you say
and<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.970> create<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> things<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and you create with the things that you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
and you create with the things that you
do<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.860> behavior<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.540> very

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
do in your behavior and so it's very

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
do in your behavior and so it's very
important<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.560> all<00:01:16.590> three<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> those<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
important to get all three of those in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.530 
important to get all three of those in
alignment<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> monitor<00:01:19.820> what<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
alignment you have to monitor what you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
alignment you have to monitor what you
think<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> monitor<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.280> say

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
think you have to monitor what you say

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
think you have to monitor what you say
would<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> monitor<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.049> at

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
would you have to monitor what you do at

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.880 
would you have to monitor what you do at
all<00:01:25.890> times<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.020> when<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.200> say<00:01:28.380> something

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
all times and when you say something

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that's out of alignment with what you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
that's out of alignment with what you
really<00:01:30.960> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> create<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.009> life<00:01:32.280> and
