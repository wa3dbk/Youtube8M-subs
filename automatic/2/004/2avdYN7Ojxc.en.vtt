00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
especially when I'm cooking because I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960 
especially when I'm cooking because I
don't<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.230> hair<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.890> my<00:00:23.310> food<00:00:23.609> when<00:00:23.820> I'm

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
cooking you know what I mean um and I

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.650 
cooking you know what I mean um and I
really<00:00:26.310> feel<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:27.000> though<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.420> hair<00:00:27.630> was

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
really feel as though if my hair was

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
really feel as though if my hair was
thicker<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.130> look<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.490> much<00:00:29.550> nicer

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
thicker it would look so much nicer

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.999 
thicker it would look so much nicer
because<00:00:30.269> thick<00:00:30.630> hair<00:00:30.869> means<00:00:31.080> thicker<00:00:31.410> bun<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because thick hair means thicker bun and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.979 
because thick hair means thicker bun and
thick<00:00:32.550> hair<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:33.120> means<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.450> bigger<00:00:33.690> braid

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
thick hair also means a bigger braid

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
thick hair also means a bigger braid
