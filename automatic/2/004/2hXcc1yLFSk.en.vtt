00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
isn't that pretty limiting their it's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
isn't that pretty limiting their it's
like<00:01:45.630> how<00:01:45.780> many<00:01:45.930> people<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> moto<00:01:46.680> G<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
like how many people have a moto G it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.170 
like how many people have a moto G it
seems<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.340> they're<00:01:47.490> gonna<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
seems like they're gonna have a really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.800 
seems like they're gonna have a really
puny<00:01:48.600> rollout<00:01:49.549> yeah<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> mean<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.360> could

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
puny rollout yeah I mean that could

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.080 
puny rollout yeah I mean that could
limit<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.710> heavily<00:01:53.310> discounting<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
limit they are heavily discounting the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.899 
limit they are heavily discounting the
Moto<00:01:54.360> G<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.350> could<00:01:55.680> potentially<00:01:55.909> booth

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
Moto G so that could potentially booth

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
Moto G so that could potentially booth
their<00:01:57.180> volumes<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.960> i<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.409> i<00:01:58.560> read<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
their volumes and i think i read in the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
their volumes and i think i read in the
Wall<00:01:58.979> Street<00:01:59.130> Journal<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.700> they're

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
Wall Street Journal that they're

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.990 
Wall Street Journal that they're
potentially<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.259> expand<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.640> other

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
potentially gonna expand this to other

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.249 
potentially gonna expand this to other
phones<00:02:03.390> via<00:02:03.780> an<00:02:04.170> app<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:07.049> all<00:02:07.229> likelihood

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
phones via an app so in all likelihood

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.150 
phones via an app so in all likelihood
it<00:02:08.160> will<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.610> expanded<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.920> start

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it will be expanded you know to start

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.339 
it will be expanded you know to start
obviously<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:11.970> one<00:02:12.150> phone<00:02:12.390> somewhat<00:02:13.050> limits

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
obviously with one phone somewhat limits

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.180 
obviously with one phone somewhat limits
you<00:02:13.440> but

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you but

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.800 
you but
uh<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.580> know<00:02:14.670> maybe<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.060> made<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> easier

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
uh you know maybe that made it easier

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.780 
uh you know maybe that made it easier
for<00:02:15.990> cablevision<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.800> get<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> service<00:02:17.640> off

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
Kevin but you mentioned an app this is

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.310 
Kevin but you mentioned an app this is
going<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> work<00:02:33.570> with<00:02:33.720> an<00:02:33.840> app<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.200> going

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
going to work with an app is that going

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.430 
going to work with an app is that going
to<00:02:34.410> automatically<00:02:35.130> log<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.930> users<00:02:37.260> or

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
to automatically log in for the users or

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.380 
to automatically log in for the users or
will<00:02:37.560> they<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.860> log<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.550> individually<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
will they have to log in individually to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.870 
will they have to log in individually to
every<00:02:39.600> single<00:02:39.750> Wi-Fi<00:02:40.170> network<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.340> goal<00:02:41.640> is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
every single Wi-Fi network the goal is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.380 
every single Wi-Fi network the goal is
to<00:02:41.910> auto<00:02:42.600> authenticate<00:02:43.500> with<00:02:43.740> all<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.820> hot

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
to auto authenticate with all of the hot

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.840 
to auto authenticate with all of the hot
spots<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.900> are<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.530> cablevision<00:02:46.890> Wi-Fi

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
spots that are on the cablevision Wi-Fi

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.880 
spots that are on the cablevision Wi-Fi
network<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.850> definitely<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.560> will

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
network so that definitely you know will

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.970 
network so that definitely you know will
make<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.160> easier<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:54.260> users<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.710> service

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
make it easier for users of this service

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.660 
make it easier for users of this service
to<00:02:56.160> make<00:02:56.880> calls<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.450> send<00:02:58.020> texts<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.670> access

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
to make calls to send texts to access

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.820 
to make calls to send texts to access
the<00:02:59.820> internet<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.210> their<00:03:00.330> phones<00:03:00.830> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the internet on their phones the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.330 
the internet on their phones the
downside<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:04.110> know<00:03:04.230> while<00:03:04.590> 1.1

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
downside is that you know while 1.1

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
downside is that you know while 1.1
million<00:03:05.670> hotspots<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> lot<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.260> not

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
million hotspots is a lot it's not

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.740 
million hotspots is a lot it's not
everywhere<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.850> not<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.210> same<00:03:09.480> as

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
everywhere and it's not the same as

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.890 
everywhere and it's not the same as

carriers do so that limited footprint
you<00:03:19.170> know<00:03:19.260> potentially<00:03:19.850> limits<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.270> reach<00:03:21.900> of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
people who this is going to be a pretty

people who this is going to be a pretty
viable<00:04:46.479> option<00:04:46.960> for<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.410> don't<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:48.580> that
