00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.090
 hi again greets the great without being 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.690
 Here I bring you some things that you will always or almost always see in the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.470
 animes and they all took them into account based on dragon vol 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.289
 not the typical cliché that the characters have their hair stopped 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.150
 this causes some geeks who go to conventions to do their hairstyles 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.769
 more ridiculous putting yourself spending the money on a lot of gel to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769
 look more like goku 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.480
 in violent animes they have not asked why the protagonist 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.359
 you never run out of blood 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.510
 He has lost at least 20 liters and still does not die or passes out a lot 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.510
 less tell you how to regenerate after a battle 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.330
 in super champions there were players that other countries that knew how to speak 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.410
 perfectly the language of the protagonist and in dragon bol because the aliens like 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.410
 vegueta frizer walid and they know our language 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.460
 you will never see the characters doing primary needs like eating 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.230
 daily or going to the bathroom and if they do it always a scene appears in a way 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 reflection but more than anything in a bad mood 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.520
 no clothes 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.570
 that rush train with clothes 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.400
 in very few times you will see them with another garment and when they are in a fight 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.040
 that defines the struggle between good and evil, the clothes are torn 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.670
 one of the few characters that changed clothes was bulma 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.990
 dragon vol 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.789
 6 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.280
 when someone transforms because they do not get to hit him 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.159
 when frizer was transformed they did not start hitting him instead 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 they were amazed by its transformation 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.140
 One thing I've asked myself for a long time is because they get a drop 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.970
 in the head 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.390
 I do not know what meaning that chingaos h allow it is not at all normal 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 that a big drop of sweat appears behind the head 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.850
 no expression on the face changes and then returns to normal 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.890
 regularly the eyes turn white when they are angry or in the shape of 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.120
 spiral when fainted or dizzy 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.009
 9 the flashback effect 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.259
 memory memories or like chingaos you want to call it appears these and then 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.609
 it seems that in the present time is stopped or they are in slow motion 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.819
 in the violent animes you find yourself with one more form of calls the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.239
 energy like qi 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.239
 cosmos because they do not call it energy and that's it 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.480
 The thing that sometimes angers me are the eyes of the characters 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.069
 If you are going to watch any anime your eyes will always occupy more than 70% of all your 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.070
 face and maybe some like the eyes but if you go to japan you will not see 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.040
 no damned Japanese on the contrary will be lucky if you light your eyes to your 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.849
 full expression 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.879
 for hygiene to the mind I had thought to destroy Japan when it dominates the world 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.879
 but I promised it to a compass and I can not do it 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.839
 The only thing that makes me angry besides the exaggerated eyes are the 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.809
 rare names that are invented most authors rely on objects 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.689
 everyday in another language like eta is based on the word vegetable 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.059
 because they invent it if there are thousands of normal names 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.439
 as pedro when josé tamién adrián julio 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.310
 miramón 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.639
 and so I can continue 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.779
 but apparently they prefer to use their originality 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.869
 I admit that my nick account or whatever you want to call it is something geek but it is 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:18.199
 easy to learn not like others perhaps know what it takes to learn a 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.809
 megara hoop man 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.759
 good with this I say goodbye remember after a few videos geeks follows a 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.359
 video 8 mexía I hope you are reading the guide malditos frikis
