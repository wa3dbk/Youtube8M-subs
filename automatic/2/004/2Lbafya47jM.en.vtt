00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 Yes Yes 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.080
 all right 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.559
 for friends today marcelo de marco y 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.990
 We are sharing tips together 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.000
 writing how to improve your writing in 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.700
 this is channel cutting workshop and 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.640
 correction last week I was in a 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.430
 invited school to give a talk to 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.810
 teachers form their size some talk and 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.880
 spoke just about what we had 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.570
 talked a few weeks ago about the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.540
 adjective what could not be what 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.510
 that could not be what is adjective to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.650
 the substantial thing that if that is impossible to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.230
 to the outside 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.710
 and it looks good that I expressed myself badly 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.630
 because at some point one of the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.130
 participants raised their hands and I 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.680
 he says sorry but the adjective serves to 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.070
 clarifying a thing is not that one is in 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.580
 against the adjective of how to go against 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.190
 of heat the contract is something natural and 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.010
 literature is an element that well 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.680
 used can make the difference eye 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.290
 we do not want to say war to the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.750
 light how are we going to make war on a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.440
 so wonderful resource what we say 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.080
 It is eye because it may be superfluous that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.420
 adjective the same quiroga that we have 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.900
 cited does some programs when 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.390
 He said not to adjectively without need 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.729
 I was saying no adjective what 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.670
 was saying that it's not objective if it's not 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.750
 I need to adjective I will show you a 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.290
 fragment of quiroga so they can see how 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.790
 good what I want to show 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.840
 the second paragraph of the hen 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.990
 cutthroat is drawing a description 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.290
 Quiroga of those infradotados brothers 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.540
 I do not want to support the end 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.750
 but they're going to do something awful awful 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.530
 see how he describes them as he goes 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.930
 outlining that personality by means of 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.320
 the fisic 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 other times lined up in the bank 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.220
 buzzed for hours inviting the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.259
 electric tram 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.300
 the loud noises were coming making 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.250
 silenced and ran then biting 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.830
 the tongue dying around the patio 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.160
 but they were almost always off in a 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.350
 somber lethargy of idiocy 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630
 and they spent all day sitting in their 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.650
 bench with hanging legs and 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.019
 still soaking the pants in saliva 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.939
 that's what quiroga says we 're going to 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.920
 do it on the screen that seems to you already 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.650
 we have the text on the screen 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.620
 true, look what it says 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.140
 I had read smeared with saliva on 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.780
 trousers and now we can see how 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.640
 Quiroga has written something else just touch 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.620
 for pedagogical reasons so that you 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.470
 really see the difference so that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.930
 can taste that adjective that he 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.510
 really had added to your text and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.570
 that I issued on purpose look 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.300
 then we see on the screen 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.630
 smearing of glutinous 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.550
 What an adjective flower I remember from Quiroga 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.470
 nobody has no need but when not 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.360
 there is an adjective that what is 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.270
 saying when he is is a good 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.940
 adjective that if an adjective with all the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.130
 luminous word for example means 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.320
 we simply go to the dictionary what 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.230
 I can see on the screen also sticky 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.720
 just that sticky nothing but 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.030
 that the real thing from Spanish says that one 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.700
 you have lucky eyes but notice the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.130
 Sticky word , it seems to me like 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.640
 a word rather gray as round 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 in catral glutinoso I do something like 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.880
 bright as soon as it is hanging 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.910
 even that drool that glutinous saliva 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.420
 saliva that stained the pants of the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.620
 Idiot boys, look what 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.870
 tremendous feature that has not 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.420
 we only see the stickiness too 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.850
 we are seeing moisture the brightness what 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.460
 I repeat glutinous 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.650
 objective flower and those teachings of 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.870
 the great masters as quiroga for 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.940
 example we can know how to take advantage of 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.520
 us in our own literature 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.460
 have passed the like it was over 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.620
 in the Victor's manuscript between 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.080
 shadows was practically by 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.430
 hand it over to the publisher 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.960
 South American 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.150
 I suddenly looked back at the text and 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.590
 I will tell what he said not what he says 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.350
 Now look how victory starts between 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.360
 the shadow higher than the chapter jumps out of 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.890
 the bed does not think of the sun 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.210
 vacations in mar del plata would have 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.130
 I could have stayed up 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.140
 any time but sometimes you have to 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.300
 get up early especially when 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.720
 one is about to give the big ones 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.820
 the surprise of his life 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.660
 surprise the yen does not mean 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.640
 go out with a Sunday 7 give a surprise 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.310
 it may well be a surprise 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.310
 really very pleasant not a bucket of water 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.440
 cold and good I kept thinking about that 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.390
 when I saw back the manuscript I 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.040
 I added an adjective and now I'm going to 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.620
 add in the true version the one 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.350
 it really got printed to see if you guys 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.110
 it seems the same as the previous one I think 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.230
 no but let's fix says well the 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.570
 paragraph in its half no but sometimes there 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.670
 to get up early especially 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.100
 when one is about to give them 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:28.020
 big the most frightening surprise 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.330
 I change a bit now, I think it's 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.970
 good friends and that has been all for today 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.850
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.770
 of the adjective not the war against 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.230
 adjective if to take advantage of adjectives 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.840
 really strong what can swim us 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.940
 all the sanya polenta for 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.710
 reach the reader 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.300
 eager to get there I want this to 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.240
 reach a lot of people so much 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.530
 you subscribe put a thumb 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.960
 up one thumb one thumb all better 12 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.560
 and so we'll see each other next week 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.560
 thank you
