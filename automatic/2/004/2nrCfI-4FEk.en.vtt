zombies not spawn sense really on the
server<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.210> there<00:00:12.570> will<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.840> better<00:00:13.110> control

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
server so there will be a better control

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.060 
server so there will be a better control
over<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.009> zombies<00:00:14.340> bonds<00:00:15.020> zombies<00:00:16.020> Beth<00:00:16.289> Beth

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
spawn there'll be more realistic spawns

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.420 
spawn there'll be more realistic spawns
and<00:00:38.430> more<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.360> too<00:00:39.629> rich<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.590> we're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and more are too rich so we're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.049 
and more are too rich so we're
survivalism<00:00:42.300> experience<00:00:43.579> now<00:00:44.579> let's<00:00:44.879> spawn

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
survivalism experience now let's spawn

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.630 
survivalism experience now let's spawn
sidecars<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.680> open<00:00:47.039> doors<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.550> the

you<00:02:13.370> eat<00:02:13.520> something<00:02:13.790> you'll<00:02:14.150> drop<00:02:14.360> empty<00:02:14.720> can

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
you eat something you'll drop empty can

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.790 
you eat something you'll drop empty can
and<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.890> empty<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.490> will<00:02:16.700> store<00:02:16.940> your<00:02:16.970> DNA

around for people and people can use

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.250 
around for people and people can use
dogs<00:02:25.250> walk<00:02:25.490> around<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.060> rockets<00:02:27.020> also

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
dogs walk around for you rockets also

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.410 
dogs walk around for you rockets also
say<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.470> there<00:02:28.100> may<00:02:28.400> be<00:02:28.430> grafting<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.240> there

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
say that there may be grafting in there
