dynamic I want to have a couple
different<00:00:17.460> size<00:00:17.820> prints<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.420> we've<00:00:18.630> got<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
different size prints so we've got a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.010 
different size prints so we've got a
hundred<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.470> six<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:21.180> small<00:00:21.330> size<00:00:21.720> which

are<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> 44<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:30.750> 55<00:00:31.320> prints<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.759> big<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
are the 44 by 55 prints that are big and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
are the 44 by 55 prints that are big and
beautiful<00:00:35.690> we<00:00:36.690> used<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> always<00:00:37.410> outsource

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
beautiful we used to always outsource

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
beautiful we used to always outsource
our<00:00:38.550> printing<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.960> rarely

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
our printing and we're rarely

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.049 
our printing and we're rarely
disappointed<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.340> mostly<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:41.940> we

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
disappointed but mostly because we

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
disappointed but mostly because we
didn't<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.170> were<00:00:43.290> missing<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.950> now

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
didn't know what we were missing and now

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.869 
didn't know what we were missing and now
we<00:00:44.430> brought<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> in-house<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
we brought it in-house and we have a

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
we brought it in-house and we have a
total<00:00:47.879> creative<00:00:48.510> control<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
total creative control so one of the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.600 
total creative control so one of the
reasons<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.460> chose<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.000> stylist<00:00:51.390> Pro<00:00:51.600> 90<00:00:51.960> 90<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
reasons I chose the stylist Pro 90 90 is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.029 
reasons I chose the stylist Pro 90 90 is
size<00:00:54.110> most<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> prints<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:55.680> doing<00:00:55.890> are

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
size most of the prints we're doing are

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
size most of the prints we're doing are
44<00:00:56.520> by<00:00:56.640> 55<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.050> needed<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.440> wide<00:00:58.770> roll

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
44 by 55 and so we needed that wide roll

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.660 
44 by 55 and so we needed that wide roll
number<00:00:59.730> two<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.870> speed<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.800> doing<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.219> huge

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
number two is speed we're doing a huge

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.539 
number two is speed we're doing a huge
volume<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.300> prints<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.840> printing<00:01:04.229> 45<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.339> those

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
volume of prints or printing 45 of those

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
volume of prints or printing 45 of those
and<00:01:07.100> for<00:01:08.100> earlier<00:01:08.939> iterations<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.869> earlier

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and for earlier iterations or earlier

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.679 
and for earlier iterations or earlier
technologies<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.640> would<00:01:11.790> take<00:01:12.030> forever<00:01:12.240> but

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
technologies that would take forever but

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.800 
technologies that would take forever but
the<00:01:13.170> ninety<00:01:13.500> eight<00:01:13.590> ninety<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.729> mean<00:01:15.210> guys

the ninety eight ninety is I mean guys

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
the ninety eight ninety is I mean guys
it's<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.680> spitting<00:01:17.070> prints<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.700> lightning

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's it's spitting prints out lightning

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
it's it's spitting prints out lightning

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
this thing even running right now and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.120 
this thing even running right now and
then<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.730> plant<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:41.010> coming<00:02:42.010> out
