I'll kind of scallop out your car on

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.429 
I'll kind of scallop out your car on
this<00:00:29.070> class<00:00:29.369> car<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.599> inside<00:00:30.960> curve

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this class car I have one inside curve

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.190 
this class car I have one inside curve
here<00:00:32.030> the<00:00:33.030> nice<00:00:33.180> thing<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.110> have

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
here the nice thing about this is I have

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920 
here the nice thing about this is I have
a<00:00:34.260> wide<00:00:34.739> variety<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.430> spindles<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> have

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
a wide variety of spindles if you have

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.569 
a wide variety of spindles if you have
really<00:00:37.079> small<00:00:37.440> inside<00:00:37.860> curves<00:00:38.190> you'll<00:00:38.460> just

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
really small inside curves you'll just

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.069 
really small inside curves you'll just
need<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.969> me<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.300> switch<00:00:39.600> these<00:00:39.809> up

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
need to see me and I'll switch these up

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
need to see me and I'll switch these up
so<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.680> stand<00:00:40.920> smaller<00:00:41.340> details

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so that you can stand smaller details

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.040 
so that you can stand smaller details
and<00:00:42.230> then<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:45.050> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and then they go all the way up to this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.069 
and then they go all the way up to this
size<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.789> disks<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.420> these<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.870> we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
size I do have disks for these but we

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.540 
size I do have disks for these but we
very<00:00:49.260> rarely<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.770> curves<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
very rarely have curves that are this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.319 
very rarely have curves that are this
big<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> got<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> second

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
big the one I got on now is the second

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.110 
big the one I got on now is the second
biggest<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.960> does<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.410> nice<00:00:55.649> job

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
biggest one this does a really nice job

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.840 
biggest one this does a really nice job
for<00:00:57.120> sanding<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.629> size<00:00:57.930> curves<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.850> just

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
for sanding these size curves and just

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
for sanding these size curves and just
check<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.840> size<00:01:01.020> curve<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.649> may

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
check to see what size curve you may

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.579 
check to see what size curve you may
need<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.280> sand<00:01:02.840> remember<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> removes<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> lot

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
need to sand remember it removes a lot

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
need to sand remember it removes a lot
of<00:01:04.650> material<00:01:05.280> most<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.210> 80<00:01:06.510> grit

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
of material most of these are 80 grit

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.130 
of material most of these are 80 grit
spindles<00:01:07.740> these<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.850> 120<00:01:09.659> so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
spindles these I think are 120 so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.630 
spindles these I think are 120 so
they're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.619> very<00:01:10.740> aggressive<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
they're going to be very aggressive and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.200 
they're going to be very aggressive and
remove<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> material<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.640> boss<00:01:14.880> are

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
remove a lot of material the boss are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.359 
remove a lot of material the boss are
oscillating<00:01:15.600> sander<00:01:16.170> spins<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
oscillating sander spins around in the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
oscillating sander spins around in the
circle<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.750> goes<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.830> keep

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
circle and also goes up and down to keep

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.960 
circle and also goes up and down to keep
the<00:01:20.509> sanding<00:01:21.509> part<00:01:21.720> moving<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:23.759> will

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the sanding part moving and this will

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.920 
the sanding part moving and this will
spin<00:01:24.240> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.680 

counterclockwise<00:01:29.100> direction<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.450> want<00:01:31.630> to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
counterclockwise direction so we want to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.300 
counterclockwise direction so we want to
do<00:01:31.810> when<00:01:31.990> we're<00:01:32.140> sanding<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.650> we<00:01:32.770> want<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.070> feed

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
do when we're sanding is we want to feed

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.480 
do when we're sanding is we want to feed
our<00:01:33.490> car<00:01:33.790> into<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:35.049> spin<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:36.070> will<00:01:36.250> create

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
our car into the spin that will create

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.430 
our car into the spin that will create
friction<00:01:36.850> if<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:37.479> feed<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.869> with<00:01:38.140> the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
friction if we feed it with the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320 
friction if we feed it with the
direction<00:01:38.979> it's<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.790> move<00:01:39.940> your<00:01:40.150> car

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
direction it's going to move your car

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.760 
direction it's going to move your car
and<00:01:40.479> it's<00:01:40.570> not<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.810> remove<00:01:41.080> any<00:01:41.229> material

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
and it's not to remove any material

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.460 
and it's not to remove any material
there<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.729> little<00:01:43.119> arrow<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.750> these<00:01:44.200> blue

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
there is a little arrow on these blue

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
there is a little arrow on these blue
discs<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:47.020> will<00:01:47.259> go<00:01:47.700> around<00:01:48.700> different

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
discs these will go around different

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.590 
discs these will go around different
spindles<00:01:50.049> depending<00:01:50.470> on<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> size<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.450> you'll

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
spindles depending on the size so you'll

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.840 
spindles depending on the size so you'll
just<00:01:52.659> have<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.990> find<00:01:53.259> one<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:54.009> matches

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
just have to find one that that matches

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.539 
just have to find one that that matches
the<00:01:55.000> size<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:55.830> insert<00:01:56.830> goes<00:01:57.130> with<00:01:57.399> this

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
the size so this insert goes with this

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.139 
the size so this insert goes with this
spindle

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
spindle
