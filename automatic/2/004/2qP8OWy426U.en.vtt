so<00:00:00.989> in<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.890> wanted<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.340> give<00:00:02.460> a

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so in this video I wanted to give a

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.370 
so in this video I wanted to give a
brief<00:00:02.730> introduction<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.449> generating<00:00:04.110> random

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
brief introduction to generating random

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.410 
brief introduction to generating random
numbers<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.190> actually<00:00:05.279> also<00:00:05.700> random

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
numbers and actually also random

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.960 
numbers and actually also random
matrices<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.990> numbers<00:00:07.290> using<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.770> lab<00:00:07.970> now

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
matrices of numbers using that lab now

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.000 
matrices of numbers using that lab now
if<00:00:09.059> you're<00:00:09.150> unfamiliar<00:00:09.599> with<00:00:09.719> MATLAB<00:00:10.230> then

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
if you're unfamiliar with MATLAB then

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.860 
if you're unfamiliar with MATLAB then
this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.000> might<00:00:12.120> see<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.540> open

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
this is what you might see if you open

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.140 
this is what you might see if you open
up<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> program<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> middle<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
up the program in the middle which is

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.420 
up the program in the middle which is
the<00:00:15.330> important<00:00:15.990> part<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.680> focus<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.310> now

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the important part to focus on for now

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.890 
the important part to focus on for now
we<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.880> what's<00:00:18.119> called<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.390> command<00:00:18.660> window

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
we have what's called a command window

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.390 
we have what's called a command window
and<00:00:19.260> that's<00:00:19.380> where<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> type

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and that's where we're going to type

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
and that's where we're going to type
commands<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.689> other<00:00:21.840> videos<00:00:22.199> we'll<00:00:22.439> talk

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
commands and in other videos we'll talk

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.740 
commands and in other videos we'll talk
about<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.609> some<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> these<00:00:23.939> other<00:00:24.150> screens

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
about what some of these other screens

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.339 
about what some of these other screens
mean<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.580> core<00:00:26.880> random<00:00:27.599> number<00:00:27.869> generator

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
mean so the core random number generator

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.679 
mean so the core random number generator
in<00:00:28.619> MATLAB<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> function<00:00:29.820> called<00:00:30.029> Rand<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
in MATLAB is a function called Rand and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.680 
in MATLAB is a function called Rand and
if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> type<00:00:31.949> brands<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:33.149> you'll<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.480> pop

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
if you type brands what you'll see pop

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
if you type brands what you'll see pop
up<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.980> random<00:00:35.430> number<00:00:35.760> between<00:00:35.910> 0<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.690> 1<00:00:36.870> if

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
up is a random number between 0 and 1 if

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.830 
up is a random number between 0 and 1 if
I<00:00:37.800> type<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> again<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> different<00:00:39.000> number

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I type it again I see a different number

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.670 
I type it again I see a different number
so<00:00:40.500> Rand<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.610> used<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.149> generate<00:00:42.680> numbers

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
so Rand can be used to generate numbers

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.200 
so Rand can be used to generate numbers
which<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:43.980> uniformly<00:00:44.430> chosen<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
which are uniformly chosen in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.010 
which are uniformly chosen in the
interval<00:00:45.480> 0<00:00:45.690> 1<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.250> choose

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
interval 0 1 and you can also choose

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.650 
interval 0 1 and you can also choose
multiple<00:00:49.020> such<00:00:49.440> numbers<00:00:49.940> simultaneously<00:00:50.940> by

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
multiple such numbers simultaneously by

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.920 
multiple such numbers simultaneously by
giving<00:00:52.020> Rand<00:00:52.289> various<00:00:52.920> inputs<00:00:53.539> now<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
giving Rand various inputs now if you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
giving Rand various inputs now if you
type<00:00:55.289> Rand<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> parentheses<00:00:56.430> you'll<00:00:56.940> see

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
type Rand with a parentheses you'll see

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.900 
type Rand with a parentheses you'll see
some<00:00:57.360> options<00:00:57.539> pop<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.430> type<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
some options pop up if you just type a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.869 
some options pop up if you just type a
single<00:01:00.239> number<00:01:00.739> what<00:01:01.739> you'll<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
single number what you'll get is a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.649 
single number what you'll get is a
matrix<00:01:03.390> which<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.070> 10<00:01:05.070> rows<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.729> 10<00:01:06.299> columns

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
matrix which has 10 rows and 10 columns

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.280 
matrix which has 10 rows and 10 columns
for<00:01:06.930> example<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.409> enter<00:01:07.439> 10<00:01:08.180> 500<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
for example if I enter 10 500 to get a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.460 
for example if I enter 10 500 to get a
matrix<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.770> 2<00:01:10.950> rows<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.189> 2<00:01:11.369> columns<00:01:12.200> if<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.320> add

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
matrix of 2 rows and 2 columns if I add

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.080 
matrix of 2 rows and 2 columns if I add
a<00:01:13.710> second<00:01:14.159> argument<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.850> example<00:01:15.210> 2<00:01:15.450> comma<00:01:15.720> 1

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
a second argument for example 2 comma 1

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
a second argument for example 2 comma 1
then<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> will<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> matrix<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.920> 2

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
then what I will get is a matrix with 2

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280 
then what I will get is a matrix with 2
rows<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> 1<00:01:20.759> column<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> compare

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
rows and 1 column and you can compare

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.719 
rows and 1 column and you can compare
that<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.920> happen<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.400> entered

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that with what would happen if I entered

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
that with what would happen if I entered
1<00:01:24.000> comma<00:01:24.299> 2<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.780> example<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.710> give

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
1 comma 2 for example which would give

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
1 comma 2 for example which would give
me<00:01:25.950> 1<00:01:26.130> row<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.340> 2<00:01:26.580> column<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> an

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
me 1 row and 2 column so this is an

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.120 
me 1 row and 2 column so this is an
important<00:01:28.229> thing<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.470> always<00:01:28.560> remember<00:01:28.650> about

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
important thing to always remember about

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.969 
important thing to always remember about

function another useful function is
Randi<00:01:45.229> which<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:47.369> short<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.729> random<00:01:48.540> integer

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
Randi which is short for random integer

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and the way that Randy works is if you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.429 
and the way that Randy works is if you

give it 1 arguments for example 6 let's
say<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> does<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.590> generates<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
say what it does is it generates a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.480 
say what it does is it generates a
random<00:01:59.880> integer<00:02:00.119> between<00:02:00.409> 1<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.590> 6<00:02:01.829> uniformly

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
random integer between 1 and 6 uniformly

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.219 
random integer between 1 and 6 uniformly
chosen<00:02:02.969> from<00:02:03.149> those<00:02:03.299> six<00:02:03.630> numbers<00:02:03.719> for

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
chosen from those six numbers for

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.930 
chosen from those six numbers for
example<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.640> typed<00:02:06.140> Randi<00:02:07.140> 10<00:02:07.429> then<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
example so if I typed Randi 10 then you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.699 
example so if I typed Randi 10 then you
know<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.360> 1<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.780> time<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.500> could

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
know I got 1 this time but I could

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.660 
know I got 1 this time but I could
repeat<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> command

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
repeat the command

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.890 
repeat the command
of<00:02:11.730> course<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.330> different<00:02:12.510> numbers

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
of course I would get different numbers

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.050 
of course I would get different numbers
uniformly<00:02:13.680> distributed<00:02:14.280> between<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
uniformly distributed between one and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.570 
uniformly distributed between one and
ten<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.140> Randi<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.770> useful<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:17.430> example

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
ten so Randi can be useful for example

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.729 
ten so Randi can be useful for example
if<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.150> wanted<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> simulate<00:02:18.780> roles<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
if you wanted to simulate roles of a

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.610 
if you wanted to simulate roles of a
fair<00:02:20.010> die<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.780> also<00:02:21.900> generate<00:02:22.170> matrices

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
fair die you can also generate matrices

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160 
fair die you can also generate matrices
of<00:02:23.160> numbers<00:02:23.520> with<00:02:23.760> Randy<00:02:24.209> by<00:02:24.660> supplying

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
of numbers with Randy by supplying

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.320 
of numbers with Randy by supplying
additional<00:02:25.349> arguments<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> first

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
additional arguments so the first

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.960 
additional arguments so the first
argument<00:02:27.690> always<00:02:28.410> gives<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.950> maximum<00:02:29.550> value

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
argument always gives the maximum value

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.479 
argument always gives the maximum value
that<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.660> generated<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.470> then<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
that can be generated and then the

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.150 
that can be generated and then the
second<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.000> third<00:02:33.239> arguments<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.590> choose

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
second and third arguments if you choose

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.640 
second and third arguments if you choose
to<00:02:35.190> enter<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.760> would<00:02:36.420> give<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.750> size<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
to enter them would give the size of the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100 
to enter them would give the size of the
matrix<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.370> you're<00:02:39.180> asking<00:02:39.600> MATLAB<00:02:39.959> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
matrix that you're asking MATLAB to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.259 
matrix that you're asking MATLAB to
generate<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:40.980> example<00:02:41.310> Randy<00:02:41.670> six<00:02:41.970> five

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
generate so for example Randy six five

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.040 
generate so for example Randy six five
one<00:02:42.620> generates<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.950> matrix<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:45.510> five<00:02:45.780> rows

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
one generates a matrix with five rows

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.949 
one generates a matrix with five rows
one<00:02:46.410> column<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.209> numbers<00:02:48.209> drawn<00:02:48.569> at<00:02:48.930> random

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
one column and numbers drawn at random

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.620 
one column and numbers drawn at random
from<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.709> through<00:02:49.950> six<00:02:50.269> now<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.330> can<00:02:51.480> also

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
from one through six now you can also

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
from one through six now you can also
store<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.680> output<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:54.239> use<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.049> Randy<00:02:55.470> or
