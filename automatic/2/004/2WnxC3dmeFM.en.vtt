break and you just simply do a double
lint<00:03:55.730> it's<00:03:55.910> very<00:03:56.120> simple<00:03:56.390> since<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.870> did<00:03:57.110> your

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
lint it's very simple since you did your

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.190 
lint it's very simple since you did your
pinkie<00:03:58.160> break<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.510> just<00:03:59.660> do<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> double

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
pinkie break so you just do a double

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.289 
pinkie break so you just do a double
lift<00:04:00.380> just<00:04:00.739> like<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.130> right<00:04:01.790> because<00:04:01.940> of

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
lift just like this right because of

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.840 
lift just like this right because of
your<00:04:02.540> double<00:04:02.780> back<00:04:03.140> or<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.620> looks<00:04:04.070> as<00:04:04.310> if<00:04:04.370> you

performance<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.250> will<00:04:16.579> see<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.299> would

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
performance you will see this you would

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.509 
performance you will see this you would
see<00:04:17.539> another<00:04:17.780> car<00:04:18.019> flip<00:04:18.320> over<00:04:18.620> that's<00:04:19.160> why

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
see another car flip over that's why

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.860 
see another car flip over that's why
it's<00:04:19.700> important<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.150> have<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.359> double<00:04:20.840> back

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
right there you put the double backer

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.270 
right there you put the double backer
inside<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.210> center<00:04:26.479> of<00:04:26.689> the<00:04:26.960> pack<00:04:27.169> just<00:04:28.039> like
