00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.570
 good to other fears of a new video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.729
 good it seems that they have been revealed 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.669
 new details of grand theft auto 5 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.650
 through an interview in cvg 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.799
 and good of tissue I think they are pretty 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.419
 quite interesting not one of them 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.550
 for example it 's basically that we're going to 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.010
 be able to shoot the gas tank of 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.019
 a vehicle and well so you have 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 leaks the car that may even have 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.800
 an accident is that same car because 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.539
 then we can shoot the gasoline that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.279
 the car exploded that what basically 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.570
 would do is facilitate certain missions 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.760
 also stop for example a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.560
 vehicle and especially so give it more 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 realism no more details of what already 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.700
 it seems that he is going to have not the epa 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.140
 that is, we can raise bombs 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.190
 limpets in a car and it seems good that 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.470
 I suppose we'll have a remote point 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 to exploit it when we want or 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.200
 I do not know if it exploded when the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480
 car is not in that sense but 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 basically we will have limpet pumps for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.080
 put in what are cars has also been 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 talked about there are more than a thousand options 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.220
 of personalization of automobiles 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 well we can see something like that in the trailer 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.650
 in the last trailer of it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 good gameplay I guess in a thousand 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.809
 options is concerned I suppose that all 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.979
 the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.020
 the ones to all the exhaust pipes 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.090
 and all those things I do not think it's a thousand 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.890
 different things that we can touch but 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.450
 well basically we have many 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.979
 options not in that sense grams that 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.590
 we're going to be bored that I guess in 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.570
 almost no car will be the same as the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.340
 earlier it's going to be very difficult that we're going 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.619
 that we repeat vehicles and we're going to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.179
 customize the other of the things that yes 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.159
 we customize a vehicle and it seems to be 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.960
 that we leave it on the street or I guess 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.390
 badly parked and we do not let it work in 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.460
 our garage and such may it end 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 in a municipal warehouse and we have to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.840
 pay a fine to get it back something 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.090
 that he does it as I say so even more 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.039
 more realistic not of what already of what 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.330
 already seems to come back to repeat good and 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.799
 you all know that there will be enough 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.990
 variable weapons all the weapons that 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.330
 we choose are going to be there throughout 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.530
 the game and we will be able to customize them 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.020
 do not customize them so that 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.209
 we want to finish a mission does not seem to be 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 that missions are not going to have 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.929
 only one way we will be able to do 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.729
 do it in various ways like this has 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.659
 could see maybe in the gameplay not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.000
 He has directly explained to us 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.530
 directly but basically it's going to 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 can do it if we want to go more 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.860
 stealthy as we will be able to make 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.130
 do you do that customization 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 of the weapons thing that today I believe 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.100
 that it helps a lot that the game is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.720
 different and that playable air 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.270
 I think it 's quite satisfactory 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.010
 to have that body attacks to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 body are going to be much more much more 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.320
 much more improved basically put here 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.030
 that it will be more satisfying to fight 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.400
 body to body and we'll see to see how it is 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.700
 and I suppose so good that it will be given 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.950
 more realism and this kind of thing good 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 in the destruction in the game you're going to 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.850
 improve is also something we can see 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.490
 in the gameplay not in a kind of 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.470
 structure like that of bricks that 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.910
 it breaks that it looked like it's going to 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.380
 be improved but good here emphasize 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.560
 in this interview that basically that 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.540
 it will be much more improved than good 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160
 the artificial intelligence the artificial 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.160
 will not be as passive as in previous 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.170
 good deliveries it seems that your 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.270
 enemies know where they are where you are and 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.610
 that they are going to take advantage of that 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.670
 look for you at a certain moment placed something 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.590
 well it will not be so easy to dodge 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.230
 example the police if such and especially to 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.280
 rival gangs with which therefore what 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.690
 let's keep in mind the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.010
 artificial intelligence has been improved 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.390
 you could also see something 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.120
 previous trailer in the gameplay that 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.829
 we could see how good the police do not 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.989
 He sounded with little girls and drove a lot 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.370
 pretty good, it also seems 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.510
 we approach the other quite differences 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.370
 for example if we face the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.720
 swats we're going to see that they're 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.579
 very well organized and that is going to 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.349
 cost quite to finish them but 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.730
 however some normal gang members 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.680
 they can do the opposite, we're not going 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.970
 to see how they are totally 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.200
 disorganized and we will be able to finish 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.430
 with them a little more easier not the same 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.930
 you know how good we are going to have a 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.879
 lots of possibilities thanks to the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.379
 three protagonists and what good position 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.480
 it's just the beginning in a lot more 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.530
 details as you know and really I 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.299
 I think it's going to be a pretty game 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.799
 pretty good to remember that it will be 17 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.659
 September and well nothing more kids 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.079
 this is seen only in the next video 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.079
 approximates
