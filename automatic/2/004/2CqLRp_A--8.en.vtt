00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
and it's doable to bushwhack through but

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.690 
and it's doable to bushwhack through but
we<00:00:46.570> didn't<00:00:46.750> want<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.080> okay<00:00:47.739> Mike<00:00:47.980> we<00:00:48.370> were<00:00:48.400> told

we didn't want to okay Mike we were told
this<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:48.970> possible<00:00:49.540> is<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.410> possible

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
this is possible is this possible

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.670 
this is possible is this possible
no<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:57.280> ran<00:00:57.430> out<00:00:57.610> of<00:00:57.640> water<00:00:57.820> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:59.320> we<00:00:59.500> ran

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
no we ran out of water I think we ran

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.700 
no we ran out of water I think we ran
out<00:00:59.800> of<00:00:59.830> water<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.070> long<00:01:00.130> time<00:01:00.340> ago<00:01:00.550> but<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
out of water a long time ago but and I

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.170 
out of water a long time ago but and I
know<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:03.190> wasn't<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.760> we<00:01:03.850> couldn't<00:01:04.089> get

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
know it wasn't it and we couldn't get

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.609 
know it wasn't it and we couldn't get
through<00:01:04.300> it<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:04.630> we<00:01:04.660> kind<00:01:05.020> of<00:01:05.050> went<00:01:05.199> well<00:01:05.410> well

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
through it so we kind of went well well

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.410 
through it so we kind of went well well
we'll<00:01:05.860> try<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.070> other<00:01:06.250> way<00:01:06.400> but<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.300> know

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
we'll try the other way but you know

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.270 
we'll try the other way but you know
it's<00:01:07.720> like<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.869> mystery<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.440> just<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:09.130> got

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
it's like a mystery a you just you got

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.590 
it's like a mystery a you just you got
to<00:01:09.310> find<00:01:09.700> out<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.060> knew<00:01:10.300> there<00:01:10.479> was<00:01:10.509> a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
to find out that you knew there was a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.150 
to find out that you knew there was a
route<00:01:10.810> back<00:01:10.960> here<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:11.290> one<00:01:11.440> time<00:01:11.650> so<00:01:11.920> there's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
route back here at one time so there's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160 
route back here at one time so there's
got<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.400> be<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.520> route<00:01:12.759> so<00:01:13.660> we're<00:01:13.900> on<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.080> way

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
got to be a route so we're on the way

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.140 
got to be a route so we're on the way
out<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:14.770> decided<00:01:14.860> hey<00:01:15.220> let's<00:01:15.250> have<00:01:15.580> lunch<00:01:15.700> and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.719 
is kind of odd like well who put the
rock<00:01:25.780> there<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.259> sure<00:01:26.979> enough<00:01:27.009> right<00:01:27.490> above

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729

rock there and sure enough right above
it<00:01:27.880> there<00:01:28.119> was<00:01:28.240> an<00:01:28.360> old<00:01:28.540> blazing<00:01:29.140> white<00:01:29.320> pine

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
it there was an old blazing white pine

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.480 
it there was an old blazing white pine
and<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:30.820> another<00:01:31.119> plane<00:01:31.390> we<00:01:32.050> found<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.950> bunch<00:01:33.310> of

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
and on another plane we found a bunch of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.249 
and on another plane we found a bunch of
roofing<00:01:33.789> nails<00:01:33.970> really<00:01:34.330> old<00:01:34.600> rusted<00:01:35.080> roof

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
roofing nails really old rusted roof

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.200 
roofing nails really old rusted roof
nails<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.710> indicated<00:01:36.550> there<00:01:36.640> one<00:01:36.880> time<00:01:37.030> so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
nails that indicated there one time so

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.330 
nails that indicated there one time so
we<00:01:37.240> found<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.660> trail<00:01:37.869> it's<00:01:38.830> not<00:01:39.039> really<00:01:39.310> that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
we found the trail it's not really that

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.130 
we found the trail it's not really that
walkable<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.330> can't<00:01:40.539> find<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.929> trail

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
walkable that you can't find the trail

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.980 
walkable that you can't find the trail
itself<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.310> had<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.700> we<00:01:43.600> could<00:01:43.630> push<00:01:43.959> back

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
itself so we had to we could push back

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.020 
itself so we had to we could push back
through<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.590> find<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.830> way<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.880> it's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
through and find a way and and it's

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.760 
through and find a way and and it's
really<00:01:46.090> cool<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> find<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.410> actually<00:01:47.709> you

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
really cool to find that actually you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.320 
really cool to find that actually you
know<00:01:47.860> probably<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.340> was<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:49.000> was<00:01:49.149> put

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
know probably that was that was put

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.620 
know probably that was that was put
there<00:01:49.539> back<00:01:49.929> in<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.080> 30s<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.910> we<00:01:52.330> could

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
there back in the 30s and that we could

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.480 
there back in the 30s and that we could
still<00:01:53.110> follow<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.679> it's<00:01:53.950> still<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.280> canoe

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
still follow it and it's still the canoe

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.029 
still follow it and it's still the canoe
rude<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.100> Wolf<00:01:57.670> Lake<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.860> did<00:02:00.009> a

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
rude so this is Wolf Lake and we did a

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.249 
rude so this is Wolf Lake and we did a
big<00:02:00.310> circle<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:01.750> could<00:02:01.959> have<00:02:02.080> actually

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
big circle and we could have actually

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.490 
big circle and we could have actually
two<00:02:02.530> days<00:02:02.740> ago<00:02:02.970> we<00:02:03.970> come<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.660> from<00:02:04.840> Island<00:02:05.259> -

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
two days ago we come in from Island -
