just you know have as much to gameplay

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.410 
just you know have as much to gameplay
as<00:02:15.720> again<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.730> gun<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.150> really

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
as again and this gun is really

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
as again and this gun is really
lightweight<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.959> retrospect<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
lightweight in retrospect it's kind of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.940 
lightweight in retrospect it's kind of
gonna<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.459> more<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.540> SMG<00:02:21.959> with<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.800> more

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
gonna be more of a SMG with a bit more

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.660 
gonna be more of a SMG with a bit more
of<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.100> punch<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.680> it's<00:02:25.680> lightweight<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.550> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
of a punch so it's lightweight but it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.850 
of a punch so it's lightweight but it
takes<00:02:26.819> about<00:02:27.000> six<00:02:27.930> bullets<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.470> kill<00:02:28.500> some

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
takes about six bullets to kill some

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920 
takes about six bullets to kill some
what<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> say<00:02:29.489> um<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.450> also<00:02:30.660> gotta

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
what I want to say um but you also gotta

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.590 
what I want to say um but you also gotta
keep<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.260> mind<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.430> using<00:02:32.850> an<00:02:33.030> arm<00:02:33.360> come

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
keep in mind that it's using an arm come

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.229 
keep in mind that it's using an arm come
in<00:02:33.750> t4<00:02:34.080> silencer<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.520> time<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.850> kill<00:02:36.030> may

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
in t4 silencer so the time the kill may

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.940 
in t4 silencer so the time the kill may
not<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.510> efficient<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.200> I'm<00:02:37.350> gonna<00:02:37.739> reserve

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
not be efficient but I'm gonna reserve

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.620 
not be efficient but I'm gonna reserve
my<00:02:38.220> judgment<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.880> until<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.390> try<00:02:39.569> it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
my judgment on that until I can try it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.750 
my judgment on that until I can try it
out<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> silverware<00:02:40.470> Dar<00:02:40.830> es<00:02:40.860> 6<00:02:41.340> or<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
out with the silverware Dar es 6 or a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.180 
out with the silverware Dar es 6 or a
Vulcan<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.420> rift<00:02:42.660> which<00:02:43.290> are<00:02:43.470> more<00:02:43.709> damage

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
Vulcan a rift which are more damage

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.449 
Vulcan a rift which are more damage
based<00:02:44.370> muzzles<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.500> literally<00:02:47.130> just

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
based muzzles but you can literally just

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.770 
based muzzles but you can literally just
run<00:02:47.670> around<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.000> map<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.600> don't<00:02:48.720> even

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
run around the map and you don't even

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.690 
run around the map and you don't even
have<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.050> stop<00:02:49.260> because<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.100> reload<00:02:50.430> time<00:02:50.459> is

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
have to stop because the reload time is

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.180 
have to stop because the reload time is
about<00:02:51.090> half<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.630> second<00:02:52.019> easily<00:02:52.500> maybe<00:02:52.860> even

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
about half a second easily maybe even

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.370 
about half a second easily maybe even
less<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.269> really<00:02:54.720> don't<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.260> much

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
less so you really don't have that much

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.650 
less so you really don't have that much
great<00:02:55.709> time<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.300> go<00:02:57.420> find

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
great time or you really have to go find

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
pop it in and pop it out takes about

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.930 
pop it in and pop it out takes about
less<00:03:01.799> than<00:03:01.830> half<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.250> second<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.670> you're<00:03:02.760> good

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
less than half a second and you're good

for<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.269> first<00:03:24.540> impressions<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.980> just<00:03:26.700> keep

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
for my first impressions so just keep

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.370 
for my first impressions so just keep
that<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.150> mind<00:03:27.359> but<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.780> don't<00:03:28.049> have<00:03:28.140> any

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
that in mind but I don't have any

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.470 
that in mind but I don't have any
particular<00:03:28.799> stats<00:03:29.459> or<00:03:29.670> any<00:03:29.820> specific<00:03:30.000> stats

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
particular stats or any specific stats

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150 
particular stats or any specific stats
to<00:03:30.690> go<00:03:30.810> off<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.410> can't<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:31.769> tell<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
to go off of so I can't really tell you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.190 
to go off of so I can't really tell you
until<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.670> get<00:03:32.940> my<00:03:33.030> hands<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.420> those<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.959> until

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
until I get my hands on those or until

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.810 
until I get my hands on those or until
the<00:03:34.290> gun<00:03:34.440> comes<00:03:34.620> out<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.220> can<00:03:35.250> kind<00:03:35.730> of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
the gun comes out and you can kind of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.789 
the gun comes out and you can kind of
analyze<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.959> base<00:03:37.140> that's<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.560> little<00:03:37.680> bit

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
analyze the base that's a little bit

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.770 
analyze the base that's a little bit
more<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:38.489> that's<00:03:38.790> pretty<00:03:39.209> much<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.720> a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
more but that's pretty much it for a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.509 
more but that's pretty much it for a
first<00:03:40.019> impression<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.709> bullpup<00:03:41.190> full

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
first impression on the bullpup full

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.780 
first impression on the bullpup full
auto<00:03:41.900> definitely<00:03:42.900> go<00:03:43.049> hunt<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.010> devs<00:03:44.250> in-game

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
auto definitely go hunt the devs in-game

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.220 
auto definitely go hunt the devs in-game
they're<00:03:45.030> probably<00:03:45.239> using<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.720> right<00:03:45.810> now<00:03:46.019> if

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
they're probably using it right now if

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.449 
they're probably using it right now if
you<00:03:46.350> want<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> try<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.769> out<00:03:46.920> before<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.250> comes

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you want to try it out before it comes

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.979 
you want to try it out before it comes
