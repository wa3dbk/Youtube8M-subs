00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.630
 starting making a lasagna soup and 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.699
 all the ingredients are the ones 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.650
 we use when we make a lasagna a 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.080

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.579
 fun of the this very funny me 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.199
 a lot in making a tomato sauce already 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.899
 I went to the supermarket and buy understand that 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.920

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.220

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.810

 sterilize that what is important for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.550
 grind to grind do not sterilize 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.590
 burdisso 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.220
 so that they no longer have more exactly 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.800
 to see the mushroom cut base to see 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.500
 whenever we have an ingredient 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 round we try to put a point of 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.750
 I support yes even if it is not me 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.500
 slide then much easier to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.750
 slice many many tics ok 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.970
 how are we going with the meat we are doing very well 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.060
 many muÃ±oz 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.100
 I'm already looking good rich perfect there 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.320
 less mushrooms I love me raw 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.420
 I like it more than everything because as more 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.350
 with that comes my girl we are going to add you 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.480
 at this moment the raw tomato in 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.990
 brunoise not in medium cubes that 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.290
 we dictate what you can see without seeds 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.820
 seed although some like it 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.380
 much the taste to me it seems to me that in 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.760
 this house this time we are not 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.190
 much the seed ok ok 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.770
 A) Yes 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.590
 let's go up so much the fire got off a 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.790
 bit 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:20.470
 now that we need more we have 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.530
 spinach and I forgot the garlic 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.250
 1 hid with water after 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.750
 the meat before the tomato but in this 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.090
 circumstance does not happen absolutely 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.320
 all the ingredients are being 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.840
 I'm trying not fit me 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.080
 many large groups I want me to 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.910
 are small but natural no no has 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 been inspiring tote this seems to me 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.190
 very good idea to have them ready ok 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.280
 let's 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.630
 add to destine spinach but the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.820
 true until the last one is going to be my 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.740
 last thing but I want I want to slice 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.230
 lexical nate as it is very easy 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.139
 win them several leaves I make them a 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.550
 taquito 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.740
 and debate movements 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.170

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.110
 lose the slim natalia section in 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.420
 the kitchen section in our day and 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.700
 is the simple peanut that easy 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.010
 of easy but that's how all the 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.840
 Young couples are very delicious 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.460
 well done to day you could not clear 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.250
 that if you go to the room this time to see 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.250
 You take my stools a little bit 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.159
 your knife is tight and you start 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.309
 see man slide the knife you do not see it 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.589
 well slide it where is that finger this 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:39.710
 finger does not end here nor does it grab 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:45.629
 with the nails it is held with the knuckles 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.860
 that with knuckles like that and so here you 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.249
 You can wear this you will not wear it 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.889
 Shredding the size of the cut very well 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:56.849
 be in my demanding hand but something so 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.919
 simple has very expensive duties all in 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.629
 this world you have to jump 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.349
 now we are all spinach and 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.759
 caritas and all now that we need 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.630
 I go to the supermarket and I bought a sauce for 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.350
 pasta and I will work text 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.810
 and there it is 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.230
 suddenly we are all busy we are 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.570
 working women and we can not 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.790
 suddenly make a sauce that bring a 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.730
 one hour process I go and I cope it because 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.880

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.970
 the gas is going very well very well 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.160
 crave yasmani viscera and I learned to 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.290
 do that because really public of 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.140
 truth I see that later on the face they put 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.000
 that if I do not know if I do not know how to cook 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.710
 true and it's good that I'm here with 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.780
 peanuts because I'm learning everything is 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.800
 clear and we do not have to know 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.450
 nothing in life everything in life 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.920
 here are some people who 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.750
 we know to be able to transmit a 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.230
 knowledge I did what was mine 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.230
 blender 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.729
 and we are going to add 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.440
 and ready now that we also need 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.350
 put calcium there is also a broth 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.250
 vegetables with all the husks the 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.440
 huesitos which separates and played here 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.360
 tomato with all that I made a broth of 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.810
 vegetables that I will add in this 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.810
 moment 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:23.830
 and here rich that does not know the show 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.830
 access 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.480
 I need to make the jar 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:31.730
 save with the shakhtar or as I now go 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.160
 to put pasta but I need to 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.710
 put the pasta we need this to be 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.600
 boiling has to boil after and 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.310
 because as if we know pasta if 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.570
 I put it right now it will not happen 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.280
 nothing the pasta is going to take more 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.990
 I need you to break the point 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.820
 boiling for that I'm going to cover it up for 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.699
 speed up times and then I'll 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.380
 put my pasta the spinach we are 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:53.479
 stinging ciccone and finally the 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.280
 mushrooms I want my clint 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.990
 al dente then that's why first as the 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.269
 pasta left the pasta is very well reclined 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:03.399
 it's worth it with my spinach then my 

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:06.159
 but I think thinking that in the end I'm going 

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:08.679
 to put parmesan cheese and basil ok 

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:10.869
