circles of color from the printer that
that<00:05:49.310> can<00:05:49.520> help<00:05:49.700> make<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.030> easier<00:05:50.120> but<00:05:51.310> so<00:05:52.310> in

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
that can help make it easier but so in

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
that can help make it easier but so in
this<00:05:52.640> piece<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.480> can<00:05:53.660> see<00:05:53.870> I've<00:05:54.080> got<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:55.870> red<00:05:56.870> a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
this piece you can see I've got a red a

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:10.890 
this piece you can see I've got a red a
white<00:05:59.510> a<00:05:59.870> tan<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:02.200> pink<00:06:03.200> a<00:06:04.810> brown<00:06:05.810> a<00:06:06.140> beige<00:06:08.020> green

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.480 
white a tan a pink a brown a beige green
and<00:06:11.900> I<00:06:12.290> think<00:06:12.590> that's<00:06:12.830> about<00:06:12.980> it<00:06:15.070> okay<00:06:16.070> so<00:06:16.130> this

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
and I think that's about it okay so this

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.800 
and I think that's about it okay so this
would<00:06:16.730> be<00:06:16.760> then<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:18.080> color<00:06:18.380> palette<00:06:19.660> for<00:06:20.660> my

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
would be then the color palette for my

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.680 
would be then the color palette for my
home<00:06:21.020> if<00:06:21.650> you<00:06:22.010> don't<00:06:22.220> have<00:06:22.400> your<00:06:22.550> own<00:06:22.730> home<00:06:23.360> you

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
home if you don't have your own home you

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.360 
home if you don't have your own home you
can<00:06:23.900> make<00:06:24.050> it<00:06:24.200> just<00:06:24.410> for<00:06:24.590> your<00:06:24.770> room<00:06:25.010> if<00:06:25.220> you're

apotheke it was a wax resist process

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.250 
apotheke it was a wax resist process
that<00:07:28.280> we<00:07:28.430> did<00:07:28.640> so<00:07:30.160> that<00:07:31.160> is<00:07:31.430> the<00:07:31.790> first<00:07:31.820> step<00:07:32.630> ok

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
that we did so that is the first step ok

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:41.250 
that we did so that is the first step ok
and<00:07:33.440> then

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.260 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.530 

let's<00:07:41.860> see<00:07:42.190> here<00:07:42.550> I'm<00:07:42.730> going<00:07:43.060> to<00:07:43.150> go<00:07:43.270> ahead<00:07:43.300> and

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.540 
let's see here I'm going to go ahead and

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.330 
let's see here I'm going to go ahead and
stop<00:07:43.780> this<00:07:43.990> right<00:07:44.230> now<00:07:44.260> and<00:07:44.620> then<00:07:45.100> I'll<00:07:45.190> make

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340 
stop this right now and then I'll make

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.930 
stop this right now and then I'll make
another<00:07:45.990> part<00:07:46.990> or<00:07:47.230> two<00:07:47.470> parts<00:07:47.890> so<00:07:48.400> that<00:07:48.430> we<00:07:48.730> can

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:48.940 
another part or two parts so that we can

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.330 
another part or two parts so that we can
continue<00:07:49.300> so<00:07:50.110> that's<00:07:50.350> the<00:07:50.410> first<00:07:50.680> step<00:07:50.800> I<00:07:51.100> want

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:51.340 
continue so that's the first step I want

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.650
