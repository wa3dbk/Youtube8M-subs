 claudiomar 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.530

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.300
 of the readers people have at home we now have three main 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 technologies

 lasmar or lcd 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.170
 he will know more advanced the holder of denarc 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.960
 as the consumer to choose in which is the best has to do with the best 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.580
 technology for your home 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.850
 I always and for what I read 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090
 this prospective view 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.850
 so I have no price defined here the consumer 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.590
 go meet the three children 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.030

 of the 3 envy what in the end plus the term 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.880
 I really like the classic image effect 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.420
 because of distance and just forgot - searches 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.420
 which we always have a feeling of maxi lopez revealed given 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 however despite the taste to the game with the naval 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 because of others they say she wants it I can only spend a lot more energy 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.560
 you are exceeding doctors fatec obtained through large port 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.370
 you have energy 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.140
 the thickness of Haiti but still 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.010
 transposed the most beautiful is for central america we will talk about pt 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.280
 contrary to logic 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.500
 Certainly 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 an lcd tv 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.590
 with technology 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.710
 local kyodo where you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.299
 we eat the prognostics that you have the lighting of each client 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 individually local 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.930
 I think it's part of the trading floor the total package but the country cost 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.720
 Eventually, I'd like to have it but at the moment there is no proposal
