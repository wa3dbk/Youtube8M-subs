00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.109
 Hello i am still one of parental leave who are you i am for 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.310
 again from Fox Fox de 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.930
 what is behind it 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.809
 for a wrong the first job exchange for lateral entrants and that is for 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.649
 all people looking for new perspectives 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.060
 and newcomers what are the reasons why people change jobs? 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.689
 Newcomers are all those who have simply noticed that they are theirs 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.240
 Companies with their rejection procedures with their knowledge 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.730
 actually very much in other occupational fields 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.550
 and who can work the ring for business and become a new one 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.869
 Want to develop direction 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.940
 if I have the EM 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.200
 want to change my job and be a career changer 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.350
 I would like 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.830
 when do I have the best chance to get started so what talents eleven 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.230
 Men continue the most 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 So the most important thing is that you are aware of your talents 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.160
 and that you know where the strengths are, for example, whether you are very 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.289
 analytically talented chairman is creative and language talented 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.700
 and especially when it's not subject-specific 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.330
 Plan properties, then, such as analytical thinking then 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.610
 you have a very good chance Â»in other industries of robustness too 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.750
 slip in 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.450
 to be shown under possibilities 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.520
 that would have been all about different talents 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.290
 Michelbach can not be seen on his website with you 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.630
 Job he looks for set title but that of talent then 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.210
 is listed 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.450
 this works exactly right so the big difference is that i 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.830
 i said i completely dissolve myself from the industries and professional fields i do 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.180
 would like to give the job seeker the opportunity to companies 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.270
 Satisfied about the personality traits 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.550
 if anyone knows now scary analytically talented under can be very good 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.560
 count in the TuS holders II the category analytical thinking and if 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.210
 one trimmed one has indicated the jobs where the extreme is required 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.890
 and that opens up new perspectives for the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.280
 There were in the hands cross-industry 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.950
 to show possibilities 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.689
 which industries need the most current cross-users where it is 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.980
 highest demand 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.909
 So two very strong industries have the extremes 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.520
 search and newcomers very much like to accept that on the one hand the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.380
 for the care but also the other industry was me 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 really desperately looking for good part people 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.970
 underneath have increased very good chances if they do 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.929
 create the right package 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.279
 that could be newcomers 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.529
 then better than others so as people who were those in the profession 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.829
 have training or have studied so the big advantage 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.580
 from lateral climbers it came 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.170
 that they keep a tremendously high motivation in their new 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.610
 To prove profession in their new tasks 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.310
 if current studies in themselves 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.239
 then you always have Jahn Germany is only eleven percent of people people 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.270
 motivates to work really hard 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.590
 to stand up for their shop 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 and career changers are characterized by a high degree of motivation, they know where 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.749
 your strengths lie 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.249
 they are eager to learn and inquisitive and that's what Honda does in the company 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.389
 want to have employees 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.069
 that really 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.430
 behind the task, they can move something and that's a big one 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.539
 advantage 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.029
 that companies look at album 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.159
 I can understand that for many, many people are changing jobs 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.289
 also want to think about what we can do as a scam 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.519
 They will study unhappy they do not want to be in 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.619
 However, the work has already arrived at the companies 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.529
 that there are such people and they have arrived at the companies themselves 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.159
 can use well 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.279
 So it has arrived relatively well Germany is still a bit 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.689
 Hiding that happens a lot by accident or because the beginner 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.630
 really dare to apply to companies easily 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.519
 I would just like to take them under her and 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.780
 For example, good role models such as Lufthansa have been targeted for years 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:34.180
 looking for newcomers and I would like to work in other companies 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.340
 Possibility of exploiting this potential with ease 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.369
 future-oriented their employees optimize structures on the spot 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.900
 Being motivated together can not be the end 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.019
 Limits of my career choice are set 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.140
 One here is the feeling of the Zoch that I left one so the train departed 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.409
 that in this life, for example, I am going to be able to do prima ballerina at 8 o'clock 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.809
 you do not end up so all of them are so and what is close to power 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.980
 around 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.099
 So you have to say we have stopped in Germany already 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.580
 Bound jobs so the bus driver just does not become the pilot there 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.379
 that does not work but there are just so many professions in Germany 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.919
 they are not subject-specific 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.720
 and where, on the outside, you get the impression that they will be there 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:20.739
 not really he says 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.200
 There are already many possibilities if you know where your strengths are and 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.629
 what you do through study 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.780
 through life experience work experience 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.559
 and who is similar 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.859
 To see if the world has transferable capabilities I can 

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:34.020
 no other area 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.819
 And there are many possibilities and then you come to me 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.999
 then I also show these perspectives on the site 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:45.519
 Which industries currently need the most lateral entrants? 

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:49.179
 painted all industries but who heritage but pays fly and Haiti 

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:51.960
 Porsche are badly affected but also in the service area 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.039
 scary wanted 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.069
 there is also borsch 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.699
 to have the need for cross-climbers where one is not suspected so 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.189
 For example, the public service needs newcomers to the public sector 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.629
 Service is actually a good example we already have very many 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.689
 Newcomer because the blog light in the mostly non-subject 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:10.940
 Book because it's about here 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.220
 Administrative careers around Nora supporting services in the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.750
 public domain and for that it is not necessary to have the diploma x- 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.939
 y- in the bag 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.419
 but that one faces the task that brings a good experience 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.360
 and the good motivation to do that there are, for example, quite a few 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.589
 Possibilities Dr simply fell not so aware and yes at the 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.029
 Place m10 good chances 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.229
 so a few little ones stand around I'll get on with my job he's me 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.909
 actually rather businessman has no idea about the internet until recently 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.909
 I just thought about it now and saw in the year of the self 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.080
 Newcomers to the it industry 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.940
 yes, yes, I know what I speech AZ 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.800
 a like 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.139
 how did this cross-entry come about so what was yours? 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.470
 Motivation or did you have Regent's defining experience soldiers this is 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.599
 partly just came around I have the ITB last 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.399
 The thing I noticed was the last twelve years movie big 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.700
 German everyday group worked Euro 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.980
 The last two years have been spent in New Zealand 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.790
 and as they just mean the cross-entry transient as I want mine 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.600
 Employee structure is because you have seen 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.210
 almost 40 percent to newcomers 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.930
 and suddenly I want to have you back to Germany, you have to do something 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.110
 important i wipe i want to give people the opportunity here 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.590
 also 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.780
 as this is to be realized and the companies on the other side of this 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.599
 so scary potential of these motivated people use and salad 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.219
 the SuS to come alone through New Zealand into the device the idea here in 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.749
 Germany something to move apn thank you very much for that 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.609
 Infineon theirs the proportion of this microphone belongs to thanks epd 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:47.209
 but
