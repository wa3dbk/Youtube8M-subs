see<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> little<00:00:49.739> signs<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.070> everything<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
see a little signs on everything is the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
see a little signs on everything is the
main<00:00:51.780> room<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.410> doesn't<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.950> anything<00:00:53.129> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
main room which doesn't have anything in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
main room which doesn't have anything in
it<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.640> whatever<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:55.110> elevator<00:00:55.320> yeah<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it but whatever so the elevator yeah I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
it but whatever so the elevator yeah I
think<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> older<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.660> goes<00:00:57.870> all

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
think it's the older and that goes all

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.209 
think it's the older and that goes all
the<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.110> up<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.500> guess<00:00:58.739> he<00:00:58.860> hasn't<00:00:58.980> really

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the way up I guess he hasn't really

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220 
the way up I guess he hasn't really
thought<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.610> way<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> make<00:01:00.750> an<00:01:00.870> elevator

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
thought of a way to make an elevator

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
thought of a way to make an elevator
since<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:02.160> not<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> Minecraft<00:01:02.760> yet<00:01:02.910> but

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
since that's not a Minecraft yet but

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
since that's not a Minecraft yet but
yeah<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.280> look<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> floor

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
yeah we can go up and look at the floor

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
yeah we can go up and look at the floor
so<00:01:05.789> each<00:01:05.910> floor<00:01:06.149> looks<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.509> same<00:01:06.660> as<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> see

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so each floor looks the same as you see

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.779 
so each floor looks the same as you see
when<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.590> above<00:01:07.800> them<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.670> all

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
when I'm going above them all they all

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.109 
when I'm going above them all they all
pretty<00:01:09.000> much<00:01:09.119> look<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> same<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.119> go

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pretty much look the same if we just go

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.260 
pretty much look the same if we just go
in<00:01:12.240> each<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.050> have<00:01:13.259> a<00:01:13.590> room<00:01:14.270> nice

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
identical and this just goes up the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.310 
identical and this just goes up the
entire<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.329> balconies<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.990> both<00:01:58.140> of

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
pretty much I want to take a look at

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.500 
pretty much I want to take a look at
this<00:02:56.549> one<00:02:56.700> because<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> tallest

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this one because it's the tallest

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
building in the city and it's almost

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.559 
building in the city and it's almost
abstract<00:02:59.519> but<00:02:59.879> it<00:02:59.999> goes<00:03:00.090> right<00:03:00.299> along<00:03:00.389> the

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
abstract but it goes right along the

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.569 
abstract but it goes right along the
river<00:03:00.749> and<00:03:01.139> yeah<00:03:01.889> the<00:03:02.069> buildings<00:03:02.370> are<00:03:02.459> all

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
river and yeah the buildings are all

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.809 
river and yeah the buildings are all
pretty<00:03:02.849> they're<00:03:03.269> pretty<00:03:03.299> similar<00:03:04.139> but<00:03:05.069> at<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
pretty they're pretty similar but at the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.099 
pretty they're pretty similar but at the
same<00:03:05.969> time<00:03:06.150> they're<00:03:06.329> very<00:03:06.359> cool<00:03:06.689> in<00:03:06.900> fact

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
same time they're very cool in fact

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.080 
same time they're very cool in fact
they're<00:03:07.500> abstract<00:03:08.459> they<00:03:08.639> have<00:03:08.760> different

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
they're abstract they have different

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.459 
they're abstract they have different
colors<00:03:09.419> but<00:03:10.169> they're<00:03:10.439> also<00:03:10.620> very<00:03:10.799> rectangular

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
colors but they're also very rectangular

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.559 
colors but they're also very rectangular
there's<00:03:13.469> not<00:03:13.620> much<00:03:13.829> diversity<00:03:14.699> wants<00:03:15.389> them

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
there's not much diversity wants them

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.619 
there's not much diversity wants them
but<00:03:15.870> aware<00:03:16.530> they're<00:03:16.680> huge<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:18.060> very<00:03:18.449> nice
