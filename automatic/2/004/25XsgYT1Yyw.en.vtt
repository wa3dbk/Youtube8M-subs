standard 2.5 inch SSD and again 256
gigabytes<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.779> will<00:00:19.529> operate<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> say

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
gigabytes it will operate on the say

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640 
gigabytes it will operate on the say
that<00:00:20.580> revision<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.300> bus<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> three

gigabits per second maximum transfer

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
gigabits per second maximum transfer
speed<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.699> actually<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.570> plug<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.900> into

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
speed so actually you can plug this into

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380 
speed so actually you can plug this into
say<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> say<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> rev<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> seder<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.179> three

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390

port<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.380> recommend<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.160> SATA<00:00:32.399> Rev

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
port I would not recommend a SATA Rev

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
port I would not recommend a SATA Rev
one<00:00:32.790> port<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.510> limit<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
one port because that will limit the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.200 
one port because that will limit the
drives<00:00:34.920> performance<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> can't<00:00:35.910> plug<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
drives performance but you can't plug it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
drives performance but you can't plug it
into<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> state<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:36.750> f3<00:00:36.930> port<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.440> you'll<00:00:38.070> still

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
into a state or f3 port and you'll still

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
into a state or f3 port and you'll still
have<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> bandwidth<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> state<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:39.809> f2

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
have all the bandwidth of state or f2

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.170 
have all the bandwidth of state or f2
plus<00:00:40.170> some<00:00:40.680> additional<00:00:40.739> overhead<00:00:41.309> I'll<00:00:41.910> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
plus some additional overhead I'll so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
plus some additional overhead I'll so
you<00:00:42.239> get<00:00:42.360> some<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> sort<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> general

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you get some of the sort of general

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
you get some of the sort of general

software so if you're migrating from an
old<00:00:56.010> system<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.440> tandem

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
old system you can use that in tandem

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
old system you can use that in tandem

molex power cables now verbatim has some
interesting<00:01:08.850> nomenclature<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.869> they're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
interesting nomenclature that they're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
interesting nomenclature that they're
using<00:01:10.530> by<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.100> here's<00:01:11.310> sort<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.729> the

using by the way here's sort of all the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780 
using by the way here's sort of all the
detailed<00:01:12.210> specs<00:01:12.740> but<00:01:13.740> verbatim<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.670> their

detailed specs but verbatim for their
actual<00:01:15.180> products<00:01:15.630> use<00:01:16.200> sku<00:01:16.799> number<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
actual products use sku number so if you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
actual products use sku number so if you
want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.820> what's<00:01:18.150> specific<00:01:19.020> SSD<00:01:19.500> you're

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
are the screws you can remove if you

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.180 
are the screws you can remove if you

bear that in mind that has a bit of a
textured<00:03:48.330> finish<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.380> see<00:03:49.590> here

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
textured finish so as you can see here

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.310 
textured finish so as you can see here
on<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> back<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:51.540> got<00:03:51.690> sort<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.959> nice<00:03:52.110> feel

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
on the back it's got sort of a nice feel

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.710 
on the back it's got sort of a nice feel
to<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.530> stays<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> matte<00:03:53.880> black<00:03:54.150> color<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:54.690> it

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
to it stays a matte black color so it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.280 
to it stays a matte black color so it
should<00:03:55.019> match<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.650> most<00:03:57.050> components<00:03:58.050> that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
should match with most components that

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.540 
should match with most components that
you<00:03:58.380> might<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.650> your<00:03:58.830> computer<00:03:59.070> case<00:03:59.340> and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
you might have in your computer case and

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.280 
you might have in your computer case and
of<00:03:59.610> course<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.940> get<00:04:00.060> standard<00:04:00.510> 2.5<00:04:01.050> inch

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
of course you get standard 2.5 inch

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.440 
of course you get standard 2.5 inch

we can get out of this Drive here's a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.760 
we can get out of this Drive here's a
quick<00:04:21.660> look<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.020> first<00:04:22.320> page<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.620> our

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
quick look at the first page of our

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.529 
quick look at the first page of our
benchmarks<00:04:23.640> there's<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.820> lot<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:23.970> information

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
benchmarks there's a lot of information

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.060 
benchmarks there's a lot of information
here<00:04:24.570> because<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:24.960> also<00:04:25.110> have<00:04:25.410> all<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> system

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
here because I also have all the system

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.760 
here because I also have all the system
info<00:04:26.340> up<00:04:26.460> on<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
info up on the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.920 
info up on the
one<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.699> you<00:04:27.789> might<00:04:28.120> notice<00:04:28.330> for<00:04:28.599> instance

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
one so you might notice for instance

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.540 
one so you might notice for instance
that<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> 4matic<00:04:29.530> capacity<00:04:30.009> of<00:04:30.069> the<00:04:30.129> drive<00:04:30.310> is

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
that the 4matic capacity of the drive is

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.839 
that the 4matic capacity of the drive is
238<00:04:31.270> gigabytes<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.889> is<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.460> usable

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
238 gigabytes so that is the usable

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.249 
238 gigabytes so that is the usable
space<00:04:33.940> after<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.449> dr<00:04:34.629> actually<00:04:35.169> been

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
space after the dr actually been

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.379 
space after the dr actually been
formatted<00:04:35.590> also<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.490> controller<00:04:36.909> that<00:04:37.210> we're

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
formatted also the controller that we're

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.950 
formatted also the controller that we're
using<00:04:37.479> on<00:04:37.629> this<00:04:37.720> drive<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.259> face<00:04:38.500> on<00:04:38.710> ps3

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
using on this drive is the face on ps3

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.830 
using on this drive is the face on ps3
108<00:04:41.039> so<00:04:42.039> this<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.430> our<00:04:42.819> crystal<00:04:43.300> dis<00:04:43.479> mark

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
108 so this is our crystal dis mark

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.320 
108 so this is our crystal dis mark
bench<00:04:44.139> bench<00:04:44.650> mark<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:45.759> is<00:04:45.909> running<00:04:46.210> in

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
bench bench mark and this is running in

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.089

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
average of five runs here so on the left

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.570 
average of five runs here so on the left
side<00:04:52.659> we<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:52.900> see<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.110> detailed<00:04:53.500> results<00:04:54.280> so

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
side we can see the detailed results so

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.219 
side we can see the detailed results so

this<00:04:58.810> test<00:04:59.110> bear<00:04:59.289> in<00:04:59.380> mind<00:04:59.500> this<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.740> a<00:05:00.099> random

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
this test bear in mind this is a random

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.180 
this test bear in mind this is a random
data<00:05:00.880> test<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:02.199> essentially<00:05:03.009> it<00:05:03.159> is

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
data test so essentially it is

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.909 
data test so essentially it is
incompressible<00:05:03.759> data<00:05:04.060> that's<00:05:04.419> being<00:05:04.919> written

this<00:05:44.080> with<00:05:44.440> compressible<00:05:45.130> data<00:05:45.190> so

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
this with compressible data so

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.269 
this with compressible data so
difference<00:05:46.599> here<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:47.110> between<00:05:47.680> compressible

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.950 
difference here is between compressible
and<00:05:48.460> incompressible<00:05:48.580> data<00:05:49.150> is<00:05:49.509> that<00:05:49.840> on<00:05:49.930> the

fly the drive controller can actually
compress<00:05:51.819> that<00:05:51.849> data<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.360> basically<00:05:53.319> do

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
compress that data and basically do

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.800 
compress that data and basically do

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
faster reads and writes performance so

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.659 
faster reads and writes performance so
