00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
which all you have to do is really just

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.170 
which all you have to do is really just
whoo<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:13.690> unplug<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.730> pic<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.850> back<00:02:16.000> in

whoo just unplug that pic it back in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.080 
whoo just unplug that pic it back in
sideways<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.580> takes<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.790> tab

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
sideways like this takes a little tab

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.810 
sideways like this takes a little tab
flip<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.480> down<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.410> then<00:02:21.100> take<00:02:21.580> all<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
flip it down and then take all the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.290 
flip it down and then take all the
handles<00:02:22.180> apartment<00:02:22.930> do<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
handles apartment do this that's the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.550 
handles apartment do this that's the
beam<00:02:25.450> rifle<00:02:25.810> mode<00:02:25.989> which<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:28.080> think<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.290> doesn't

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
beam rifle mode which I think it doesn't

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.110 
beam rifle mode which I think it doesn't
really<00:02:29.830> do<00:02:30.040> much<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.430> doesn't<00:02:30.670> look<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
really do much it doesn't look like it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.940 
really do much it doesn't look like it
does<00:02:31.269> much<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.780> doesn't<00:02:32.140> look<00:02:32.200> bad<00:02:32.260> imposing

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
does much it doesn't look bad imposing

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.580 
does much it doesn't look bad imposing
it<00:02:33.370> looks<00:02:33.550> kind<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:33.880> ridiculous<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:35.470> like

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it looks kind of ridiculous just like

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.320 
it looks kind of ridiculous just like
face<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:37.180> do<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.269> see<00:02:37.420> nothing<00:02:39.060> anyway<00:02:40.060> then

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
face what do you see nothing anyway then

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.000 
face what do you see nothing anyway then
it<00:02:40.450> also<00:02:40.570> comes<00:02:40.930> with<00:02:41.019> these<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.530> be<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:41.920> effect

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
it also comes with these to be in effect

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.479 
it also comes with these to be in effect
parts<00:02:42.489> which<00:02:43.209> are<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.920> jeans<00:02:44.920> or<00:02:45.070> two<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
parts which are for the jeans or two and

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.850 
parts which are for the jeans or two and
you<00:02:45.550> just<00:02:45.820> take<00:02:46.060> them<00:02:46.269> took<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.290> gaps<00:02:47.500> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
you just take them took the gaps and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.390 
you just take them took the gaps and
then<00:02:47.980> they're<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.310> fit<00:02:48.519> into<00:02:48.640> those

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
then they're going to fit into those

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.420 
then they're going to fit into those
whatever<00:02:51.400> right<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.090> like<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:53.430> and

the<00:04:15.040> beam<00:04:15.700> saber<00:04:16.030> beams<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.170> come<00:04:17.290> with

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
the beam saber beams that come with

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.810 
the beam saber beams that come with
Cheerios<00:04:17.830> or<00:04:19.170> Seraphim<00:04:20.170> or<00:04:20.410> whatever<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.640> I

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
Cheerios or Seraphim or whatever so I I

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.460 
Cheerios or Seraphim or whatever so I I
don't<00:04:22.300> know<00:04:22.450> they<00:04:22.630> just<00:04:22.660> took<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.170> lot<00:04:23.320> longer

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
don't know they just took a lot longer

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.830 
don't know they just took a lot longer
than<00:04:23.740> than<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.310> other<00:04:24.460> ones<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.760> meet<00:04:24.940> again

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
than than the other ones to meet again

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.780 
than than the other ones to meet again
with<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.110> longevity<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.980> then<00:04:27.340> now<00:04:27.520> we<00:04:27.580> have

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
with the longevity and then now we have

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.520 
with the longevity and then now we have
the<00:04:27.880> last<00:04:28.090> part<00:04:28.390> chance<00:04:28.810> or<00:04:29.020> three<00:04:29.320> which<00:04:29.500> is

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
the last part chance or three which is

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.080 
the last part chance or three which is
probably<00:04:29.919> why<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> lot<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.640> people<00:04:30.760> are<00:04:31.000> going

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
probably why a lot of people are going

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.090 
probably why a lot of people are going
to<00:04:31.180> get<00:04:31.270> this<00:04:31.390> kit<00:04:31.690> regardless<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.740> his<00:04:32.860> Trans

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
to get this kit regardless of his Trans

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.330 
to get this kit regardless of his Trans
Am<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.310> mean<00:04:33.550> look<00:04:33.700> at<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.880> clear<00:04:34.150> green<00:04:34.330> part

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
Am I mean look at that clear green part

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.950 
Am I mean look at that clear green part
and<00:04:36.340> then<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.550> can<00:04:36.850> convert<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.690> beam

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and then you can convert it to the beam

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.080 
and then you can convert it to the beam
rifle<00:04:38.470> mode<00:04:40.950> or<00:04:41.950> it's<00:04:42.310> not<00:04:42.400> even<00:04:42.669> like<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.790> beam

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
rifle mode or it's not even like a beam

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.760 
rifle mode or it's not even like a beam
rifle<00:04:43.450> once<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.690> goes<00:04:43.750> into<00:04:43.960> transline<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.590> one

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
rifle once it goes into transline is one

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.970 
rifle once it goes into transline is one
of<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.950> bus<00:04:45.160> terminal<00:04:46.350> all<00:04:47.350> right<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.770> doesn't

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
of the bus terminal all right it doesn't

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.030 
of the bus terminal all right it doesn't
go<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.370> as<00:04:48.550> easy<00:04:48.760> as<00:04:48.970> exia<00:04:49.680> maybe<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.800> little

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
go on as easy as exia maybe a little

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.010 
go on as easy as exia maybe a little
easier<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:51.580> then<00:04:51.730> you<00:04:52.330> don't<00:04:52.480> want<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.690> when

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
easier but then you don't want it when

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.850 
easier but then you don't want it when
it's<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.320> there<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.580> very<00:04:54.580> secure<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:56.650> you

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
it's in there it's very secure so you

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.200 
it's in there it's very secure so you
flip<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.310> out<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.669> then<00:04:57.730> it's<00:04:57.910> back<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:58.180> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
flip this out and then it's back in the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.560 
flip this out and then it's back in the
sword<00:04:58.450> mode<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:59.520> then<00:05:02.100> gets<00:05:03.100> even<00:05:03.370> better<00:05:03.570> ok

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
sword mode and then gets even better ok

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.540 
sword mode and then gets even better ok
so<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:04.870> beam<00:05:05.350> part<00:05:05.680> that's<00:05:06.130> going<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.400> go<00:05:06.520> on

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
so this beam part that's going to go on

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.360 
so this beam part that's going to go on
to<00:05:06.820> this<00:05:07.620> there's<00:05:08.620> only<00:05:08.710> one<00:05:08.919> way<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.130> put<00:05:09.310> it

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
to this there's only one way to put it

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.340 
to this there's only one way to put it
or<00:05:09.640> actually<00:05:09.880> two<00:05:10.210> ways<00:05:10.330> depending<00:05:10.810> on<00:05:10.930> you

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
or actually two ways depending on you

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.770 
or actually two ways depending on you
know<00:05:12.660> there's<00:05:13.660> two<00:05:13.780> ways<00:05:13.930> that'll<00:05:14.230> go<00:05:14.500> in

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
know there's two ways that'll go in

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.600 
know there's two ways that'll go in
though<00:05:16.780> these<00:05:17.140> four<00:05:17.710> pegs<00:05:17.950> are<00:05:18.220> going<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.490> go

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
though these four pegs are going to go

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.970 
though these four pegs are going to go
on<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> sides<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.750> then<00:05:19.960> let's<00:05:20.680> take<00:05:20.890> it

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
on to the sides and then let's take it

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.730 
on to the sides and then let's take it
from<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.130> top<00:05:21.220> like<00:05:21.520> this<00:05:22.470> I'm<00:05:23.470> going<00:05:23.680> to

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
from the top like this I'm going to

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.409 
from the top like this I'm going to
slide<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.310> from<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:24.610> top

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
slide it from the top

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:33.680 
slide it from the top
and<00:05:27.419> you<00:05:27.629> plug<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.199> in<00:05:32.300> make<00:05:33.300> sure<00:05:33.330> all<00:05:33.539> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690

and you plug it in make sure all the
pigs<00:05:33.930> are<00:05:34.139> in<00:05:34.289> there<00:05:34.500> you<00:05:35.129> plug<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.550> in<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.930> now

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
pigs are in there you plug it in and now

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.210 
pigs are in there you plug it in and now

review<00:06:02.580> hopefully<00:06:04.639> yeah<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.789> difference<00:06:06.090> is

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
review hopefully yeah the difference is

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.730 
review hopefully yeah the difference is
between<00:06:06.210> those<00:06:06.659> besides<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.050> obvious<00:06:07.169> colors

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
between those besides the obvious colors

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.010 
between those besides the obvious colors
is<00:06:07.979> you<00:06:08.639> know<00:06:08.759> if<00:06:08.880> you<00:06:09.030> have<00:06:09.210> two<00:06:09.659> original

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
is you know if you have two original

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.020 
is you know if you have two original
kits<00:06:10.319> or<00:06:10.620> whatever<00:06:10.949> obviously<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:11.729> colors

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
kits or whatever obviously the colors

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.809 
kits or whatever obviously the colors
the<00:06:12.210> color<00:06:12.810> difference<00:06:13.050> is<00:06:13.380> you<00:06:13.979> know<00:06:14.099> it<00:06:14.669> may

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
the color difference is you know it may

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.339 
the color difference is you know it may
just<00:06:14.849> be<00:06:15.090> different<00:06:15.389> color<00:06:15.539> but<00:06:15.780> it's

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
just be different color but it's
