00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.090
 third place where we explain technology in terms that all the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.980
 world understands on that occasion we will be talking about two of the main 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.509
 phones in the market 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.489
 and the player 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:19.320
 the basic question robert that is better an iphone today a beach and good after 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.509
 of deliberately using the two for a period of time 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.990
 I have several conclusions but before entering it I know that many go to 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.009
 write wondering about the new year so I clarified yet not what 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.100
 I have why I can not comment on 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.000
 let's go on 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.520
 the good things of the iphone like all good napout the design is spectacular 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.970
 the operating system has enough locations and if you want more it is very 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.050
 Easy to synchronize the screen is great and you can watch videos in good size 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.930
 ideal for people who are interested in entertainment, which is not very good 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.070
 is that it does not have a physical keyboard the screen is fragile and if the city is not 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.180
 will destroy you in the first fall you need a manual anhalt contract 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.780
 two years and it is not ergonomic and it does not adapt very well when using 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.100
 the valverde is excellent compact with the keyboard i because it is physical and has 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 internet available just like the iphone 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.050
 Excellent email handling resists many drops and is ideal for 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.290
 the people who in handling more business 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.370
 the bad thing is that it is limited in the use of bad video to synchronize with your 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.300
 calendar if you do not have a server of your company 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.120
 i the screen is very small plus the applications are not enough 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.950
 if I am a guy who wants to answer an email immediately add it to me 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.270
 agenda and doing a business is with one hand 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.700
 in the street the blackberry that is much faster is just great 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.110
 yes i'm interested in seeing photos send videos take pictures use 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.640
 facebook uploading things to the internet the iphone has no competitor there what 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 you have roughly the two differences at the end as always the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 answer is in you see you soon complained the link of the week phase 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.360
 of the accident may the technology is in your hands use it well
