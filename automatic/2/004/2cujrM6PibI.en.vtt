00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.930 
think it's the warmness of my fingers or
something<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.099> now<00:02:23.250> there's<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> little<00:02:23.610> teal

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
something but now there's a little teal

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.259 
something but now there's a little teal
there<00:02:24.260> which<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.410> perfectly<00:02:25.860> 80s<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.819> feel

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
there which is perfectly 80s so I feel

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.479 
there which is perfectly 80s so I feel
like<00:02:27.299> when<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:28.170> wore<00:02:28.470> bright<00:02:28.769> colors<00:02:29.250> like

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
like when they wore bright colors like

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.130 
like when they wore bright colors like
this<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:30.690> did<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.680> eyeliner<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.140> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
this they did not use eyeliner so I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830 
this they did not use eyeliner so I
think<00:02:34.290> I'm<00:02:34.739> not<00:02:35.010> gonna<00:02:35.370> use<00:02:35.790> any<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.720> know
