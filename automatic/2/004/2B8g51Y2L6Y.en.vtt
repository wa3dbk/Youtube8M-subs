everyone<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:21.080> let<00:02:21.230> me<00:02:21.260> fast-forward<00:02:21.740> through

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
everyone so let me fast-forward through

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.010 
everyone so let me fast-forward through
all<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.760> that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.670 

it<00:02:28.770> eventually<00:02:29.070> finished<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.230> now<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> game

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
it eventually finished and now the game

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it eventually finished and now the game
is<00:02:31.710> loading<00:02:31.980> up<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:43.250> I'm<00:02:44.250> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.490> show<00:02:44.640> you

is loading up now I'm going to show you
a<00:02:44.820> little<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.420> gameplay<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.080> get<00:02:46.440> an<00:02:46.560> idea

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
a little bit of gameplay see get an idea

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.370 
a little bit of gameplay see get an idea
of<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.700> all<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.000> looks<00:02:48.270> like<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:49.230> how

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
of what all that looks like and see how

00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:01.790 
of what all that looks like and see how
it<00:02:49.560> runs<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.480> see<00:03:00.620> there's<00:03:01.620> some

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
it runs now as you can see there's some

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.240 
it runs now as you can see there's some
noise<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.360> visuals<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.020> I've<00:03:04.740> tried

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
noise in the visuals and I've tried

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.730 
noise in the visuals and I've tried
everything<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.420> get<00:03:06.540> rid<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.900> I've<00:03:07.440> tried

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
everything to get rid of it I've tried

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.380 
everything to get rid of it I've tried
messing<00:03:08.100> around<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.610> settings<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.300> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
messing around in the settings on the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.530 
messing around in the settings on the
console<00:03:09.800> I've<00:03:10.800> tried<00:03:10.950> different<00:03:11.250> hdmi<00:03:12.030> cables

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
console I've tried different hdmi cables

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.620 
console I've tried different hdmi cables
and<00:03:12.990> I've<00:03:13.860> tried<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:15.120> playing<00:03:15.360> with<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and I've tried just playing with the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.440 
and I've tried just playing with the
settings<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.230> TV<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:17.120> nothing<00:03:18.120> will

settings on the TV but nothing will

eliminate that noise in Tyler there are

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.490 
eliminate that noise in Tyler there are
things<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.630> little<00:03:21.840> tricks<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.470> can

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
things you can do little tricks that can

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.430 
things you can do little tricks that can
smooth<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.820> little<00:03:24.090> bit<00:03:24.300> like<00:03:24.600> turning

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
smooth it out a little bit like turning

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470 
smooth it out a little bit like turning
the<00:03:25.590> sharpness<00:03:25.950> down<00:03:26.340> will<00:03:26.580> smooth<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.120> lot<00:03:27.300> of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
the sharpness down will smooth a lot of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.410 
the sharpness down will smooth a lot of
that<00:03:28.130> if<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.520> have<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.620> digital<00:03:31.620> noise<00:03:32.040> removal

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
that if you have a digital noise removal

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.210 
that if you have a digital noise removal
on<00:03:33.420> your<00:03:33.810> TV<00:03:34.020> activating<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.070> putting

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
on your TV activating that and putting

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.480 
on your TV activating that and putting
it<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.520> high<00:03:35.850> will<00:03:36.240> also<00:03:36.630> help<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.830> chances

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
it on high will also help but chances

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.040 
it on high will also help but chances
are<00:03:38.610> you've<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.940> your<00:03:39.090> TV<00:03:39.420> set<00:03:39.660> up<00:03:39.840> how<00:03:39.990> you

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
are you've got your TV set up how you

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.140 
are you've got your TV set up how you
like<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:41.130> running<00:03:41.340> well<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:41.760> Xbox

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
like it and it's running well with Xbox

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.590 
like it and it's running well with Xbox
one<00:03:42.360> already<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:44.040> get<00:03:44.730> why<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.180> wouldn't

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
one already so I get why you wouldn't

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.570 
one already so I get why you wouldn't
necessarily<00:03:45.959> want<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.680> change<00:03:46.920> any<00:03:47.100> settings

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
necessarily want to change any settings

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.210 
necessarily want to change any settings
just<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.180> smooth<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.540> out<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.930> did<00:03:49.709> compare<00:03:50.100> it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
just to smooth it out I did compare it

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.340 
just to smooth it out I did compare it
with<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> 360<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.630> I'll<00:03:51.959> show<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.170> that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
with the 360 and I'll show you that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.170 
with the 360 and I'll show you that
footage<00:03:52.770> now

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.789 

and<00:03:59.219> as<00:04:00.219> you<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.609> see<00:04:00.640> it's<00:04:01.180> much<00:04:01.659> smoother<00:04:02.349> on

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
and as you can see it's much smoother on

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.569 
and as you can see it's much smoother on
the<00:04:03.340> xbox<00:04:03.730> 360<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:05.170> that's<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.859> shame<00:04:06.129> this<00:04:06.430> is

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
the xbox 360 so that's a shame this is

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.940 
the xbox 360 so that's a shame this is
clearly<00:04:06.879> a<00:04:07.150> problem<00:04:07.840> with<00:04:08.079> how<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.319> xbox<00:04:08.769> one

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
clearly a problem with how the xbox one

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.360 
clearly a problem with how the xbox one
renders<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:10.359> older<00:04:10.629> 360<00:04:11.109> games<00:04:11.409> this<00:04:11.799> could

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
renders the older 360 games this could

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.839 
renders the older 360 games this could
be<00:04:12.579> something<00:04:12.909> that<00:04:13.329> is<00:04:13.709> fixed<00:04:14.709> in<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.549> coming

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
be something that is fixed in the coming

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.150 
be something that is fixed in the coming
months<00:04:16.150> we<00:04:16.840> may<00:04:17.139> have<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.410> wait<00:04:17.709> until<00:04:17.949> it

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
months we may have to wait until it

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.939 
months we may have to wait until it
rolls<00:04:18.370> out<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:18.850> full<00:04:19.470> when<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.590> rolls<00:04:20.769> out<00:04:20.919> to

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
rolls out in full when it rolls out to

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.100 
rolls out in full when it rolls out to
everyone<00:04:21.489> we<00:04:21.759> might<00:04:21.940> then<00:04:22.150> have<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.539> fix<00:04:22.840> for

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
everyone we might then have this fix for

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.409 
everyone we might then have this fix for
this<00:04:23.169> visual<00:04:23.889> oddity<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.030> never<00:04:25.180> know<00:04:25.300> we

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
this visual oddity but you never know we

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.960 
this visual oddity but you never know we
might<00:04:25.539> get<00:04:25.690> lucky<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.080> see<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> patch<00:04:27.340> sooner

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
might get lucky and see a patch sooner

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.040 
might get lucky and see a patch sooner
and<00:04:28.150> when<00:04:28.930> Windows<00:04:29.380> 10<00:04:29.770> rolls<00:04:30.550> out<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.870> never

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
and when Windows 10 rolls out you never

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.170 
and when Windows 10 rolls out you never
know<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.229> might<00:04:32.740> fix<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.550> problem<00:04:33.910> as<00:04:34.030> well

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
know that might fix the problem as well

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:44.980 
know that might fix the problem as well
so<00:04:34.560> we<00:04:35.560> will<00:04:35.770> see

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.800 

ice<00:04:45.470> cream

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.280 

now<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.840> had<00:04:50.470> an<00:04:50.740> idea<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.750> cunning<00:04:52.750> plan<00:04:52.780> if<00:04:53.260> you

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
now I had an idea a cunning plan if you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.570 
now I had an idea a cunning plan if you
will<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:54.610> i<00:04:54.639> logged<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.150> my<00:04:55.419> 360<00:04:56.220> went<00:04:57.220> over

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
will so i logged on to my 360 went over

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.110 
will so i logged on to my 360 went over
to<00:04:57.790> my<00:04:58.240> save<00:04:58.690> file<00:04:58.990> for<00:04:59.290> mass<00:04:59.440> effect<00:04:59.830> and

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
to my save file for mass effect and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.280 
to my save file for mass effect and
transferred<00:05:01.120> my<00:05:01.360> save<00:05:01.630> files<00:05:01.930> onto<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:03.220> cloud

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290

might<00:05:35.590> be<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.800> problem<00:05:36.580> that's<00:05:36.970> fixed<00:05:37.419> in<00:05:37.510> the

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
might be a problem that's fixed in the

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.320 
might be a problem that's fixed in the
future<00:05:38.050> or<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:39.070> might<00:05:39.250> just<00:05:39.460> be<00:05:39.700> one<00:05:40.150> of<00:05:40.240> those

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
future or it might just be one of those

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.030 
future or it might just be one of those
minor<00:05:40.690> things<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.320> we<00:05:41.410> have<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:41.710> deal<00:05:41.740> with

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
minor things that we have to deal with

00:05:42.040 --> 00:06:24.910 
minor things that we have to deal with
keeping<00:05:42.910> 360<00:05:43.479> disks<00:05:43.840> around<00:05:43.960> still

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.940 

you

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.700 

so<00:06:32.160> as<00:06:32.430> you<00:06:32.580> can<00:06:32.730> see<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.930> didn't<00:06:34.290> load<00:06:34.470> up

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
so as you can see it didn't load up

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.320 
so as you can see it didn't load up
because<00:06:35.610> of<00:06:35.880> missing<00:06:36.300> DLC<00:06:36.900> so<00:06:37.650> these<00:06:38.330> games

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
because of missing DLC so these games

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.450 
because of missing DLC so these games
once<00:06:39.750> they're<00:06:39.930> downloaded<00:06:40.440> onto<00:06:40.560> Xbox<00:06:40.980> one<00:06:41.190> so

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
once they're downloaded onto Xbox one so

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.060 
once they're downloaded onto Xbox one so
far<00:06:41.670> it<00:06:41.850> seems<00:06:41.880> are<00:06:42.720> just<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.680> vanilla

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
far it seems are just the vanilla

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.850 
far it seems are just the vanilla
version<00:06:44.370> of<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:45.030> game<00:06:45.500> so<00:06:46.500> that's

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
version of the game so that's

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.290 
version of the game so that's
disappointing<00:06:50.300> and<00:06:52.550> that's<00:06:53.550> backwards

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
disappointing and that's backwards

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.720 
disappointing and that's backwards
compatibility<00:06:55.080> on<00:06:55.230> the<00:06:55.350> Xbox<00:06:55.740> one<00:06:55.980> at<00:06:56.550> the

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
compatibility on the Xbox one at the

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.630 
compatibility on the Xbox one at the
moment<00:06:57.030> there's<00:06:57.240> a<00:06:57.300> handful<00:06:58.020> of<00:06:58.050> games<00:06:58.640> which

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
moment there's a handful of games which

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.450 
moment there's a handful of games which
I<00:06:59.940> will<00:07:00.240> list<00:07:00.480> for<00:07:00.720> you<00:07:00.900> on<00:07:01.080> the<00:07:01.290> post<00:07:01.530> where
