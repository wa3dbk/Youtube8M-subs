00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 it's multiplayer time at the gamepro 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.400
 and I have the heiko and the tobi 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.980
 caught and we play against each other 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.719
 great smash bros for the view somehow 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.509
 you have to clear the first measure beer pick 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.580
 I have to choose the right ability 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 me here for sonic because i have that im 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.670
 test already played all the time and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 with whom I come reasonably well clear 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.650
 I'm completely full of praise and will 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.000
 that's why I play meta knight because of me 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.199
 not on the judgment of the colleagues 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.240
 leave that one anyway 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.080
 Maybe I have a chance and I will 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.120
 Kirby because I'm with the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.890
 first smash brothers on the n64 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.520
 really rocked and I hope that the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.070
 still as good as it used to be 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.820
 deep to begin by getting away where I in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.320
 the mainstage estate is looking for exit 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.460
 hero gave me a lot of fun 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.219
 also cool it again as to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 do not know when the topics stop 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.850
 happens exactly that gives both stage is 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 the already known from brühl and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.719
 share other smash bros and 0 as well 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 There are still gast character there feel 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.180
 I also go home immediately 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.479
 hide something with racing game 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.479
 to do 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 I met him and I have 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.619
 no idea what that does but me 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.619
 I just collected it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.180
 fire flower out of the way and I have 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 no idea what happened to her and he has 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.990
 someone somehow animal 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.990
 rooted says killed yourself 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.070
 i want this right next to the page 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.070
 and I did that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 I think I have just that that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.780
 girlfriend syndrome I have no idea 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.729
 what I do but somehow seems 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.490
 to work through anyway 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.659
 wants button mashing but of course wants 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.250
 I would give you the right professional 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.290
 Do not play like my colleagues did 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.640
 no chance 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.590
 yes this is of course right here 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.920
 you get into a smash 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.840
 bros 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.310
 you have to get back to this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.259
 get used to the numbering principle 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.880
 always if somehow the numbers there 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.440
 go down over 100 then that is 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 Probably quite big out of the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.599
 Screen from scratches is exactly that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 percent display and lecturer display the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.590
 Probably that you that you him 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.020
 fly out and that's it too 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.069
 what it is about 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.020
 if you throw somebody out you get 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.830
 points for it if you yourself 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
 is thrown out student is 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.080
 I have a fire sword 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.709
 no more 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.900
 I still have it. I got it meta 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.150
 Knight you're at 119 I feel 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.580
 like Luke Skywalker I felt like 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.590
 Luke Skywalker for a short second 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.090
 a character lost from sight and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.100
 I'm super g in the abyss 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.890
 practiced up there otherwise I would write 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:07.269
 you do not have anyway with past 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:13.989
 104 equal points and then there is virtually 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:19.480
 son of the thing and I'm the first of 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:22.150
 they have an extremely established that 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.739
 stock like curry upload technically very 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.109
 it is yes but it can be internet 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.600
 okay, we are indeed the points 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.850
 but I have one I met the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.970
 he is 123 is still great 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.859
 divided you find and prove it 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.950
 obviously it just yet on 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.079
 yes, the game has only come from 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.780
 good luck against each other 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.510
 with the whole drops with the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.340
 You can also come medieval 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.230
 beautifully personalize as well 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.459
 namely but mistaken that's the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.040
 Amazing that he is exactly like Mario 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.329
 kart itself you would have completely on 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.170
 the scarf gets in good German said 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.340
 now that's taken now I wanted 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.019
 actually I wanted that again 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.549
 back he wanted to sew on that 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.590
 and yes he has my character 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.459
 the prospect on the internet already sorry or 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.580
 soja stop that is not so I like 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.389
 it ganondorf angry come here computer 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.009
 image 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.419
 what with do it yourself on principle always 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.879
 already and ghana village at the start 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.080
 or do you think this increases your chances for 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.509
 maybe a little bit more 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.560
 Home and it inspires me because you 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.060
 horst takers wanted to be here myself 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.740
 it is probably more positive again 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.719
 there is no such thing as a 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.770
 ganondorf castle or so yes it does 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.669
 now concentrate on me 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.430
 computer opponent maybe he is 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.509
 worse than here was the crisis ever 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.830
 after how do you adjust them normally 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:52.750
 that helped a lot, thank you 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.520
 but above all, I also find something 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.620
 it stands out that the technology makes it then 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.599
 So playful now 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.129
 not so much changed the mechanics 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.659
 has actually remained exactly the same 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.490
 Everyone will become that immediately 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.400
 but they will be fine 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.110
 What's the point that has the resolution 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:17.020
 Just who wants to shoot completely 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:19.569
 many books do not care if is damned 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.529
 I am slowly standing there but helping 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.060
 be pretty strong 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.339
 The balancing is actually always quite 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.759
 well i have 143 that means he is 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:29.759
 weak good that there are some plugged 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:39.520
 that was good of me but I think so 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.370
 until then, I still spank 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.979
 I 've somehow got into it 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.560
 darth vader does not know how to handle him 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.149
 has many handle mandl was here somehow 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.520
 is then too big that I can him 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.990
 can measure on 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.659
 maybe you always work on you know 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.819
 nothing happens yet that's up to me 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:01.419
 Superior game is intelligence or is 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.430
 there is a great at collecting wants 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.639
 then you get a very big blow 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.259
 I know that now 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.300
 we can, however, the stronger 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.380
 beat out 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:17.389
 First we have to say I'm awesome 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:19.639
 no longer hate alpine space during missions 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.810
 of course we're great too 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:29.030
 then take all on 1 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:34.880
 einbrießen express.com cat and can 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:41.450
 More is already at 118 now 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.919
 Help is that you never really 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:49.370
 right in the middle of actually realized 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:52.400
 one notes second very well pacman 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.860
 applauds the building and applauded 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.470
 very good 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.270
 big big gaudi we still have 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.250
 not every beer brings but we came 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.650
 I found that super smash 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.310
 Bros real fun computer holtby first time 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.450
 In any case, super great game can 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.669
 We only recommend for all multiplayer 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.650
 fans should have the new eu on 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.550
 played every event or for people who 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.550
 clemes plays more
