 Medium to 11 Masumoto go to 2 game 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.300
 mackerel 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.590
 It is Masuda of the game land today 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.940
 October 12, 2013 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:32.200
 Pokemon xm on y will be released in the world 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:38.160
 As Bokubunno Station Shijo is released for the first time in the world at the same time 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:42.510
 Everyone in the world can enjoy Pokemon battle and inspection exchange at the same time 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.520
 We are excited from now while thinking such a figure 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.170
 masa is this stage 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.290
 In fact the Karos region 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.890
 France is a motif 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.190
 At first I thought about the theme of the game 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.900
 I decided to make it beautiful 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.490
 Where is the place that fits the theme 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.750
 I thought 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.520
 One country came to mind 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.620
 The world-kun tourists is said to often 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.950
 Phrases famous for fashion 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.050
 cuisine 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.350
 It is a wonderfully beautiful kunini served 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.409
 A country that is particular about the beauty of words 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.810
 so 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.310
 I it was France 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.980
 By the way, Karos region is classical Greek 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.250
 Named from d 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:38.420
 I went to France for the first time in 2000 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.470
 It is time for the first Pokemon movie to be released 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:48.340
 The current sentence Black Pokemon White then in 10 years 2010 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.560
 Between one month from the end of the project since the end 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.740
 I personally traveled in France 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.659
 Paris Of course things while avinion 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.310
 A certain end in one marseille 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.010
 Other than Mont Saint-Michel 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.289
 a left and right 9 n 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:11.319
 I remember that everything I saw in the Loire castle was beautiful 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:19.069
 And this time in 2011 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:23.140
 I went to France in earnest with the staff of prefecture flick 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.900
 City Miare City to become a center of Karos region 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.810
 I used Paris as a reference 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.650
 I was interviewed carefully and of course staff 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.510
 After all if you say that France is Ali 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.300
 It incorporates elements that seem to be commonplace 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.880
 But of course I used Paris for reference only 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.050
 You 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.160
 Lion 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.240
 Lance also refer to 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.569
 Please take a look at Karasyocho 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:59.569
 I think you are lined with left of many things Let's 4 like a to take a look at the person 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:04.040
 I got the idea from this Karnak ruins 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:09.640
 Information on Karnak ruins was not collected easily even if it was checked in Japan 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.940
 I asked the guide to join and carefully interviewed the site 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.290
 Enlightenment is localized in the research trip 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:22.330
 I was also accompanied by a French member 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.430
 So the problem is I did not, but the way a number of times words 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.220
 Are you a game league master? 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.200
 It is multiplied by the voice 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.280
 I think it would barre if France is a bad motif 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.280
 I remember I was excited 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:46.489
 And the Karos region makes France as a motif, but it is also included 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.870
 Because it is a motif, not in France itself but in a new world created by the game Rick 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.400
 It has become 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.160
 Karos 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.840
 Please look forward to 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:02.930
 Many new Pokemon appear in the Karos region 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:08.530
 Pokemon that have been published up to now 20 bodies 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.300
 I would like to integrally announced long-awaited Why here 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:21.370

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:25.950
 It is said that the ancient soul dwelled on the sword that people used in this Pokemon steel ghost type 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.569
 In three months a little to release the rear in the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.729
 Fun when you go in yourself when it is released in October 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:39.060
 Because I want you to discover 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:42.670
 I would like to do this so as not to lose much content in me 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.740
 Please wait longer and wait 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:54.460
 Finally, there is what you want to Shusshu do not forget Asoso 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:56.190
 It is one of the contents built in fairly well as k Ray Clay Game Riku 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.449

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.900
 Please look forward to it 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:06.259

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.650
