that<00:01:24.509> apart<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> D<00:01:25.890> chord<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that apart just like the D chord at the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.960 
that apart just like the D chord at the
beginning<00:01:26.850> two<00:01:26.970> swords

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.460 

after<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.510> is<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.960> really<00:01:36.260> cool<00:01:36.409> part

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
after that this is the really cool part

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.990 
after that this is the really cool part
I<00:01:36.680> think<00:01:37.270> after<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.300> play<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.720> last<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.640> hit

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
I think after you play that last you hit

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.649 
I think after you play that last you hit
the<00:01:41.330> second<00:01:41.780> string<00:01:42.260> from<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.590> top<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.659> then

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
the second string from the top and then

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.510 
the second string from the top and then
you<00:01:44.810> put<00:01:44.960> your<00:01:45.140> ring<00:01:45.320> finger<00:01:45.530> down<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.220> the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
you put your ring finger down on the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.719 
you put your ring finger down on the
string<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.090> hit<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.570> strum<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:51.729> so

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
string you just hit and strum so it's so

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.700 
string you just hit and strum so it's so
it<00:01:52.880> goes<00:01:53.090> d<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:55.869> minor

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710
