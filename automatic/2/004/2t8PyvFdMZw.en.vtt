 natural was applied directly with the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.610
 hands what I want is that I like a 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.360
 little skin tone without giving me 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.360
 not much coverage 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.350
 every time that the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.190
 skin and I can go back to my 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.600
 lighter bases and I'm very happy 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.750
 If using this product that I received 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.950
 of caneo and the truth is that I like 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.160
 very much has a factor 6 of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.680
 sunscreen and I apply it first with 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.650
 hands and then he blurred it with the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.590
 burlesque pro 02 brush to be already 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.480
 the skin a little hydrated with the tail 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.390
 screen 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.720
 let's say it melts super well and gives a 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.790
 very natural look 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.700
 How did the appearance of the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.550
 self-tanning 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.180
 but yes without leaving those super spots 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.400
 all right 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.530
 in the area of ​​the villages there is a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.530
 little bit on the top of the forehead 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.920
 and that area here also that's where 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.660
 it would give us the sun and I like it too 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.550
 give in this area of ​​the cheeks because 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.480
 I the truth that when I get a lot 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.450
 Sun 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.310
 all this strip of here I get 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.290
 brunette or red 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.950
 a little bit in this area I also like 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.900
 giving is very subtle then I do not know either 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.420
 no more flashy I like this 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.690
 product I'm using this concealer 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.590
 of lealcan is so cheap that they will wear 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.530
 an incredible rod 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.150
 if you still blew it with the same 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.680
 brush is a very fast makeup and 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.910
 use all the time with the same 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.360
 brush 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.620
 and it's so big that it 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.040
 spread super anger 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.739
 I'm going to nuance the face with the powders 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.060
 of the pointer 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:57.129
 universal channel on tone 25 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.049
 and he applied to this gap is 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.459
 back is that I do not have I do not have the 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.310
 number in this handle but good is a 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.239
 super large and super soft bag and for 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.030
 down orange I use the dwelling 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.110
 good is on youtube this is leander 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.370
 burlesque that I'm liking a lot 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.310
 because it is 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.250
 much harder than the internal habitable 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.109
 and we are there knowing each other and we 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.549
 we are falling quite well 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.880
 Make up the eyebrows with the pencil 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.280
 aspasia browich in the middle tone in 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.020
 prank curls the eyelashes this is also 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.360
 of burlesque the truth is that it opens 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.410
 quite and I really like to project 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.240
 the eyelash is like very comfortable lifts 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.840
 very well and if you see I think yes the 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.810
 difference from one tab to another 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.810
 uses a roller mask bnp 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.090
 and I'm going to finish saying a 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.480
 little bit of the face with the same streak of 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.570
 before and the lagoon powders of more 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.130
 I use the brush pro 04 with the brush 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.710
 pro 04 of burlesque and this blusher 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.690
 urban dj that is beautiful and it is the tone 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.660
 offset 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.130
 it's a very cold tone and for the area 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.270
 the cheeks to give that touch of health 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.270
 It's super nice 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.000
 to integrate it because you see castelo as 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.240
 only the manzanitas to integrate the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.759
 keyboard uses dallas rouge 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.709
 benefit that is a tone almost no to rum is 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.449
 much darker 

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:35.839
 and following a little bit the direction of 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.839
 cheekbone 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:42.079
 on the lips I'm going to outline a little 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.239
 with the pencil of to face and is to be 

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:48.260
 perfect I do not know if we have to put the 

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:51.880
 I really give it a little bit of shape 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.880
 and ryan a little the corners 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.200
 for the lips it was used 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:03.010
 the water comb and it is the tone 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.010
 the v 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.350
 I love it because it 's how it increases 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.350
 person 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:19.159
 and I finish with the pro 03 brush 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.159
 burlesque and the illuminator maryland ice 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.850
 I'm going to put this effect of h &amp; m I think 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.640
 super comfortable is very very fluid fabric 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.010
 it weighs nothing and it is the short shorts 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.770
 you could not see how good it was 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.830
 put in the last video blog that I went up 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.560
 and I find it super comfortable and on the feet 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.350
 I learn these to feel cats of said 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.380
 that I love are super comfortable and 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.330
 good they add a touch of color to the look 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.580
 from there last but not least 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.850
 important what to do before leaving 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.560
 through the door is with sun protection 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.120
 you are ideal and it is very good because 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.350
 besides, he does not have alcohol , which to me 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.650
 I like it a lot because sometimes I'm running 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.150
 the blade passes me super fast and then 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.390
 like burning I have a little alcohol 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.190
 is that it kills me alive and this one also does not 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.160
 It's dry and I like it a lot and 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.410
 I always look for things like that and the perfume 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.380
 I will use today is this the 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.540
 Occitan good I just say better in
