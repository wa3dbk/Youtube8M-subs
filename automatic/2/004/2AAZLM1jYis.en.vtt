John's TCR line and the state's starts

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.269 
John's TCR line and the state's starts
at<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.060> giant<00:00:18.720> composit<00:00:19.260> 3<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> goes

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
at like giant composit 3 and it goes

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.120 
at like giant composit 3 and it goes
down<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:22.080> down<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
numbers up with the with the price so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.040 
numbers up with the with the price so
this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.939> TCR<00:00:27.449> old<00:00:27.630> one

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this is TCR old one

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.099 
this is TCR old one
I<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.800> four<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.210> listed<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.510> fourteen

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
I got four it was listed for fourteen

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.340 
I got four it was listed for fourteen
hundred<00:00:31.650> plus<00:00:32.489> tax<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> spring<00:00:34.110> time

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
hundred plus tax but it's a spring time

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740 
hundred plus tax but it's a spring time
in<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.190> bike<00:00:35.460> shop<00:00:35.489> wanted<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.180> business<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
in the bike shop wanted some business so

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.639 
in the bike shop wanted some business so
they<00:00:36.960> gave<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.380> me<00:00:37.410> 1,400<00:00:38.129> Texan<00:00:39.500> which<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
they gave to me 1,400 Texan which is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.270 
they gave to me 1,400 Texan which is
more<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.890> less<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> same<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.309> US<00:00:41.700> dollars<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
more or less the same in US dollars so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.000 
more or less the same in US dollars so
this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.980> aluminum<00:00:47.489> body

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 

I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> seats<00:00:51.480> days<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:52.020> aluminum<00:00:52.469> too

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I think the seats days are aluminum too

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.260 
I think the seats days are aluminum too
but<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.699> seat<00:00:54.420> post<00:00:54.800> that's<00:00:55.800> carbon<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
but the seat post that's carbon and the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.759 
but the seat post that's carbon and the
fork<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.960> curved<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:59.730> has<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:01.070> 105<00:01:02.070> drive<00:01:02.489> chain

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
fork is curved it has a 105 drive chain

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.820 
fork is curved it has a 105 drive chain
so<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> pipe<00:01:05.729> shifted<00:01:06.830> 105

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so we have when the pipe shifted 105

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.450 
so we have when the pipe shifted 105
front<00:01:08.220> derailleur<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.170> 105<00:01:10.170> rear<00:01:11.010> derailleur

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
front derailleur and 105 rear derailleur

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
front derailleur and 105 rear derailleur
I<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.479> changed<00:01:12.930> t<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:13.350> 2<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:13.799> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
I think they changed t over 2 which is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.570 
I think they changed t over 2 which is
kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> cool

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.539 

crank<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.530> double<00:01:19.890> compact<00:01:20.369> I'm

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
crank it's a it's a double compact I'm

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.100 
crank it's a it's a double compact I'm
not<00:01:20.700> sure<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.689> teeth<00:01:21.900> number<00:01:23.960> mine's<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
not sure about the teeth number mine's a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.450 
not sure about the teeth number mine's a

oh the brakes the brake levers are in

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
oh the brakes the brake levers are in
the<00:01:49.710> grid<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.280> 105<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> actual

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the grid so that's 105 but the actual

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.840 
the grid so that's 105 but the actual
brakes<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.380> tapped<00:01:53.070> rows<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.610> known

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
no no 723 wheels this this bike has a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.400 
no no 723 wheels this this bike has a
racing<00:02:14.910> geometry<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.989> has<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> same

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
racing geometry so it has the same

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.870 
racing geometry so it has the same
geometry<00:02:16.769> as<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.940> teeth<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.840> TCR<00:02:19.880> series

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
geometry as the teeth as a TCR series

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.729 
geometry as the teeth as a TCR series
like<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> composit<00:02:21.540> series<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.440> ones<00:02:22.620> with

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
like the composit series the ones with

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.640 
like the composit series the ones with
the<00:02:22.829> carbon<00:02:23.160> frames<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:25.049> like<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.530> if

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the carbon frames it's not like that if

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.710 
the carbon frames it's not like that if
I<00:02:25.860> were<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:30.329> this<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.569> called

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
I were the the I think this is called

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.050 
I were the the I think this is called
top<00:02:30.989> tubas<00:02:31.380> slopes<00:02:31.650> down<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:32.790> their

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
top tubas slopes down and that's their

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.050 
top tubas slopes down and that's their
endurance<00:02:33.930> line<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.910> like<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
endurance line like the like the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.559 
endurance line like the like the
specialized<00:02:36.540> sector<00:02:37.160> Roubaix<00:02:38.160> etc<00:02:41.299> shop<00:02:42.299> put

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
specialized sector Roubaix etc shop put

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.289

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
on these metal bottle cages which I
