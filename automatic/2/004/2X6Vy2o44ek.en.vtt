 several dogs and birds also feel 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 increasingly common that we listen to 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.820
 talk about the so-called psychologists of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.650
 dogs although it sounds strange today light 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 elena bouquet met those who are

 this is urban 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:35.190
 at first glance he looked like a stroller 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 dogs I think it's part of the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.500
 mentality but I do not dedicate myself to that but 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.090
 then what is your work 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.370
 locate according to problem the dogs 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.080
 becoming a problem for my life if 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 I eat aggressive shoes with others 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.920
 dogs with people and I go to your 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.720
 house evaluated the case we look at how 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.350
 we will solve seated and at once 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.210
 I'm giving the first very short no 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.769
 give him a speech because if you tell him 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 that the little words of everything that everything 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.390
 quiet you lost it is not saying 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.310
 Go ahead, it's worth something to go 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 forward I will be exact increases your 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.360
 rhythm level until when 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.360
 advancing delays with your hands 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 because the dehesas and what we are is 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.909
 better marking loyal that you have more 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.289
 force that he is an illusion for the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.539
 dog he is stronger four times than 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:29.369
 you but the most powerful according to christian 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.719
 the most serious that people commit 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.880
 with their pets is to humanize them I have 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.200
 cute I come for something beautiful 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.149
 that's talking to the dog as if it were 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 a child that does that but without 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.619
 anxious vulnerable are not children are 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.659
 dogs we always have to see that they are 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.459
 animals what has been like the most 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.000

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.489
 We are both because it got tense 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.769
 preventively the cue 6 -five 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.720
 initial- moment a call interrupts 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.079
 our conversation we do have and is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.079
