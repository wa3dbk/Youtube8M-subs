00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.680
 gb currently has about 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.070
 How many models of game motherboards are 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.990
 called g1 killer 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.510
 in today's video we will talk and we 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.520
 we will focus on the audio part since 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.010
 said plates offer a very pack 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.840
 full 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.540
 to get the most out of it 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.210
 of our music and our games 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.100
 to better understand this topic and take the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 maximum benefit I will talk to you 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.130
 continuation of a series of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.090
 features that are not offered 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 said base plates 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 gb and the motherboard of the series g a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 rent are the first in the world in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 offer an integrated socket to be able to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 interchange the amplifiers 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 operational open to mp in this way the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.480
 user can enjoy their 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.280
 European audio preferences mp is 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.079
 mounted on a socket that allows the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.809
 users can replace easy and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.519
 there are several models of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
 I oppÃ© mp each of them after 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.809
 has a series of properties for 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.809
 get a specific type of audio 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.780
 some models of the series that a 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.450
 gigabyte rentals incorporate a 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.280
 USB 2.0 port bathed in gold that 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.680
 provides a clean and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.420
 noise free the two traditional 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.890
 can become sensitive to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.560
 fluctuations in the power supply 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 other usb ports for it gb it 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.460
 benefits from an exclusive diet 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.110
 and there is clear that minimizes said 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.950
 fluctuations to get the most 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 performance 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.890
 basically it's a sound processor 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.869
 multi-colored dedicated high 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 performance that processes the audio by 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.450
 hardware benefiting from a suite of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.450
 software sound blaster 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.640
 to get even more out of it 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.900
 we have a switch switch where 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 we can choose the modes of 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.060
 amplification being 2 5 and 6 x 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.990
 depending on the output device and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 its roaming 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.530
 additionally have a 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.170
 Audio amplifier with an impedance 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.600
 of 600 ohms for the front of a 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.200
 Exclusive pc box only for 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.610
 headphones 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.610
 in this way it improves the dynamic range 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.130
 it allows us to protect and isolate noise 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.069
 of electromagnetic interference 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.590
 other components of the motherboard 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.629
 for this the whole audio set is 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.159
 located in an area of pcb and separated 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.159
 for a band with a lighting 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.260
 capacitor is very chic on offer for 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.660
 each audio channel a few capacitors 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.370
 polarized nici with high-end 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.620
 the series of mousse the tonality 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.330
 main is to offer a better breadth 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.330
 realism and richness in the audio 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.170
 currently in the market there are several 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.350
 models of the series of a rent both 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.600
 for inter as md offering models 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.080
 adapted to all types of budget the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.080
 you can see below
