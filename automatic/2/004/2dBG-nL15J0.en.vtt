00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.430 
since I have a quest that's located in
this<00:02:29.160> area<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.750> dot<00:02:30.990> dots

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this area you can see that the dot dots

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
this area you can see that the dot dots
there<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.790> could<00:02:33.360> simply<00:02:33.810> go<00:02:34.670> outside<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
there I could simply go outside to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.100 
there I could simply go outside to
another<00:02:36.330> location<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.640> another<00:02:39.330> quest<00:02:39.750> we'll

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
another location to another quest we'll

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.060 
another location to another quest we'll
just<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.500> say<00:02:40.770> how<00:02:41.130> about<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.430> cold<00:02:41.730> blood<00:02:41.940> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
then load to their last checkpoint if we

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790 
then load to their last checkpoint if we
have<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> quest<00:02:47.490> highlighted<00:02:48.500> such<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.650> this

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
and then we load the last checkpoint it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.770 
and then we load the last checkpoint it
will<00:02:52.470> load<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.070> checkpoint<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.940> quest

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
obviously you probably wouldn't do this

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.090 
obviously you probably wouldn't do this
for<00:03:18.540> walkers<00:03:18.959> but<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.350> there's<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.590> location

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
for walkers but if there's a location

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.979 
for walkers but if there's a location
with<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> thug<00:03:20.670> or<00:03:21.030> something<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.810> want

with a thug or something that you want
to<00:03:22.050> fight<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.550> could<00:03:23.700> do<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
to fight then you could do that in the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.000 
to fight then you could do that in the
same<00:03:25.290> situation<00:03:25.950> now<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.440> next<00:03:28.770> thing<00:03:28.950> that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
same situation now the next thing that
