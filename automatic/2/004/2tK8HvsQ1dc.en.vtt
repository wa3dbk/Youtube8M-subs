00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.080
 talk to me, everybody 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.269
 today we will continue there with the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.550
 character creation and picking up the theme 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.139
 of women is thank you for the 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.359
 drawings that you sent there for us 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.099
 have to respond to everyone and continue 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.099
 Sending let's start 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.240
 geometric shapes to create a 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.370
 woman is summed up in triangle and heart 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.860
 following this basis as the man who 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.310
 we used a box that looked like 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.890
 with the disposable cup and rectangles and 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.960
 the circle to draw the woman 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.210
 we will do with the two triangles 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.640
 It's a heart teacher, but we like people. 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.280
 makes a woman with this very simple 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 You can already notice first that I 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.570
 Trust I put two heads one of each 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.120
 side to calculate the shoulder 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.130
 but what happens to the woman's shoulder is 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 a little lower than that of the man himself 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.750
 she having eight heads 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.240
 so look, I just figured out a 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.900
 head but using a little less than 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.060
 a head to create the shoulder she created 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.460
 a little smaller than the man's 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.570
 after that I'll go to the end of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.310
 head number 4 and create a triangle 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.860
 this triangle he has to turn from 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:33.759
 head here until the end of the head 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:33.759
 number 4 filming the triangle hakim 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.100
 the triangle is ready then this 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.909
 triangle is the first part of the body of the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.799
 woman 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.390
 after that we 'll take a risk 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.590
 down here is going to be the risk of 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.479
 her hips 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.430
 so we're going to do the same risk here 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.509
 below the same size as that risk 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.240
 here from the shoulder 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.060
 so let's add a risk here 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.909
 with this now we will pull a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.700
 triangle up against the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.700
 tip of gold here with man line 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.819
 there as the body stayed from here only 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.590
 the heart is now missing for us 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.750
 have closed all over the top of the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.470
 woman's body at heart it will come 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.720
 on here 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.970
 also at the point where the top triangle 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.130
 It's pointing out that we're going to make knots. 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.040
 Let's get from here to the end in the head. 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.430
 number 2 and let's make a heart here 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:40.100
 invested or payable from here to stay 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:43.070
 easier for you to view the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.530
 heart and it will be the woman's breasts 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.690
 from here all that we go 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.150
 to do is like the man after 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.670
 that we've closed that part here for 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.880
 to do the legs is the same as the man 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.769
 we got here and we make a line 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.769
 until the end of head number 8 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.220
 we found the lines of the legs 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.780
 the same calculation of the man 's knee is 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:19.010
 added to that of women is the same as 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:24.079
 Man's ankle is the same the morning 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.120
 creating panic for the feet and the same 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.730
 thing happens with the arm let's do 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.440
 a half circle of the shoulder behind the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:37.150
 breasts to pull the arm that goes there 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.150
 be a little thinner than the man's 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.410
 at the height of the woman's navel 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.410
 the first dollar and at the groin height 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.610
 or at the end of the head number 4 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:03.810
 pulse and then the hand the same thing as the other 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:13.020
 side the stroke at the height of the seat 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:15.920
 hip and hands neck and there is the 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.920
 woman's creation 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.900
 the variation of bodies it is of sum 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.730
 the importance of creating a 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.889
 character whenever you are 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.400
 creating your character 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.470
 remember that the ratio and size 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.440
 of the characters have to be different 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.270
 and not create the same character several 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.330
 characters of the same size 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.360
 look only when you're drawing 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.440
 a character remember the chubby 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.450
 of normal 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.060
 remember sepsis as well as 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.550
 lean and short when 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.340
 you create characters of sizes 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.590
 and characters and ponds and 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.540
 proportions of different bodies 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.430
 the tires are characters will get rich 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.200
 and natural as if you were seeing 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.350
 people on the street as there are people 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.600
 slim tall chicks and that's what you 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.190
 You should know and are thinking at the time of 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.010
 create your characters 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.130
 thinking about body variations is this 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.130
 there 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.389
 beauty charm has everything to do with 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.879
 movement the woman's movement has to 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.949
 be gentle and gentle when we create 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.620
 here the skeleton to draw a 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.479
 woman is one thing because because she 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.550
 is totally straight that only for 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.620
 we understand the proportion 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.870
 after that for since when do we go 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.819
 to create a character to be worth a fan either 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.039
 make a sensual woman 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.770
 we will use the same movement of 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.740
 front only with a higher position 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.120
 sensual woman gives charm and beauty 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.729
 that she has 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.800
 doing what we go what we 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.080
 Let's create let's change these two 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.550
 triangles here to make an hourglass 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.240
 how we're going to make the body of the 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.550
 woman 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.229
 we will do the straight line of the shoulder and 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.219
 let's use instead of using the lines 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:16.590
 straight from the triangle we're going to use 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:21.779
 small curves to make the part of the 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:26.000
 chest and abdomen deal beginning and 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:29.699
 hip as if it were an hourglass 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.879
 so with this format here we go 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:36.180
 create a simplified way of doing the 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.969
 movement here the body of the woman looking 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.159
 in this example here what I did I did 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:44.879
 as if it were a flag a piece of 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:48.900
 bacon I picked this one It's so beautiful and I 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:54.060
 I imported a little to do this 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.250
 move here the hip can see that 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.229
 shoulder it slightly upwards because 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.169
 she is and no one will arm until 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:03.509
 and this part is tilted because 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:04.110
 one of her legs is thrown to the 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.270
 side 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.000
 so it happened that she stays in a 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.919
 comfortable position and sex 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.860
 so always remember when you 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:16.379
 to create your characters already think 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.509
 What is she thinking about as she is? 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:20.520
 What is facial expression and what does it look like? 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:22.379
 is trying to prove mine is 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.339
 wanting to show that she has charm 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:28.770
 beauty, well, that's what I trained 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:30.620
 pretty and drawings your women 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.199
 Send to me to see 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.479
 use and write for you and we'll find 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.490
 perfection in the drawing also does not 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:40.130
 forget to share with the guys there 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.710
 for everyone to learn how to draw their 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.760
 friends who like to draw 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.460
 share a video let's draw 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.919
 together and for those who asked 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.300
 teacher but we are learning to 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:51.740
 make characters 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.990
 we are learning to do the 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.300
 cool characters and where's the face in 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.360
 all courses we learn to do 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.190
 face first then do not lose the 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.250
 next class the next class we will go 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:07.370
 learn how to make faces and indy before 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:11.090
 social pressures and create the 

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:14.110
 a single living shape so heads will not 

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.110
 miss the next class
