00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
is a Defra approved which means we can

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.780 
is a Defra approved which means we can
burn<00:00:24.340> wood<00:00:24.580> in<00:00:24.760> a<00:00:24.850> smoke<00:00:25.090> control<00:00:25.390> area<00:00:26.790> the

sd2<00:00:28.420> has<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.860> large<00:00:29.860> glass<00:00:31.200> which<00:00:32.200> we<00:00:32.379> like<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
sd2 has a large glass which we like the

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.029 
sd2 has a large glass which we like the
st2<00:00:36.399> can<00:00:36.730> be<00:00:36.850> fitted<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.780> 5<00:00:38.440> inch<00:00:38.739> chimney

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
st2 can be fitted to a 5 inch chimney

liner<00:00:39.400> which<00:00:40.390> we<00:00:40.570> like<00:00:42.630> let's<00:00:43.630> look<00:00:43.780> at<00:00:43.930> the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
liner which we like let's look at the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.960 
liner which we like let's look at the
controls<00:00:45.660> down<00:00:46.660> here<00:00:46.720> we<00:00:47.500> have<00:00:47.770> our<00:00:48.010> primary

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
controls down here we have our primary

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.260 
controls down here we have our primary
air<00:00:49.180> controls<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.860> allows<00:00:51.310> air<00:00:51.790> into

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
air controls and this allows air into

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.840 
air controls and this allows air into
the<00:00:52.360> stove<00:00:52.660> through<00:00:53.500> a<00:00:53.530> series<00:00:54.040> of<00:00:54.100> holes<00:00:54.520> at

let's<00:01:21.940> take<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.450> look<00:01:22.690> inside

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.090 

we<00:01:33.220> have<00:01:33.400> plenty<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.880> room<00:01:34.479> inside<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.200> SD<00:01:35.860> -

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
we have plenty of room inside the SD -

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.399 
we have plenty of room inside the SD -
in<00:01:37.030> fact<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.479> decent<00:01:38.080> sized<00:01:38.320> firebox<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.369> here

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
in fact a decent sized firebox in here

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.590 
in fact a decent sized firebox in here
plenty<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.590> logs<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.880> fact<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.180> think<00:01:43.360> we<00:01:43.450> could

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
plenty of logs in fact I think we could

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.590 
plenty of logs in fact I think we could
probably<00:01:43.750> get<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.260> few<00:01:44.440> logs<00:01:44.920> out<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.600> this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
probably get a few logs out of this this

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.840 
probably get a few logs out of this this
stove<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.640> baffle<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.690> SD<00:01:49.990> -<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.440> now

stove the baffle on the SD - is now
removable<00:01:52.080> which<00:01:53.080> means<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.500> we<00:01:53.619> can<00:01:53.800> sweep

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159

mentioned<00:02:06.250> earlier<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:07.090> have<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.360> griddle

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
mentioned earlier we have a griddle

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.350 
mentioned earlier we have a griddle
plate<00:02:08.470> at<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> base<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.580> stove<00:02:09.820> here<00:02:10.179> and

plate at the base of the stove here and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.160 
plate at the base of the stove here and
ash<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.680> fall<00:02:11.980> through<00:02:12.430> these<00:02:13.420> holes<00:02:13.780> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
ash will fall through these holes and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.930 
ash will fall through these holes and
into<00:02:17.170> our<00:02:18.330> plate<00:02:19.330> our<00:02:19.989> tray<00:02:20.320> at<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.560> bottom

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
into our plate our tray at the bottom

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.150 
into our plate our tray at the bottom
this<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.000> rather<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.959> small<00:02:23.380> ash<00:02:24.390> tray<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.980> does

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
this is rather a small ash tray it does

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.960 
this is rather a small ash tray it does
the<00:02:27.280> job<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.330> little<00:02:28.720> bit<00:02:28.870> small<00:02:29.970> but

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the job but it is a little bit small but

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.150 
the job but it is a little bit small but
we've<00:02:31.180> got<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> big<00:02:31.720> firebox<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.739> that's<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
we've got a big firebox and that's the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.330 
we've got a big firebox and that's the
main<00:02:33.340> thing

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
main thing

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.090 
main thing
the<00:02:36.340> st2<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.180> convict<00:02:37.660> -<00:02:37.870> stove<00:02:38.140> which

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
the st2 is a convict - stove which

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.979 
the st2 is a convict - stove which
essentially<00:02:39.790> means<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.480> made<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.959> two

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
essentially means it is made of two

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.100 
essentially means it is made of two
separate<00:02:41.980> layers<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.209> we<00:02:43.329> have<00:02:43.480> an<00:02:43.630> inner

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
separate layers so we have an inner

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.710 
separate layers so we have an inner
layer<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.799> steel<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.370> an<00:02:45.970> outer<00:02:46.269> layer<00:02:46.660> of

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
layer of steel and an outer layer of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.750 
layer of steel and an outer layer of
steel<00:02:48.060> air<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.769> heated<00:02:50.769> in<00:02:51.040> between<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.610> two

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
steel air is heated in between the two

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.410 
steel air is heated in between the two
layers<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.360> rises<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.260> out<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.010> vents

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
layers and rises up and out of the vents

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.530 
layers and rises up and out of the vents
these<00:02:55.420> vents<00:02:55.780> here<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.290> into<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.799> room<00:02:57.010> I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
mentioned earlier these holes that run

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.330 
mentioned earlier these holes that run

comes<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.570> through<00:03:08.019> these<00:03:08.290> holes<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.150> into

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
comes in through these holes and into

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.650 
comes in through these holes and into
the<00:03:10.239> stove<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.190> fire<00:03:12.549> rope<00:03:12.820> all<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.239> way

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
the stove we have fire rope all the way

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.759 
the stove we have fire rope all the way
around<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.170> inside<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:16.570> door<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.500> this

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
around the inside of the door and this

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.000 
around the inside of the door and this
is<00:03:17.950> replaceable<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.390> glass<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:20.110> also

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
is replaceable and the glass is also

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.339 
is replaceable and the glass is also
easily<00:03:21.730> replaceable

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349
