00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello very well and today I bring you a review 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.700
 in a way that is very very prolific 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.700
 as a duty time time to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.839
 it's really cool 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.789
 father is very much for all 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.849
 prisoners for all the people who like 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.410
 the rule your boxes will not have a 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.359
 garden is also the truth if you look at the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.149
 attention of this put in gardens all 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.280
 that's how it is in the house and it's very, very 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.739
 Pro because it will give more such 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.050
 bamboo where it is growing and what 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.329
 I just put it five minutes ago 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.550
 I think and it 's a lot because we have all kinds 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.649
 of tall plants and then show little to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.329
 little but they are more than 400 types of 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.220
 plants that we will find in 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.739
 different biomes clear that is I do not know 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.439
 who is regulated but in different and 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.000
 let's find different types of 

00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:00.040
 bercy that of fruit plants as it is 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.379
 the bamboo like these also that already 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.560
 had started to develop this 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.600
 type of cactus or nopales strive 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.790
 nopales here where the frivolous one is 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.770
 mexico 6 and we're worth these but you can not see 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.740
 very well the texture of this one also 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.600
 let's find trees like that they knew 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.299
 before the trunk were trees this type 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.520
 of tools that come out and we have to 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.710
 be able to make hanging pots also from 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.290
 pots that are pretty 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.840
 enough for other crimes what they were going to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.220
 say and what else has this engine that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.420
 let's see it from here from your 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.180
 pages see just be here are a 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.610
 jet if in these amounts of seedlings 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.909
 what we can see and the truth from 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.670
 what 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.670
 we have to choose the pro 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.649
 that are pretty 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.360
 with what has not been acted like 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.770
 any creeper so then with 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.350
 that's going to have a lot of fun for people who 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.450
 he likes they are decorating because in 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.119
 truth add too too add 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.060
 the flowers see the flowers but it's not what 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.350
 I put a few but add 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 exaggeratedly venous 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.270
 where the blocks where I like 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.410
 much also the type of flower you see 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.650
 just as many flowers and 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:34.790
 exposes that adds all 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.409
 nadal is natalia a lattice of flowers 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.970
 I do not know but I think that people 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:48.409
 he likes this so it's a flower shop 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.840
 is quite father is exaggerated 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.569
 in truth it is how many plants to add if 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.400
 is what makes it ethical because the image 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.739
 be a garden with many templates 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.409
 from different you see the truth quite 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.349
 father outline houses and very father a house 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.799
 in the jungle with pots and that of the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.690
 store is here and they are very parents 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.019
 just imagine science and nothing else 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.260
 it is a bowl a little plant of these and 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.480
 iron island pot applied were seems 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.930
 for the bamboo is never cutting of these 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.250
 and this happens and this is what the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.660
 team work 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.740
 invac will be as it is 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.850
 as dry but I like it more 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.130
 because I think it's the limit of 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.810
 growth and I would like more of 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.550
 this does not also add this kind of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.230
 little leaves as you can see the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.570
 Actions 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.810
 they are quite parents and good they appear 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.810
 different as a principle also 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.060
 well let's see how to do see which one 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.670
 be different things that is here for 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.360
 decoration we have to provide it its 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.110
 hangers also make it a being 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.120
 subtropical 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.880
 tepic the verbum two chopsticks and on the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.380
 issues is cutting in the same way that 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.450
 they are going to give him remains and doing is what 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.920
 not exactly as it is going 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.390
 and then we can articulate our more 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.660
 exquisite that is the parents 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:23.540
 also what we have are the little trees 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.710
 that I have them here exactly 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.580
 we go color that I have of oranges but 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.879
 They look alike do not know why 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.879
 and the truth is that we are going to see 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.099
 you 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.740
 It's fine I have it Spanish 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.740
 forget 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.860
 web let's see 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:58.009
 the best greens came out that also 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.439
 can be planted 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.599
 well to give us another another nice 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.909
 of this is not live anymore they do not grow but 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.990
 they give us fruits so that's also 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.990
 pretty father 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:15.789
 It also depends what type of tree that 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.789
 be cellular 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.780
 good cell phones we also have this 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.000
 mind very father of aquatic plants me 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.599
 here could ponds as mini mini 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.330
 good is not for everyone but 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:33.039
 really in those templates and it looks very 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.740
 father the truth is a permanent one 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.219
 fish tank here with glass and had its 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.050
 aquatic plants species sites that 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.060
 they install another engine where they can see the 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.129
 goal mods we made the fish would be 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.620
 quite father the truth is that it would be 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.690
 very very epic and ximo or on a motorcycle like these 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.830
 and more because they see the bamboo really 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.169
 I have wow that has me and 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.849
 Well, I really do not have anything to say 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.800
 It's a resounding 8 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.520
 the cacos are the ones that I like the 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.590
 bamboo and pots and is the block with 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.110
 overtones and zombies or what is it that most 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.340
 like I can not tell you not to see 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.340
 where he grew up we go to the stand that 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.150
 leave this one could not put more this already 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.150
 it grew this either 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:29.220
 very good for what is good 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:33.480
 we know that it is quite low 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.220
 and everything was better definitive or is it 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.080
 something that is very exaggerated very 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.850
 exaggerated but very good the truth is 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.110
 I liked and I hope you will 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.020
 I liked it just like me because 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.320
 it's really worth it to decorate the 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.940
 house also as a source of food 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.940
 for all vegetarians 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.710
 so without giving more in the long run by me 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.710
 part 

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:07.810
 the link is going to leave a description 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.050
 and well there you will tell me I am lx and 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.050
 bye
