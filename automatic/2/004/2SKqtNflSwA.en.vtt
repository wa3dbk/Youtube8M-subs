00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.490 
doesn't think so
I<00:03:33.620> can't<00:03:34.190> believe<00:03:34.490> that<00:03:34.790> came<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:36.380> know

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
I can't believe that came in you know

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.100 
I can't believe that came in you know
also<00:03:36.710> from<00:03:36.940> Sophie's<00:03:37.940> point<00:03:38.270> of<00:03:38.450> view<00:03:38.690> if<00:03:38.900> she

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
also from Sophie's point of view if she

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.630 
also from Sophie's point of view if she
knows<00:03:39.350> she's<00:03:39.590> playing<00:03:39.890> Jana<00:03:40.100> who's<00:03:40.340> going<00:03:40.550> to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
knows she's playing Jana who's going to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.060 
knows she's playing Jana who's going to
come<00:03:40.850> in<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.090> whole<00:03:41.270> time<00:03:41.570> she's<00:03:42.140> objective

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
come in the whole time she's objective

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.500 
come in the whole time she's objective
is<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.220> keep<00:03:43.460> you<00:03:43.580> out<00:03:43.610> are<00:03:43.820> away<00:03:43.970> from<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.330> ned

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
is to keep you out are away from the ned

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.790 
is to keep you out are away from the ned
and<00:03:44.540> therefore<00:03:45.140> one<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.470> things<00:03:45.680> she's

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
and therefore one of the things she's

00:03:45.800 --> 00:04:04.680 
and therefore one of the things she's
got<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.070> do<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.310> lop<00:03:46.550> early<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.330> match<00:04:03.459> a

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
got to do is lop early in the match a

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.730 
got to do is lop early in the match a
breakpoint<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:06.410> she<00:04:06.650> wins<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.070> opening<00:04:07.220> game
