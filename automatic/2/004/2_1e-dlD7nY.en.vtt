00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
features of Windows 2000 okay so when

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
features of Windows 2000 okay so when
Windows<00:01:11.369> 2000<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.119> had<00:01:12.270> DVD<00:01:12.810> support<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.920> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
Windows 2000 you had DVD support so that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
Windows 2000 you had DVD support so that
meant<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> could<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.909> literally

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
meant that you could just literally

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.639 
meant that you could just literally
sling<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> disc<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.490> could<00:01:17.610> play<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.940> so

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
sling a disc in and you could play it so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.749 
sling a disc in and you could play it so
I've<00:01:19.649> said<00:01:19.830> I've<00:01:19.979> disc<00:01:20.190> in<00:01:20.369> blood

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I've said I've disc in blood

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.469 
I've said I've disc in blood
you<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.450> play<00:01:21.600> movies<00:01:22.159> audio<00:01:23.450> which<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
you could play movies audio which is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.620 
you could play movies audio which is
especially<00:01:25.229> good<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.530> laptops<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.190> time

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
especially good for laptops at the time

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
especially good for laptops at the time
obviously<00:01:27.630> there's<00:01:28.110> no<00:01:28.289> 1080p<00:01:29.250> videos<00:01:29.580> at

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
obviously there's no 1080p videos at

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
obviously there's no 1080p videos at
that<00:01:29.909> time<00:01:30.149> will<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.509> Reagan<00:01:30.800> didn't<00:01:31.800> exist

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that time will you Reagan didn't exist

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910 
that time will you Reagan didn't exist
so<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> only<00:01:33.840> sort<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> low<00:01:34.319> quality<00:01:34.560> type

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so it was only sort of low quality type

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.600 
so it was only sort of low quality type
videos<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:36.770> not<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> suited<00:01:38.250> people<00:01:38.490> for

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
videos but not that suited people for

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.930 
videos but not that suited people for
the<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:39.319> it's<00:01:40.319> also<00:01:40.670> supported<00:01:41.670> multi

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
the time it's also supported multi

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.270 
the time it's also supported multi
monitors<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.539> you<00:01:42.600> could<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.929> of<00:01:43.259> debt<00:01:43.920> 10

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
monitors so you could have of debt 10

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.960 
monitors so you could have of debt 10
video<00:01:44.580> cards<00:01:45.000> um<00:01:47.149> 10<00:01:48.149> monitors<00:01:49.640> I've<00:01:50.640> gone<00:01:50.789> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
video cards um 10 monitors I've gone to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.430 
video cards um 10 monitors I've gone to

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
resolutions and Chordettes if desired

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.270 
resolutions and Chordettes if desired
so<00:01:57.479> viously<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:58.500> machine<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:58.890> running<00:01:59.130> out

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so viously this machine I'm running out

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.810 
so viously this machine I'm running out
it's<00:02:00.000> such<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> true<00:02:00.569> classic<00:02:00.990> two-bit<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.820> not

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
it's such a true classic two-bit and not

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.279 
it's such a true classic two-bit and not
to<00:02:02.909> turn<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.270> change<00:02:03.509> pixels<00:02:04.049> but

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
to turn about change pixels but

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.139 
to turn about change pixels but
obviously<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.280> time<00:02:05.490> people<00:02:05.820> were<00:02:05.939> still

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
obviously at the time people were still

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.410 
obviously at the time people were still
running

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
running

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.350 
running
CRTs<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.530> you'd<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.190> 1024<00:02:08.880> by<00:02:09.030> 768

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
CRTs so you'd have 1024 by 768

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.069 
CRTs so you'd have 1024 by 768
resolution<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.180> accessibility<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.930> much

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
resolution so the accessibility was much

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.470 
resolution so the accessibility was much
better<00:02:13.350> as<00:02:13.530> well<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.670> accessibility

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
better as well so the accessibility

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.520 
better as well so the accessibility

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
suing myself so new to me as well and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.650 
suing myself so new to me as well and
smallest<00:02:44.280> text<00:02:44.730> hmm<00:02:45.630> must<00:02:45.989> have<00:02:46.049> thought<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
smallest text hmm must have thought I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.970 
smallest text hmm must have thought I
was<00:02:48.660> Miss<00:02:48.810> everything<00:02:49.290> bigger<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.829> getting

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
was Miss everything bigger and getting

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.060 
was Miss everything bigger and getting
magnify<00:02:50.489> up<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.750> piss<00:02:51.870> off<00:02:52.019> now

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.990 

we'll<00:02:55.070> just<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:56.090> back<00:02:56.300> height<00:02:56.540> was<00:02:57.940> okay<00:02:58.940> so

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
we'll just that back height was okay so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.550 
we'll just that back height was okay so
that<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.960> default<00:03:00.320> now<00:03:01.250> for<00:03:01.460> Windows<00:03:01.670> 2000

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that is the default now for Windows 2000

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.370 
that is the default now for Windows 2000
so<00:03:04.150> also<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.210> could<00:03:05.420> move<00:03:05.810> files<00:03:06.170> without

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
so also you could move files without

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.280 
so also you could move files without
wires<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.880> infrared<00:03:08.150> mind<00:03:08.450> -<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.690> supports

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
wires so the infrared mind - it supports

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.250 
wires so the infrared mind - it supports
irda<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:11.540> file<00:03:11.720> transfer<00:03:11.870> between

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
irda and the file transfer between

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.050 
irda and the file transfer between
Windows<00:03:12.650> 2000<00:03:13.070> machines<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.610> digital

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
Windows 2000 machines and digital

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.080 
Windows 2000 machines and digital
cameras<00:03:14.390> digital<00:03:14.600> video<00:03:15.410> cameras<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.130> all

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
cameras digital video cameras and all

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.300 
cameras digital video cameras and all
the<00:03:17.330> devices<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:19.600> yeah<00:03:20.630> infrared<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:22.190> up

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
the devices so yeah infrared that's up

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.660 
the devices so yeah infrared that's up
um<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.900> did<00:03:24.140> support<00:03:24.530> wireless<00:03:24.890> although<00:03:25.550> it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
um it did support wireless although it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.890 
um it did support wireless although it
was<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.880> little<00:03:25.940> bit<00:03:26.180> finicky<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.570> get<00:03:26.810> it

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
was a little bit finicky to get it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.990 
was a little bit finicky to get it
working<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:27.350> well<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.340> have<00:03:28.370> tried<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.850> once

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
working as well and I have tried it once

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.980 
working as well and I have tried it once
before<00:03:29.150> but<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:30.200> was<00:03:30.290> never<00:03:30.500> any<00:03:30.680> good<00:03:30.770> so<00:03:31.160> so

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
before but it was never any good so so

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.160 
before but it was never any good so so
yeah<00:03:32.990> I<00:03:33.940> thought<00:03:34.940> less<00:03:35.150> device<00:03:35.600> installation

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
yeah I thought less device installation

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.160 
yeah I thought less device installation
which<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:37.400> have<00:03:37.580> new<00:03:37.760> technology<00:03:38.300> such<00:03:38.480> as<00:03:38.510> USB

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
which is have new technology such as USB

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.270 
which is have new technology such as USB
and<00:03:39.470> firewire<00:03:40.960> making<00:03:41.960> Windows<00:03:42.560> 2000<00:03:43.190> more

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
and firewire making Windows 2000 more

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.160 
and firewire making Windows 2000 more
expandable<00:03:43.880> with<00:03:44.060> fewer<00:03:44.540> problems<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:44.990> as<00:03:45.080> you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
expandable with fewer problems so as you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.800 
expandable with fewer problems so as you
can<00:03:45.290> see<00:03:45.470> I've<00:03:46.040> got<00:03:46.400> my<00:03:46.700> pen<00:03:47.390> drive<00:03:47.510> plugged

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
can see I've got my pen drive plugged

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.210 
can see I've got my pen drive plugged
into<00:03:47.960> here<00:03:48.140> obviously<00:03:49.660> that's<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:51.220> straight

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
into here obviously that's it straight

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.460 
into here obviously that's it straight
working<00:03:52.820> okay<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:53.720> it's<00:03:53.990> also<00:03:54.110> supported

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
working okay so it's also supported

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.180 
working okay so it's also supported
plug-and-play

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190
