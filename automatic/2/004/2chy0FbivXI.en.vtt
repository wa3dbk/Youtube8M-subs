 hello to you all on the channel visiting 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.500
 Slavik and today I want to tell you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.009
 how can you do it yourself 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.830
 smokehouse for fish for that to me 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.020
 it took two pitivi black pans 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.340
 here they are they you see in 1 pan and from 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.760
 gave birth to a hole 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.970
 cut the thread and screw the bolts in there 4 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.820
 bolts such twisted here they are from the inside 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:43.739
 you can see here they are 4 bolts here 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:48.260
 they are in 2 pans as you see i 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.780
 I cut the bottom here with a grinder cut the bottom and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:58.079
 under drilling holes planted it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 case on the rivets here they are not rivets 6 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.070
 no rivets needed for that here 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.070
 they are outside you can see rivets 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 here 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.080
 next I drilled a hole in the pan 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.240
 in order to be able to wear these 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.830
 here is a skewer 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.790
 skewers and I needed you in order 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.580
 so here on such hooks here on such 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.320
 hooks hanging fish here it is 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.030
 dresses calmly and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.780
 you can hang a fish well fish here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.900
 it is desirable to hang on such handles 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.510
 little 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.530
 such fish as herring has not gone for 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.450
 This she began to fall there but this about 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.060

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.430
 continue on our smokehouse 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.540
 for this, I came up with not to fish 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.900
 fall I came here such here's piece 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.310
 here you see she is intertwined this 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.870
 done in the same way 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 the grill here it is attached to the spring 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.209

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:31.180
 Well, then you can hang it here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.110
 also for this i used the second one 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.840
 mesh from our fan 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:50.260
 which was not good here it is inserted 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.320
 mesh is also inserted here 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:59.840
 there I have already cut sawdust sawdust I 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:06.459
 cut walnut dipped them then 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.459
 We put a bowl of just such over there 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.020
 we pass on a skewer in front of the hole 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:29.160
 insert our 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:32.790
 the fixture that they did so 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.030
 she lives in the hole gets here but 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.220
 so that it does not open, you can of course 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.390
 some lock come up i just 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.660
 screwed all things wire 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:52.459
 insert yourself into an aluminum attack 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.459
 it all happens so here you see 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.600
 You can also insert these skewers 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:13.560
 if you thought up 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:15.299
