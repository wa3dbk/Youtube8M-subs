00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.690 
don't think we should be putting world
warcraft<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.200> same<00:02:25.410> level<00:02:25.440> as<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> war

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
warcraft on the same level as the war

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.130 
warcraft on the same level as the war
craft<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.060> came<00:02:27.180> before<00:02:27.360> them<00:02:27.660> because

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
craft that came before them because

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.810 
craft that came before them because
they're<00:02:28.920> different<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.170> i<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
they're different and i think that the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.540 
they're different and i think that the
warcraft<00:02:33.360> deserves<00:02:34.350> its<00:02:34.560> place<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.130> its<00:02:35.310> name

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
warcraft deserves its place and its name

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.740 
warcraft deserves its place and its name
and<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.790> don't<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.450> should<00:02:36.600> just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and I don't think that it should just

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
and I don't think that it should just
fade<00:02:36.990> into<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.459> background<00:02:40.220> because<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.310> know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
fade into the background because I know

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.830 
fade into the background because I know
a<00:02:41.459> lot<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.640> people<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.910> still<00:02:42.120> play<00:02:42.330> warcraft

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
