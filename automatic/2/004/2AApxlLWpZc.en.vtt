00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello so this time the video will be 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.730
 a little bit chaotic 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.859
 because I'm going to test age of one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 lessor 3 the problem being that it's 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.300
 a demo version that I caught on 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 internet and I do not know if it's a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.010
 porting or if it's really a version 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 which was made for mac because that's 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.160
 just a horror already it's a wrestler 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.320
 it really swells me but the biggest 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.740
 worry just ended 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.940
 there is no text no so I have 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.570
 wanted to change the graphics settings 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.040
 of the game so I go as an option there is 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 still no text 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.940
 so I ended up finding the menu that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 is here for the graphical options the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.610
 game but there is no longer any 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 text 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.850
 so good ben I activated a lot of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 little things without really knowing what 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.870
 it was to change the resolution of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 the screen 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 no idea so we'll tell the friend of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.270
 this because this is a see this 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.359
 that it will change something 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.500
 yes, because that's when you 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.359
 also cheat my you have a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.119
 error message but without the message 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.220
 of error it's just the box it's up to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.659
 practice 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.689
 that's it if we want to sail then 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.840
 me the pictures of the game I already know 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.970
 fort boyard 3 but I have not played since 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:25.049
 this time we will have fun 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:29.549
 so listen I think we'll start 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.659
 the first game mode that's where he goes 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 have to teach us to play I think 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.280
 the site 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 this is the English version in louvres 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:51.060
 before starting up small set 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 point there then good hurts aulas when a 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.930
 stop to blow braid good start already on 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.479
 see at the level of the waves that bah it's 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.360
 fluid at the same time to joe his lessor 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.659
 is a game that is now a few 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.340
 years 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.740
 no it's the same not going to make me a tutorial 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 every time I replace and a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.989
 hedge and balloons I can even starting 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:19.209
 Menuge and games not text 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:22.209
 so you do not noble he goes there good listening and 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.049
 one in any case the way they themselves 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.049
 move as very correctly 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 that's the way the character gets 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.290
 move bah listen it's really 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 fluid 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.739
 compared to the windows version that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.440
 I used before and that I used in 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.269
 done there is still not super long time there 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.409
 there is no change 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.720
 at the same time it does not surprise me too much because 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.030
 that the mcs makes big games turn 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.180
 like the big ones of thoroughly then a game 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.620
 as age of empires iii or that's what 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.049
 should not be really a problem 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.030
 I'm looking for a little fight 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:04.299
 something but in any case if you 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.859
 have a french version of jo fire 3 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.470
 or 6 to you have a correct version 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.859
 that works know that the game 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.329
 will run perfectly well 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.829
 in view of what the game requires as 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.980
 graphical resources and then that 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.829
 the adam mac sell it at the passage I 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.400
 turns round and it annoys me either 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:28.540
 mountains and tree care from to 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.530
 the little corner statement explore I'm going 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.720
 maybe had to listen to what they say 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.739
 is the guy on the coast 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.569
 finally good where I have little guys 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.640
 who arrived this may have been the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:44.190
 common purpose 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.690
 so, well, that's it, I think 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.120
 this the fastest test of all the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.590
 creating at least the fastest of all 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.110
 my usual tests there will be a quarter 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.920
 of bike time what does it do to 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.920
 hardly five minutes 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:03.030
 what is this blinking menu 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.530
 abbaoui hammami who are funny bomb at 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.570
 that if it were to be the thing to be the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:12.709
 goals a little my song lying there 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.709
 dialogue bubbles without dialogues 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:29.190
 past saw it on the left the new flag 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:30.360
 pay this well yeah but there's even 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.480
 not texts there either but it's 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.500
 clear to the texts in the game then 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.840
 listen here you've already had this 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.820
 problem with a video game because 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.200
 it does not come from the mac because I have 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.300
 problems like that on windows when 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.290
 I install a stuff pouf deputy is 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.190
 nothing or no one else so if you 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.680
 know where it comes from 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.190
 at the limit I am a taker then 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.919
 do not hesitate to leave it what I have 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.090
 spent two days yes the amount of my 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.950
 resources also does not display 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.410
 sellin practice to play a game of 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.760
 real-time strategy 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.220
 short so I said to go back to Lille 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.380
 umpteenth time that if you know where it comes from 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.060
 this kind of problem do not hesitate to the 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.550
 put in the comments of this 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.919
 video I would be very happy to 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.479
 To learn it 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.700
 Well listen on this I will not 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.840
 let villagers work for two 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.950
 hours to the extent that I would not know 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.590
 not even what revolts me 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.850
 I'm just going to stop this 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.810
 test right now and then to go 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.770
 swim in my corner 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.770
 Good evening
