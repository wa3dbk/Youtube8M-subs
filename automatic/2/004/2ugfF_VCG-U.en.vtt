really really really high up and the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.039 
really really really high up and the
ball<00:03:54.610> flies<00:03:54.970> like<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.510> instead<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.930> just

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
ball flies like this instead of just

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.840 
ball flies like this instead of just
shooting<00:03:56.470> forward<00:03:56.860> he<00:03:56.950> shoots<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.610> really

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
shooting forward he shoots it really

happened<00:03:58.180> every<00:03:58.480> time<00:03:58.510> swoosh<00:03:59.049> Haruko<00:03:59.650> said

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
happened every time swoosh Haruko said

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.009 
happened every time swoosh Haruko said
he<00:04:00.010> has<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.130> hundred<00:04:00.580> percent<00:04:00.700> accuracy<00:04:01.390> so<00:04:01.840> he

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
he has a hundred percent accuracy so he

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.229 
he has a hundred percent accuracy so he
never<00:04:02.290> misses<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.700> reason<00:04:03.850> why<00:04:04.090> he

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
never misses and the reason why he

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.240 
never misses and the reason why he
shoots<00:04:04.510> up<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.230> high<00:04:05.410> is<00:04:05.470> because<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:06.010> totally

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
shoots up so high is because it totally

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.940 
shoots up so high is because it totally
