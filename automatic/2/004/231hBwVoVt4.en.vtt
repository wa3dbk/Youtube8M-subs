and one is in the shape of I can assume

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.780 
and one is in the shape of I can assume
is<00:03:41.160> Jo

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
is Jo

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.940 
is Jo
should<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.270> guess<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.750> Morton<00:03:43.050> Jo<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.680> should

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
should we guess it's Morton Jo we should

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.660 
should we guess it's Morton Jo we should
assume<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.950> know<00:03:47.040> maybe<00:03:47.250> if<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.490> keep

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
assume but you know maybe if we keep

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.570 
assume but you know maybe if we keep
reading<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:48.060> we'll<00:03:48.540> find<00:03:49.140> out<00:03:49.440> who<00:03:50.400> these

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
reading on we'll find out who these

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.210

people<00:03:50.640> are<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.570> read<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.950> solve

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
people are and we read on will solve
