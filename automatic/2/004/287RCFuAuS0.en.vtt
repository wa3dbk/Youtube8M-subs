00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.670
 Hey guys, in this video I want to show you how to make him 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.870
 May made it 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.500
 a small speaker unit can build and you play only six 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.519
 a man a man like that I used too 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.060
 and I want to talk about why you have the speed 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.239
 and how it is built 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.869
 he is my little example 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.869
 we do here HTC uses Roland Rothmann 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.350
 and the Rheintaler so if we press this switch 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.630
 then the signal goes on but only for a short moment 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.090
 always only as long as switch pressed 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.000
 Lüthi for example a few 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 Have portraits and we have on a purchase on it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.900
 then we can force back what you do for it 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.450
 and then it works out again but what do you want because we want that 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.790
 remains 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.350
 then viruses could 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.480
 one 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.710
 Shepherd 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.370
 that looks like this 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.870
 Now you can flip the switch and it remains exciting as long as failed 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.820
 is laid 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.590
 and make that out again 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 Clit out 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.570
 the problem is appreciated if we have several now 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 Failure just want each other and we want to build a system 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.160
 whatever 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.090
 a pressed button last and all others not then we would have if we 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.870
 have these switches 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.970
 Everywhere Marlene goes it fails to make it 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.810
 and then want to make Iran at the appropriate counter 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.240
 to do after another 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.540
 So who rest first then the evening 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.060
 it is a bit awkward and 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.570
 around 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.060
 "Of course it's better if we have a charge to meet Aabar 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.640
 it does not stay off 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.940
 and there can be a Asbeck boss Matthias l it has prank 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.070
 Prüm the state 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 Nantes Brixton Graz 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.650
 avoid the sign as a lecturer I can easily with 2 dealers 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.869
 Andy the rest of the torches hang on meant amalgam 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 and in between we use and rest 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.069
 this system is holding itself now 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.790
 the self-sustaining 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.080
 yes, this is a signal from torches that never speak first 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.989
 turned on so it is turned off and here as well 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.299
 Now, just so grazing these facts is all these facts are out 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.810
 and precisely because in this fake is out in St 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.550
 this roadmap more the system is more or less in keeping with this 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.559
 Feedback that we have made 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.319
 independently upright 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.539
 around 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.739
 but how do you manage now that the system is switched, for example 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.039
 that disturb there 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.839
 This is quite simple 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.100
 namely, by 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.089
 easy here 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.669
 around 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.239
 Here simply create a signal at the here a signal was created 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.119
 yes, then these falconers would go out 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 and because this is then out of that, and vice versa, Lorber 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.759
 the problem with format 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.669
 make knot 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.669
 so seen gives demand lights up now put on a signal 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.369
 Walla 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.869
 the backlight 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.519
 and that stays that way now 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.939
 yes, because just this feedback have these facts 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.979
 and that's why this piglet is off 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.689
 and that's why it's 60 years old 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.689
 through the feedback Inception I upright 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.609
 and now for example we have pressed this button and now 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:29.359
 shines 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 every drop the screen with the stepped 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.780
 define our exit 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.019
 Na and Cnet young man 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.929
 and you can do it for example 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.929
 Machinarium 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.099
 around 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.339
 Alu 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.339
 around 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.159
 each pressed and how do the rail air 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:54.990
 although the button 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.669
 not pressed anymore 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.519
 To get it done now is turned off that's easy 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.349
 because maybe we're doing this on this page because that's where I am 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.849
 now here 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.779
 insert a signal 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.549
 then this torch goes out and with this torch off it goes to this 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.849
 and so on and so on the system only that he is quite upright 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.189
 the magazine low 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.059
 so 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.059
 Knittlingen 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.169
 to move up to the NWZ 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.559
 or power applied 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.360
 this piglet has run away now 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.469
 under it are 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.860
 the signal that way and so we can build a system Waas March the whole 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.029
 normal knot 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.819
 all five are 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.979
 and the SGS world then saves the status even more 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.449
 depressingly hoping 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.360
 and it shines permanently 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.900
 pressing on it 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.020
 and that it's from Grossbardorf 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.680
 because in every song contest 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.809
 very important 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:59.069
 Not 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.249
 the Redstone consultant on top 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.289
 that has me at a disadvantage 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.159
 the lady the line we use as an entrance at neither knocked off 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.620
 wear 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.360
 also works as output then 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.719
 yes, these lines shine then just because here 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.719
 have made a connection above this block 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.930
 that's how her shelf of his we see is working too 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.650
 so again fresh herbs and now that I'm here head of the entrance 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.370
 the mark this system still work 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.520
 but if you go now and 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.430
 This PS charging unit integrates a more complex circuit 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.269
 In order for this declining he can almost cause problems if that happens 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:45.900
 Signal goes back to others 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.460
 and then you change something there 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.400
 the dissolution should be triggered 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.170
 therefore the input and output should always be separate 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.789
 and that is achieved by giving life 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.039
 above no restaurant trot made yes the subjects against here one 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.779
 Average not suspected entrance where the German team with 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:06.699
 press the button 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.699
 just for a brief moment entrance 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:11.830
 expenditure 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.219
 that separately 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.509
 and so does the network game 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.770
 if you have any questions he simply puts them in the comments otherwise 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.819
 thank you for watching
