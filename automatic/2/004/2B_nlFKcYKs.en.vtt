00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:08.620
 Hi Wongil video today is an ancient video . 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.550
 Today, Daejeon is reset, and now it's full of natural bosses. 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.740
 I wrote on the flame boss last time I lie down in Lerang Garren and score better 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.810
 I'll try it out. 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:23.320
 Garen came out well enough, but against the natural booth, 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 I'll see if you can get your score. 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:32.289
 I'll try to play the game the same as the last time. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.179
 This time, at that I'll get to see these days 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:40.600
 If you go to the bottom of the sparrow, you'll only have a little bit of a score 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:44.290
 He was next to me. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.280
 Lastly, the case of the lower salt boss is floating type. 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.170
 I had a cranberry predominate , 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.920
 Because it is still 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:59.080
 Who'll come out a better taste is'll see 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:04.379
 Now the slime came out, and if it is the same, 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.379
 I put the car in slime magazine because it's coming out. 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.710
 I'll go up almost the same score early on . 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.480
 Because the ball is almost the same, the damage is almost the same 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.480
 It's the same. 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:29.619
 Pyeongta case scenario is when the New Year like that jidaga converted into a fist 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:35.049
 If you click on the other side there is a switch just like the wind faded back 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:37.689
 It is a type that pushes forward slightly, 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:43.030
 When a delay occurs 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:45.520
 When you take the lift to give her in advance the number of other blood sucking properly expand itneunge 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.090
 It could be a point. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.659
 So far, the score is a bit similar. 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.640
 Now came the look is little point nearly 60,000 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.060
 Before the first few ad breaks, you'll see that your score is almost the same 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.060
 I will. 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.670
 Lee now looks a little something down garen the pcb and teojimyeo only have 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:16.140
 Because I follow you 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:20.700
 4 Now that I'm going to go this way , 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.580
 Because of this, the dps can be stretched 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.500
 I'll look the same gatguyo 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.930
 I got 75,000 points , so in the early part of the year, 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.810
 I liked it so much in the second half. 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.680
 Now, 360,000 have passed both . 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.110
 It's about 10 minutes past the end of the line. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.260
 I can not do it right now. 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:51.380
 If you keep the same speed that the faster LAN doeseo laminator is inevitable when nulreojwoya 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.480
 It's a good fit for repairs. 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.780
 When I play , it's a little bit different after 10 minutes. 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780
 hurry 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.440
 There's a difference up to half a thousand in the class now . 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:11.150
 Eloy case, also because of their considerably one way selector 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.150
 I think it's a good idea to do it . 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.530
 Ah, if it's the same, it's passive, but it's quite wide. 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.540
 The watchmen came and gagged. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.990
 4 When it breaks 400,000 won first , it differs more than 20,000 youth already 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.990
 Started. 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 For dps is that there can be almost the same as hitting a fall at that pyeongta 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.290
 This group played since after that at 20 minutes, the fewer the better the score Li 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.390
 I think you do. 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:51.260
 Yes, both are so nearly the same when finishing 12 minutes 30 seconds dwaetguyo 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:56.120
 The score is about 20,000 different. 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:59.750
 It is almost the same up to 10 minutes but the speed of maintenance is getting faster. 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.310
 Looks like me and then re-viscosity breaking down easy starting 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 I'll do the video on here.
