00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.430
 already having copied the contents of the folder of your duty to the telephone 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.029
 now we proceed to download some applications from the market 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.210
 before that it's good to take a look 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.599
 to the phone to confirm that we are in the version 1 points 5 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.640
 it is a sum of configuration 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.829
 about of the phone 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.380
 deer version 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.380
 uu 1 points and nz moment 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.190
 1 points 5 also known as 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.540
 and as we see in our original software in this case 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 movilnet 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.530
 the phone has no application installed proper note 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.230
 it has nothing 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.360
 the application is only that the phone comes from the factory 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.500
 Soon we will see what will be or will change with the new applications 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 dismantle that in general there will be three 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
 first against macarÃ¡ challenges on Tuesday 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.409
 frequent in an active data connection and in this case explained a uefa e 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.790
 if we do not have the fae by 180 of 3% enable your data connection the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.830
 phone 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.240
 is very important still without any connection we will never be able to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 download the applications that you will install in this month 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.090
 little more than first application 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 space 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.520
 with this is more than enough we give the announcer mouth 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.870
 a list appears 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.030
 the one that interests me is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.690
 that was the explorer 1 points 5 d is this 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.650
 other sections 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530
 the bad option he used 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.530
 installed 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.039
 to accept 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.039
 that download film files at hours 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.299
 pekin navarra notifications news 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 when it is correctly 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.289
 the explanation 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 let's sit down correctly 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.999
 we are every other application hour 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.419
 we return to the main screen 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.209
 we search 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 we write you 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.499
 to have 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.909
 min 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.819
 the mayor 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.109
 space 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.589
 percent 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 the 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.009
 impresses again in the magnifying glass 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.049
 oscar the application or 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.430
 this errand ready in theory anybody does not serve 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.819
 but the one I use this ended the moment or technology 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.139
 same as the previous itamar 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.899
 to accept 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.229
 it was installed correctly 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.019
 we would already be roasted application 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.400
