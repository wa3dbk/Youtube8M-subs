00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
my opinion it doesn't really make a
difference<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.960> only<00:01:07.140> time<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.590> will

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
difference the only time it will

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
difference the only time it will
actually<00:01:08.010> matter<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.390> playing

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the campers I play against they have a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.240 
the campers I play against they have a
reaction<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.119> zero<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> none<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.250> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
know just just take advantage of that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.859 
know just just take advantage of that
it's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> great<00:01:58.950> idea<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.600> saying

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it's a great idea and I'm not saying

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
it's a great idea and I'm not saying
that<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.290> hating<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.680> campus<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.549> my

that I'm hating on campus but that's my

that I'm hating on campus but that's my
general<00:02:03.259> that's<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.469> general<00:02:04.680> idea<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.219> what

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
general that's my general idea of what

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.760 
general that's my general idea of what
campers<00:02:05.880> reaction<00:02:06.329> time<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:07.049> most

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
campers reaction time is that's most

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
campers reaction time is that's most
though<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.610> most<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> campers<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
though that's most of the campers that I

though that's most of the campers that I
play<00:02:09.660> against<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.140> just

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
play against they just

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.910 
play against they just
have<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> good<00:02:11.440> reaction<00:02:11.590> time<00:02:13.140> blame<00:02:14.140> them<00:02:14.410> but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
a different position so I'm going to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.830

support<00:02:40.930> I'm<00:02:41.350> not<00:02:41.590> gonna<00:02:41.740> get<00:02:41.890> mad<00:02:42.070> about<00:02:42.220> that

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
support I'm not gonna get mad about that

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.550 
support I'm not gonna get mad about that
because<00:02:42.700> that's<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.300> great<00:02:43.660> strategy<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.380> play

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
because that's a great strategy to play

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.590 
because that's a great strategy to play
the<00:02:44.710> game<00:02:44.860> although<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.730> know<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.300> much

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
the game although you know it's much

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.720 
the game although you know it's much
better<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.960> do<00:02:47.770> more<00:02:47.980> killing<00:02:48.400> than<00:02:48.520> shooting

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
better to do more killing than shooting

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.610 
better to do more killing than shooting
down<00:02:48.940> air<00:02:49.120> support<00:02:49.480> because<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.320> can<00:02:50.440> shoot

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
down air support because you can shoot

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.990 
down air support because you can shoot
down<00:02:50.650> all<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.190> air<00:02:51.310> support<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> world

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
down all the air support in the world

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.400 
down all the air support in the world
but<00:02:52.150> if<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.300> don't<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.600> any<00:02:52.780> kills<00:02:53.050> you're

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
but if you don't get any kills you're

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.260 
but if you don't get any kills you're
not<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.830> win<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.070> game<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.910> try<00:02:55.240> to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
not going to win the game so try to

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.260 
not going to win the game so try to
balance<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.990> two<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.230> maybe<00:02:57.030> try<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.090> you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
balance the two and maybe try to you

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.360 
balance the two and maybe try to you
know<00:02:58.300> shoot<00:02:58.660> down<00:02:58.810> air<00:02:58.990> support<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.770> then<00:03:00.010> try

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
know shoot down air support and then try

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.430 
know shoot down air support and then try
to<00:03:00.400> get<00:03:00.550> some<00:03:00.700> kills<00:03:00.940> because<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.900> you're<00:03:02.110> all

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440

you<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.130> all<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.460> one<00:03:04.030> or<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.300> other<00:03:04.330> it's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
you know all of one or the other it's

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.250 
you know all of one or the other it's
gonna<00:03:05.020> be<00:03:05.200> hard<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.530> do<00:03:05.890> good<00:03:06.580> now<00:03:07.330> right<00:03:07.810> now

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
going to try to find a gun if I can and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.090 
going to try to find a gun if I can and
you<00:04:13.270> can<00:04:13.450> see<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:13.660> i'm<00:04:13.989> using<00:04:14.020> these<00:04:14.500> tanks

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.300 
you can see that i'm using these tanks
for<00:04:15.280> cover<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.790> looks<00:04:15.970> as<00:04:16.150> if

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
for cover it looks as if

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.789 
for cover it looks as if
nuke<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:18.000> went<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:18.660> over<00:04:18.930> in<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.500> area

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
nuke that went on over in this area

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.099 
nuke that went on over in this area
that's<00:04:20.220> probably<00:04:20.700> why<00:04:20.970> there<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.359> radiation

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
that's probably why there is radiation

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.970 
that's probably why there is radiation

more<00:05:07.080> favorable<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.430> lung<00:05:08.700> to

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
more favorable to the lung to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.040 
more favorable to the lung to
medium-range<00:05:10.850> battles<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.270> short-range
