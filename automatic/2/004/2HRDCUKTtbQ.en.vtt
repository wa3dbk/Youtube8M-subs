chatter<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.520> unrolling<00:01:38.970> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
chatter you know are they unrolling this

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.690 
chatter you know are they unrolling this
now<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.930> sales<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.619> weak<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.400> quite

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
now because sales are weak I'm not quite

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
now because sales are weak I'm not quite
sure<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> an

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
sure about that I think that this is an

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.030 
sure about that I think that this is an
effort<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.009> make<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.500> viral

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
effort to make use of a really viral

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
effort to make use of a really viral
customer<00:01:47.759> base<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.360> already<00:01:48.720> doing

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
customer base that is already doing

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
customer base that is already doing
virtual<00:01:49.890> marketing<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.369> behalf<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
virtual marketing on behalf of the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.760 
virtual marketing on behalf of the
company<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.390> why<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.229> reward<00:01:52.590> them

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
company and why not kind of reward them

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.220 
company and why not kind of reward them
for<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.130> um

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
for that um

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.890 
for that um
you<00:01:54.920> know<00:01:55.040> we<00:01:55.220> won't<00:01:55.340> know<00:01:55.610> until<00:01:55.900> some

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
you know we won't know until some

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.750 
you know we won't know until some
guidance<00:01:57.230> on<00:01:57.440> next<00:01:57.710> week<00:01:57.830> earnings<00:01:58.190> call<00:01:58.430> what

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
guidance on next week earnings call what

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.520 
guidance on next week earnings call what
what<00:01:59.150> forecasts<00:01:59.750> are<00:01:59.810> looking<00:02:00.110> like<00:02:00.260> for<00:02:00.440> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
what forecasts are looking like for the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.260 
what forecasts are looking like for the
year<00:02:00.770> but<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.190> know<00:02:01.280> Tesla<00:02:01.640> has<00:02:01.760> said<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.150> will

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
year but you know Tesla has said it will

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.410 
year but you know Tesla has said it will
sell<00:02:02.570> 55,000<00:02:03.530> cars<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:04.010> year<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:05.120> has<00:02:05.270> to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
sell 55,000 cars this year it has to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.030 
sell 55,000 cars this year it has to
sell<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.750> bulk<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:06.050> those<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.620> back<00:02:06.770> half

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
sell the bulk of those in the back half

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.730 
sell the bulk of those in the back half
and<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:08.300> think<00:02:08.900> that<00:02:08.990> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.260> an<00:02:09.350> effort<00:02:09.590> to

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
and I think that this is an effort to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.950 
and I think that this is an effort to
kind<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.040> see<00:02:10.670> whether<00:02:10.850> virtual<00:02:11.300> marketing<00:02:11.810> is

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
kind of see whether virtual marketing is

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.050 
kind of see whether virtual marketing is
maybe<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.350> stronger<00:02:12.860> avenue<00:02:13.250> for<00:02:13.460> Tesla<00:02:13.820> than

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
maybe a stronger avenue for Tesla than

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.630 
maybe a stronger avenue for Tesla than
advertising<00:02:14.690> or<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> retail<00:02:15.500> operation<00:02:16.070> well

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
advertising or the retail operation well

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.190 
advertising or the retail operation well
talk<00:02:16.820> about<00:02:17.090> though<00:02:17.240> how<00:02:17.420> important<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
talk about though how important the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.950 
talk about though how important the
Tesla<00:02:18.680> drivers<00:02:19.250> are<00:02:19.640> versus<00:02:20.240> say<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.570> drivers

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
Tesla drivers are versus say the drivers

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.680 
Tesla drivers are versus say the drivers
of<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.440> Volkswagen<00:02:22.100> or<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.370> BMW<00:02:23.270> what's<00:02:23.540> their

of a Volkswagen or a BMW what's their

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.590 
of a Volkswagen or a BMW what's their
power<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:25.640> hugely<00:02:25.970> important<00:02:26.450> because

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
power it's hugely important because

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.170 
power it's hugely important because
electric<00:02:27.500> drivetrain<00:02:28.310> technology<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:28.910> still

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
electric drivetrain technology is still

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180 
electric drivetrain technology is still
relatively<00:02:29.600> new<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:30.140> most<00:02:30.350> consumers<00:02:30.710> well

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
relatively new for most consumers well

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.040 
relatively new for most consumers well
certainly<00:02:31.730> more<00:02:32.030> electric<00:02:32.480> cars<00:02:32.660> are<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
certainly more electric cars are on the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.720 
certainly more electric cars are on the
roads<00:02:33.230> today<00:02:33.530> than<00:02:33.860> there<00:02:33.950> were<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> decade<00:02:34.610> ago

roads today than there were a decade ago

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.640 
roads today than there were a decade ago
it's<00:02:35.210> new<00:02:35.390> technology<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.260> takes<00:02:36.470> people

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
it's new technology and it takes people

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.930 
it's new technology and it takes people
quite<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.070> long<00:02:37.250> time<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.610> feel<00:02:37.760> comfortable

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
quite a long time to feel comfortable

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.300 
quite a long time to feel comfortable
with<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:38.780> if<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:39.290> neighbor<00:02:39.530> or<00:02:39.950> your<00:02:39.980> boss

or<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:46.220> know<00:02:46.310> let<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.610> borrow<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.270> day

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
or you know let you borrow it for a day

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.010 
or you know let you borrow it for a day
that's<00:02:48.290> huge<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.460> saves<00:02:49.790> Tesla<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
that's huge and that saves Tesla the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.150 
that's huge and that saves Tesla the
money<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.410> they<00:02:51.500> would<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.740> spend<00:02:52.040> on

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
money that they would have to spend on

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920 
money that they would have to spend on
their<00:02:52.250> own<00:02:52.400> sales<00:02:52.700> operation<00:02:53.330> doing<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.720> same

their own sales operation doing the same

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.320 
their own sales operation doing the same
so<00:02:54.380> I've<00:02:55.070> been<00:02:55.220> at<00:02:55.340> conferences<00:02:55.760> where<00:02:56.000> owners

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
so I've been at conferences where owners

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210 
so I've been at conferences where owners
have<00:02:56.570> stood<00:02:56.750> up<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.140> steel<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.590> must<00:02:57.800> directly

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
have stood up in a steel I must directly

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190 
have stood up in a steel I must directly
you<00:02:58.610> know<00:02:58.700> where's<00:02:58.940> our<00:02:59.209> incentive<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.870> live<00:03:00.110> in

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
you know where's our incentive I live in

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.050 
you know where's our incentive I live in
Atlanta<00:03:00.260> i<00:03:00.800> personally<00:03:01.100> know<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.670> i've<00:03:01.760> sold

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
Atlanta i personally know that i've sold

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.210 
Atlanta i personally know that i've sold
five<00:03:02.330> cars<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.080> i<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:03.740> this<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
five cars and i think this is the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.100 
five cars and i think this is the
company<00:03:04.580> realizing<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:05.420> they<00:03:05.780> could<00:03:05.930> make

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
company realizing that they could make

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.720 
company realizing that they could make
better<00:03:06.320> use<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.590> their<00:03:06.860> customer<00:03:07.340> base<00:03:07.370> then

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
better use of their customer base then

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.510 
better use of their customer base then
they<00:03:07.820> have<00:03:07.970> been<00:03:08.240> thus<00:03:08.480> far
