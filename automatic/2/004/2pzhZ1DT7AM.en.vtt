00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.690
 Hi everyone guys, so I'm sorry 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 for this light a bit disgusting for the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.400
 shadows but unfortunately it is raining here 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.080
 making a flood the sun disappeared and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.699
 so all I have to do is turn on 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.949
 artificial light I know it is not the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.869
 maximum however much you don't have to do anyway 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.800
 looking myself in the face you will only see the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.900
 my hands and with 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.930
 do not miss the shadow of mine 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.449
 look here then I'll talk about a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.920
 topic I've never talked to 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.430
 my videos 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.250
 we say that perhaps it would also be time to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.829
 talk about it because the topic in question 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.379
 in perspective 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.329
 I had decided to split this video 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.760
 in two parts in the first part vi 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.829
 I will talk to you I will make a historical smattering 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.120
 of what is the perspective in the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.629
 second part instead we will see 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.289
 practically how do you make it 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.359
 so first let's say something 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.920
 fundamental we start from the origin from 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.920
 term perspective then the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.560
 perspective is a term that derives from the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.720
 Latin reject what it means to see 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.240
 distinctly with this term indeed 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.270
 we usually indicate that set of 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.390
 projections on a two-dimensional plane of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.420
 objects that instead of me 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 have 3 this means that through this 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.560
 procedure can be represented 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.149
 any object on a sheet and the way 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.670
 as truthful as possible 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.349
 much confusion often occurs with the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.000
 figure of filippo brunelli is likely to 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:35.319
 leon battista alberti these because 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.050
 both have to do with the 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.349
 perspective but only to 1 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.800
 we can know his paternity in 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:47.110
 as the creator of the perspective or 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.599
 filippo brunelleschi giano who to look for 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.610
 to orientate yourself a little on the figure 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.360
 by filippo brunelleschi 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.429
 for those who still do not know him 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.979
 we can say first of all that filippo 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.440
 brunelleschi together with a beat st 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.720
 alberti and masaccio were certainly 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.149
 the key figures of the early Renaissance 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.310
 filippo brunelleschi his architect e 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.170
 accusations against him are precisely the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.190
 realization of the bola of santa maria 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.230
 of the flower while Leon Battista Alberti 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.030
 he was a well-rounded character 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.160
 until tomorrow 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.700
 He was a painter and a man of letters 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.020
 architect and filippo brunelleschi ai 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.270
 starts in the first decade of 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.790
 four hundred discover the rules of 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.959
 geometrical representation 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.640
 perspective making two tablets 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.270
 prospects just unfortunately gone 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.230
 lost 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.640
 it is in the baptistery of Florence 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.830
 seen from the cathedral santa maria del 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.250
 flower is a vision of old palace 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.650
 together with the nearby lodge loggia 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.480
 unfortunately as I told you these two 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.180
 these two tablets have been lost 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.910
 but I sit on the book an image that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.459
 depicts the baptistery of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.320
 florence which is then nothing but one 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.230
 reconstruction of this tablet though 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.930
 you must now during the video indeed 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.870
 right now you will see these 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.140
 images so you can see them give 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.140
 quick View 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.239
 and these long runs 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.159
 achievements in the perspective of 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.260
 brunelleschi because there were so many 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.349
 they were simplified by a Baptist 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.230
 trees a very famous treaty that was 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.989
 it was called the de pictura 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.260
 that is painting where it is called la 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.760
 abbreviated construction perspective 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.120
 precisely to synthesize all phases 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.099
 graphics say of the perspective 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.480
 therefore in this treatise leon 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.430
 battista alberti acknowledges a 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.150
 brunelleschi the priority of this 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.120
 discovery therefore a fundamental thing 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.250
 that in the fifteenth century finally i 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.010
 artistic must have a method 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.519
 scientifically proven with concrete 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.109
 for the realization of their works in 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.870
 a period where the main task 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.040
 the artist was not alone 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.769
 limitations of nature but also the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.810
 knowledge of nature itself at 360 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.489
 degrees that hints of perspective of 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.259
 places we can also see in the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.630
 Giotto painting that stands out 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.440
 very much from the reading of his master 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.780
 which was precisely that of cimabue that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.250
 obviously it's a type painting 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.110
 two-dimensional made precisely on a 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.020
 support of the same type ie me 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.330
 dimensional nothing I hope for so much 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.550
 to have been clear to have been 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.550
 I hope pleasant and not boring 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.669
 see you in the second part of the video 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.940
 where I talk to you about 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.300
 practical realization of perspective 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.370
 I send you a big kiss and I thank you 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.200
 for patience since they are anyway 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.710
 been a little distant from youtube to 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.630
 family business causes 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.250
 however , thank you very much not 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.990
 I'll never finish thanking you for yours 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.300
 sign up for your comments 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.640
 often left on the canal 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.090
 I'll send you a big kiss see you at 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.090
 next I want
