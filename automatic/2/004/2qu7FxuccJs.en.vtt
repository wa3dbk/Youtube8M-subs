00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.859
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.859
 look at 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.090
 I'll show you the circle stitch today 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.779
 the color change on the right side 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.710
 At the circle stab one stings from behind 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:32.160
 in the vertical loop of the mesh 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.670
 So one from behind the proposals in this 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.100
 plug in and pull the thread 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.280
 pull through 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.280
 on the back it looks like this 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:54.980
 the vertical sling becomes respectively 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.980
 only to get through the thread 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.259
 at the end no additional some 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.429
 work but immediately through the first 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.530
 pull two loops the thread and then 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.729
 as usual, there are two slings 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 to do together 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.920
 now for color change the last loop 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.650
 already with the new vahr with the new 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.150
 markdowns color and again from behind 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.150
 to grasp the stitches 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.579
 the dough awarded again 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 and like the rides through the first 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.230
 pull two loops 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:51.080
 and now the new thread again before the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.000
 first in front of the old and the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.019
 last two loop together 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 wash it off and start again 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:09.340
 shown with the green thread from the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.340
 lianas loop the most watch out 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.200
