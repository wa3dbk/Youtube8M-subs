00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.659
 it's the first time he's in the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.689
 weekly rotation since it is the last 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:35.650

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.780
 current position which we see today 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.480
 more not more often and good in three 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.460
 why

 three good 3 and all the champions that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.970
 they come out again they are always approved in 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.340
 Many lines are always worth trying in 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.900
 a lot of lines are approved in mid 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.280
 double legend 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.670

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.320
 the same 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.950
 I believe 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.620
 for more video 3 is a super tank 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.360
 they support that its very good I've seen 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.720
 there are also people who wear it like 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.600
 carry too but I do not see it 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.670
 I see guys but hey I see 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.930
 like a tank and its goal plus a 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.820
 very good support thanks to which it from 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.369

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.340

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.690
 eg flashlight is very or Pilla 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.159
 last has that slows down a 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.289
 barbarity is very very open 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.259
 good news we have a couple of 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.450
 news has already left the former Plaza Art 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.579
 the new skin of james and the one of bliss 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.560
 craft is worth not having commented before 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.939
 but good is already next to the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 you will be seeing on screen right now 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.750
 the one of devon james that in Spanish 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.399
 called james gallardo and the great blitz 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 and big blake in Spanish is going to be 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.460
 the same and bridge and bliss tran forgiveness 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.549

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.350
 the spell a look at your abilities in 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.040
 James does not change much his skills 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.590
 explain if they change more 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.769
 and well I think that they change it a 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.180
 couple of skills and little more good and 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.219
 for the last news I come to talk to you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.370
 of the control loss bars and 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.750
 of the increase of the life bars of 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.970
 100 to 200 voucher 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.290
 many will not know what the bars are 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.290
 of loss of control but good is going to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.660
 leave now below below life 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.000
 when you are stunned 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.640
 there is an aerial shoot you have the fear 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.110
 opposite is going to leave a life in a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.700
 bar forgiveness which will indicate 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.250
 the seconds that will last you 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.180
 stun or that loss of control 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.129
 rather 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.319
 and good about life what you already 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.409
 I said it was 100 it happened to be 200 and 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.060
 well some many people were not 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.840
 agree to that change 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.239
 because they did not like it and other people 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.560
 they said that in a few weeks they were going to 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.920
 get used to but I was not going to 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920
 be the same 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.680
 these changes are not going to be applied in the 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.480
 next patch they communicated this 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.700
 same morning and I read something that I think 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.099
 that in the end those of the bars of life 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.319
 they were going to put it optional I think I do not know if 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.319
 it is safe, no, do not pay much attention to me 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.540
 even because I'm not 100% confirmed 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:33.209
 ok and that maybe it was better 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.030
 of optional you could blind it to 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.519
 200 as you would like and good guys with 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.290
