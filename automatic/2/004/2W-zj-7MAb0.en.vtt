00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the guy's HP Pavilion one seven two

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.230 
the guy's HP Pavilion one seven two
three<00:00:15.230> it's<00:00:16.230> quite<00:00:16.379> an<00:00:16.500> old<00:00:16.619> LCD<00:00:17.100> monitor<00:00:17.520> but

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
three it's quite an old LCD monitor but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
three it's quite an old LCD monitor but
I<00:00:18.949> used<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> use<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:21.800> every<00:00:22.800> time

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
I used to use it and it was every time

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.170 
I used to use it and it was every time
he<00:00:23.100> tried<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> turn<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> would<00:00:24.029> just

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
he tried to turn it on it would just

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.259 
he tried to turn it on it would just
flick<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.689> off<00:00:24.810> which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> common

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
flick on and off which is a common

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.570 
flick on and off which is a common
capacity<00:00:27.269> problem<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> power<00:00:27.990> supply

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
capacity problem in the power supply

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
capacity problem in the power supply
so<00:00:29.580> I'll<00:00:29.670> painstakingly<00:00:30.269> taking<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.750> apart<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so I'll painstakingly taking it apart I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.889 
so I'll painstakingly taking it apart I
believe<00:00:32.009> these<00:00:32.309> are<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> culprits<00:00:34.130> one<00:00:35.899> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
believe these are the culprits one in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.330 
believe these are the culprits one in
particular<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:39.530> sort<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> bulged<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
particular just sort of bulged out of it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
particular just sort of bulged out of it
some<00:00:42.350> shrimp<00:00:43.350> casing<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> I'll<00:00:45.450> try<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
some shrimp casing so I'll try and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
some shrimp casing so I'll try and
change<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.379> look<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> caps<00:00:47.520> aren't

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
change that look at the caps aren't

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.319 
change that look at the caps aren't
they're<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> ones<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.870> gone<00:00:50.090> c92<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
they're the ones that have gone c92 to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
they're the ones that have gone c92 to
there<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.100> see<00:00:53.100> nine<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.820> three<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.590> had<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
there and see nine to three there had to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.990 
there and see nine to three there had to
resort<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> filming<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.760> phone

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
resort to filming this in my phone

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
resort to filming this in my phone
because<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.899> rods<00:00:58.109> bring<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.710> seems<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
because the rods bring up I seems to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
because the rods bring up I seems to
have<00:00:59.309> killed<00:00:59.550> every<00:01:00.030> single<00:01:00.210> SD<00:01:00.629> card<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.050> my

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
have killed every single SD card for my

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.219 
have killed every single SD card for my
camera<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:02.030> decided<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.300> him<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.690> found<00:01:04.049> these

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
camera I decided to him I found these

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
camera I decided to him I found these
two<00:01:05.189> new<00:01:05.430> ones<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> bag

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
two new ones in the bag

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
two new ones in the bag
that's<00:01:07.140> three<00:01:07.439> they're<00:01:09.320> all<00:01:10.320> thousand<00:01:10.860> UF<00:01:11.420> 16

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that's three they're all thousand UF 16

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.130 
that's three they're all thousand UF 16
volts<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.049> 25<00:01:13.500> bucks<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.540> these<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
volts so 25 bucks but these the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.039 
volts so 25 bucks but these the
originals<00:01:16.530> were<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> thousand<00:01:17.100> UF<00:01:17.750> 16<00:01:18.750> volts

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
originals were a thousand UF 16 volts

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
originals were a thousand UF 16 volts
but<00:01:19.200> yeah<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> decided<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.920> keep<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> ones<00:01:20.340> on

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
but yeah I decided to keep the ones on

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
but yeah I decided to keep the ones on
the<00:01:20.700> audio<00:01:21.180> amplifier<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.560> case

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the audio amplifier just in case

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.350 
the audio amplifier just in case
whatever<00:01:23.070> user<00:01:23.659> unlikely

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
whatever user unlikely

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.929 
whatever user unlikely
so<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.570> goes<00:01:27.689> back<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.680> together

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
so what goes back in the back together

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.620 
so what goes back in the back together
this<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> perfect

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
this was actually the perfect

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.060 
this was actually the perfect
opportunity<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.380> show<00:01:31.829> off<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> new<00:01:32.670> multimeter

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
opportunity to show off a new multimeter

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
opportunity to show off a new multimeter
mastic<00:01:36.170> ms-21<00:01:37.170> III<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.090> sermon<00:01:39.329> looks

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
mastic ms-21 III and this sermon looks

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.980 
mastic ms-21 III and this sermon looks
pretty<00:01:39.900> good<00:01:40.820> there's<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.030> fairly<00:01:42.600> reasonably

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
pretty good there's a fairly reasonably

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
pretty good there's a fairly reasonably
priced<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> capacitor

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
priced as well but it's got a capacitor

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
priced as well but it's got a capacitor
tester<00:01:45.000> function<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.200> thought<00:01:46.439> I'd

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
tester function right I just thought I'd

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.889 
tester function right I just thought I'd
check<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> new<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.820> old<00:01:48.030> caps<00:01:48.390> us<00:01:48.720> from

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
check out the new and old caps us from

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.210 
check out the new and old caps us from
the<00:01:48.990> new<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.490> measuring<00:01:52.220> 1,057

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the new one and that's measuring 1,057

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
the new one and that's measuring 1,057
microfarad<00:01:53.670> s--<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.409> nothing

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
microfarad s-- and that's just nothing

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
microfarad s-- and that's just nothing
us<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:55.920> within<00:01:56.250> tolerance<00:01:56.670> certainly<00:01:57.420> good

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
us about within tolerance certainly good

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
us about within tolerance certainly good
enough<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.710> first<00:01:58.890> nerd

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
enough for this and first nerd

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.499 
enough for this and first nerd
test<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> old<00:01:59.850> ones

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.050 

this<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.439> one<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.740> old<00:02:03.890> ones<00:02:05.920> 147

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
this is one of the old ones 147

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.790 
this is one of the old ones 147
microfarads<00:02:08.060> instead<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.450> thousand<00:02:08.899> so

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
microfarads instead of a thousand so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.490 
microfarads instead of a thousand so
that<00:02:09.830> one<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.190> definitely<00:02:10.429> gone<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.319> that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
that one is definitely gone the one that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.199 
that one is definitely gone the one that
was<00:02:12.590> more<00:02:12.739> boldest<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.430> looked<00:02:13.849> fine<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
was more boldest and this looked fine to

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.729 
was more boldest and this looked fine to
me<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:14.360> I'll<00:02:14.629> replace<00:02:14.840> both<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.230> them<00:02:15.319> just<00:02:15.680> to

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
me but I'll replace both of them just to

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.710 
me but I'll replace both of them just to
be<00:02:15.830> sure<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.400> more<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.670> fix<00:02:16.879> it<00:02:17.030> okay

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
be sure and this more just fix it okay

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.050 
be sure and this more just fix it okay
the<00:02:17.870> new<00:02:17.989> caps<00:02:18.290> are<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.650> I've<00:02:19.190> got<00:02:19.370> no<00:02:19.550> doubt<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
the new caps are in I've got no doubt it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.930 
the new caps are in I've got no doubt it
was<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.830> completely<00:02:22.220> dodgy<00:02:22.610> one<00:02:22.790> that

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
was that that completely dodgy one that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.100 
was that that completely dodgy one that
I<00:02:22.970> checked<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.390> meter<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:23.720> was<00:02:23.900> causing

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
I checked on the meter that was causing

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.900 
I checked on the meter that was causing
the<00:02:24.230> problem<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.280> I'll<00:02:25.400> put<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.670> all<00:02:25.819> back

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
the problem so I'll put this all back

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.640 
the problem so I'll put this all back
together<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.840> back<00:02:27.019> together<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.349> think<00:02:27.440> it's

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
together so back together I think it's

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.570 
together so back together I think it's
ready<00:02:27.769> for<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.950> powerup

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.370 

powers<00:02:37.510> up<00:02:37.810> perfectly<00:02:38.320> first<00:02:38.560> time<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:39.190> result

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
powers up perfectly first time we result

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.600 
powers up perfectly first time we result
that<00:02:41.380> wasn't<00:02:41.710> too<00:02:41.920> much<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.250> horrendous<00:02:42.460> job

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
that wasn't too much of a horrendous job

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.300 
that wasn't too much of a horrendous job
either<00:02:42.930> well<00:02:43.930> pop<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.620> stand<00:02:44.920> back<00:02:45.070> on<00:02:45.190> that

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
either well pop the stand back on that

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.010 
either well pop the stand back on that
and<00:02:45.430> put<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.550> back<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> air<00:02:46.440> monitor

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.420 

on<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.110> only<00:02:51.200> problem<00:02:51.560> I've<00:02:51.650> got<00:02:51.680> now<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.370> uh

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
on the only problem I've got now is uh

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.810 
on the only problem I've got now is uh
it's<00:02:53.120> stuck<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.110> loop<00:02:55.070> of<00:02:55.310> people<00:02:55.640> to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
it's stuck in a loop of people to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.660 
it's stuck in a loop of people to
adjusting<00:02:56.770> which<00:02:57.770> is<00:02:57.950> pretty<00:02:58.130> annoying

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
adjusting which is pretty annoying

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.410 
adjusting which is pretty annoying
I<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:59.690> buttons<00:03:00.080> jammed<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.620> that's<00:03:00.830> why<00:03:01.420> okay

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
I just buttons jammed in that's why okay

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.900 
I just buttons jammed in that's why okay
not<00:03:02.720> too<00:03:02.840> much<00:03:02.960> of<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.140> comeback<00:03:03.320> Swick's<00:03:03.910> yeah

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
not too much of a comeback Swick's yeah

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:17.650 
not too much of a comeback Swick's yeah
that's<00:03:05.300> just<00:03:05.540> jammed<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:15.340> one<00:03:16.340> more<00:03:16.520> try<00:03:16.760> there

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that's just jammed in one more try there

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.010 
that's just jammed in one more try there
we<00:03:17.750> go

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
we go

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.670 
we go
all<00:03:18.170> fixed<00:03:18.920> turns<00:03:19.550> out<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.760> Justin<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
all fixed turns out I Justin but the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.790 
all fixed turns out I Justin but the
back<00:03:22.030> screws<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.240> probably<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> bit<00:03:24.380> too<00:03:24.410> tight

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
back screws in probably a bit too tight

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.740 
back screws in probably a bit too tight
or<00:03:25.100> via<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> case<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.060> caught<00:03:26.270> because<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.600> just

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
or via the case it caught because I just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.540 
or via the case it caught because I just
took<00:03:26.959> them<00:03:27.140> out<00:03:27.260> check<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.100> button<00:03:28.220> again<00:03:28.400> and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
took them out check the button again and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.640 
took them out check the button again and
Adam<00:03:29.000> pop<00:03:29.480> back<00:03:29.630> into<00:03:29.840> place<00:03:30.050> did<00:03:30.380> them<00:03:30.470> all<00:03:30.530> up

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
Adam pop back into place did them all up

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.100 
Adam pop back into place did them all up
again<00:03:30.860> put<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.100> up<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.390> fixed

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
again put it up and that is it fixed

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.800 
again put it up and that is it fixed
that<00:03:33.950> was<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.160> relatively<00:03:34.640> easy<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.540> pain-free

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
that was a relatively easy and pain-free

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.360 
that was a relatively easy and pain-free
fix<00:03:36.520> so<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.670> need<00:03:37.820> for<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:39.370> 1000
