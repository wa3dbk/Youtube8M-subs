00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
much the volume of workers is so high

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.619 
much the volume of workers is so high
and<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:15.860> helped<00:02:16.310> care<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:17.209> know<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
might miss a very important lab or they

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.580 
might miss a very important lab or they
might<00:02:23.239> miss<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.950> know<00:02:25.099> taking<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:26.590> critical

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
medication and so there is a lot of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.259 
medication and so there is a lot of
pressure<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.670> being<00:02:32.390> accurate<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.909> so<00:02:34.909> anyway

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
pressure on being accurate and so anyway

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.210 
pressure on being accurate and so anyway

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
older I get the harder it is to take

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.720 
older I get the harder it is to take
that<00:02:39.440> kind<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.739> stress<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:41.890> I'm<00:02:42.890> doing<00:02:43.250> okay

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.379 
anyway but I'm not like on oxycodone or
anything<00:03:40.419> habit<00:03:41.419> forming<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.730> as<00:03:44.030> long<00:03:44.209> as

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
anything habit forming and so as long as

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.599 
anything habit forming and so as long as
I<00:03:44.480> don't<00:03:44.540> have<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.870> go<00:03:45.109> that<00:03:45.290> route<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:46.099> don't

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
I don't have to go that route I don't

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.390 
I don't have to go that route I don't
think<00:03:46.699> they'll<00:03:47.000> be<00:03:47.180> any<00:03:47.209> surgery<00:03:47.840> because<00:03:48.400> if

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
think they'll be any surgery because if

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.099 
think they'll be any surgery because if
I<00:03:49.579> can<00:03:49.790> live<00:03:49.940> with<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.419> that<00:03:50.629> then<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.930> much

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
I can live with it like that then I much

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.599 
I can live with it like that then I much
rather<00:03:51.260> do<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.889> have<00:03:51.980> them<00:03:52.160> cut<00:03:52.370> on<00:03:52.489> my

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
rather do that and have them cut on my

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.069 
rather do that and have them cut on my
neck<00:03:52.849> because<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.419> don't<00:03:53.599> really<00:03:53.660> want

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
neck because you don't really want

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.069 
neck because you don't really want
somebody<00:03:54.470> with<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.400> knife<00:03:55.730> aimed<00:03:56.449> at<00:03:56.840> your

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
somebody with a knife aimed at your

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.710 
somebody with a knife aimed at your
spine<00:03:57.470> unless<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.669> can<00:03:58.790> just<00:03:59.000> really<00:03:59.389> really

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
spine unless you can just really really

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.970 
spine unless you can just really really
not<00:04:00.019> help<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:01.720> some<00:04:02.720> days<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.049> think<00:04:03.500> I'm

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
not help it and some days I think I'm

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.250 
not help it and some days I think I'm
gonna<00:04:04.549> get<00:04:04.819> this<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.449> I'm<00:04:05.660> going<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.989> get<00:04:06.139> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
gonna get this you I'm going to get the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.930 
gonna get this you I'm going to get the
surgery<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.829> then<00:04:06.919> other<00:04:07.099> days<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.400> know

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
surgery and then other days you know

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.420 
surgery and then other days you know
it's<00:04:08.269> easier<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.900> take<00:04:09.079> so<00:04:09.470> thus<00:04:10.069> far<00:04:10.310> I've

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
it's easier to take so thus far I've

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.789 
it's easier to take so thus far I've
