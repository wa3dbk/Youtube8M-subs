00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
who would have thought two months ago or

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.750 
who would have thought two months ago or
I<00:00:13.650> would<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.429> doing<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:15.379> two<00:00:16.379> months<00:00:16.760> from

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I would be doing this two months from

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
I would be doing this two months from
the<00:00:17.910> last<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.449> less<00:00:18.750> than<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.140> months<00:00:19.320> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the last one less than two months it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
the last one less than two months it
slowed<00:00:20.310> down<00:00:20.550> somewhat<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.810> sort<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.170> in

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
slowed down somewhat we're sort of in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.859 
slowed down somewhat we're sort of in
somewhat<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.369> lull<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
somewhat of a lull but this is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.240 
somewhat of a lull but this is
definitely<00:00:25.820> seems<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.349> more<00:00:28.349> snow<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
definitely seems like more snow this is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.630 
definitely seems like more snow this is
the<00:00:29.400> official<00:00:29.660> steps<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.710> take<00:00:32.430> my

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the official steps with which I take my

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
the official steps with which I take my
measurements<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> try<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.110> figure

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
measurements I'm going to try and figure

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.500 
measurements I'm going to try and figure
this<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.989> take<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:38.030> but<00:00:39.030> here

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this out of it take me a little but here

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
this out of it take me a little but here
is<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> sense<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:42.120> steps<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.160> have<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> very

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
is a sense of the steps I have a very

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.330 
is a sense of the steps I have a very
funny<00:00:44.760> feeling<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.860> am<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> be

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
funny feeling that I am going to be

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.860 
funny feeling that I am going to be
putting<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
putting this in and it's just going to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.729 
putting this in and it's just going to
go<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.610> it's<00:00:50.610> completely<00:00:51.239> gone<00:00:52.850> there<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
go all it's completely gone there it is

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
go all it's completely gone there it is
there's<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.010> space<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.820> that's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
there's that space right there that's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
there's that space right there that's
the<00:00:58.199> ruler<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:59.070> 15<00:00:59.340> inches<00:01:00.030> that's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the ruler that's 15 inches that's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.520 
the ruler that's 15 inches that's
completely<00:01:00.840> gone<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.730> had<00:01:02.730> 18<00:01:03.300> last<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
completely gone I had 18 last time so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
completely gone I had 18 last time so
I'm<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.700> broom<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
I'm going to go in and get my broom and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
I'm going to go in and get my broom and

put it down in a couple of places and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.660 
put it down in a couple of places and
get<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> sense<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> exactly<00:01:09.860> how<00:01:10.860> much<00:01:11.100> snow<00:01:11.340> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
get a sense of exactly how much snow we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.750 
get a sense of exactly how much snow we
have<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.720> still<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.760> well

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760

have out here but it's still really well
it's<00:01:14.909> quite<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> tell

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
it's quite pretty as you can tell

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.780 
it's quite pretty as you can tell
still<00:01:18.470> coming<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:19.620> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.220> clip<00:01:20.550> but

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
still coming down to the good clip but

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
still coming down to the good clip but
nothing<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.570> last<00:01:21.840> night<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.320> also

very<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.130> wet<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.820> wet<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.260> is<00:01:25.350> going

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
very very wet very wet so this is going

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
very very wet very wet so this is going
to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.860> fun<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> shovel<00:01:27.200> probably<00:01:28.200> not

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to be really fun to shovel probably not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.440 
to be really fun to shovel probably not
anyway<00:01:29.130> ah<00:01:29.720> there<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.440> broom<00:01:31.830> handle

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
anyway ah there is the broom handle

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
anyway ah there is the broom handle
which<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> took<00:01:33.630> off<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
which I took off and now we're going to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.790 
which I took off and now we're going to
get<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> sense<00:01:35.460> I'm<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> probably<00:01:36.180> take

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
get a sense I'm going to probably take

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.830 
get a sense I'm going to probably take
get<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.830> sense<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.190> exactly<00:01:38.460> where<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:38.970> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
get a sense of exactly where it is this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
get a sense of exactly where it is this
is<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.260> an<00:01:40.350> estimate<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:41.010> course<00:01:41.490> but

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
is going to be an estimate of course but

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.600 
is going to be an estimate of course but
let's<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.140> my<00:01:43.320> head<00:01:43.470> comes<00:01:43.980> in<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.580> just

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
let's see how my head comes in at just

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.830 
let's see how my head comes in at just
over<00:01:45.200> 16<00:01:46.400> now<00:01:47.400> here's<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.810> remember

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
over 16 now here's the thing to remember

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.010 
over 16 now here's the thing to remember
my<00:01:49.800> highest<00:01:50.310> total<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.840> probably

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
my highest total and this is probably

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
my highest total and this is probably
silly<00:01:52.440> but<00:01:52.710> i'm<00:01:52.800> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.010> walk<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.400> way

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
silly but i'm going to walk this way

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.600 
silly but i'm going to walk this way
through<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> stuff<00:01:54.900> with<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.830> last<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.430> with

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
through the stuff with the last one with

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.660 
through the stuff with the last one with
18<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:58.200> sounds<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.580> after

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
18 it sounds like it's a little after

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.050 
18 it sounds like it's a little after
six<00:02:00.120> thirty<00:02:00.390> give<00:02:00.660> or<00:02:00.780> take<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:01.080> few<00:02:01.110> minutes<00:02:01.470> oh

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
six thirty give or take a few minutes oh

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.080 
six thirty give or take a few minutes oh
this<00:02:03.060> should<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.270> interesting<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:05.520> sounds

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
this should be interesting it sounds

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.380 
this should be interesting it sounds
like<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.570> could<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:09.440> 12<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:10.890> hours<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
like we could have 12 or more hours of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.070 
like we could have 12 or more hours of
some<00:02:13.260> amount<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.910> snow<00:02:14.910> accumulation<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.900> that

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
some amount of snow accumulation so that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.080 
some amount of snow accumulation so that
would<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.790> know<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:24.260> lot<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.290> snow<00:02:26.090> okay

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
would be you know a lot of snow okay

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.520 
would be you know a lot of snow okay
just<00:02:27.300> sort<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.600> wreck<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> back<00:02:28.050> gate<00:02:28.260> but

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
just sort of wreck the back gate but

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.400 
just sort of wreck the back gate but
that's<00:02:28.709> okay<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.209> out<00:02:30.690> towards<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that's okay so I'm going out towards the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.520 
that's okay so I'm going out towards the
street<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.580> get<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> sense<00:02:33.060> again<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.320> six

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
street to get a sense again it's six

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.670 
street to get a sense again it's six
thirtyish<00:02:34.920> 640<00:02:35.670> ish<00:02:36.020> give<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.140> take<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.350> minute

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
thirtyish 640 ish give or take a minute

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.020 
thirtyish 640 ish give or take a minute
here<00:02:37.709> are<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> have<00:02:39.510> 16<00:02:39.870> inches<00:02:41.030> we

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
here are there so I have 16 inches we

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.020 
here are there so I have 16 inches we
probably<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.510> six<00:02:42.810> solid<00:02:43.770> hours<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.700> good

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
probably have six solid hours of good

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.160 
probably have six solid hours of good
snow<00:02:45.420> left<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.530> us<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.360> do<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.660> math<00:02:48.780> even

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
snow left on us so you do the math even

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.740 
snow left on us so you do the math even
if<00:02:49.380> it's<00:02:49.530> an<00:02:49.680> inch<00:02:50.000> even<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.330> half<00:02:51.570> an

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
if it's an inch even if it's a half an

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.590 
if it's an inch even if it's a half an
inch<00:02:51.930> that's<00:02:52.920> easily<00:02:53.130> 19<00:02:53.820> that's<00:02:54.180> probably

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
inch that's easily 19 that's probably

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.560 
inch that's easily 19 that's probably
