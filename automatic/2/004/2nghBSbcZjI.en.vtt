00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
painted this you see it looks really

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.080 
painted this you see it looks really
shiny<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.960> paint<00:01:10.229> shines<00:01:10.530> off<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.939> reason

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
shiny the paint shines off the reason

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.539 
shiny the paint shines off the reason
why<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.560> used<00:01:14.070> nail

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
why that is is because I used nail

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.990 
why that is is because I used nail
polish<00:01:16.070> let<00:01:17.070> me<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> nail<00:01:17.490> polish<00:01:17.790> back

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310 
that's what I use their to paint the
green<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> used<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> lot<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> black<00:01:39.049> at<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
green here I used a lot of black at the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.010 
green here I used a lot of black at the
base<00:01:40.530> coat<00:01:40.799> first<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> black<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.840> use

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
base coat first of the black and I use

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.090 
base coat first of the black and I use
cardboard<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:43.710> sure<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.040> didn't<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
cardboard to make sure I didn't get like

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
cardboard to make sure I didn't get like
more<00:01:47.100> details<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.329> corner<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> can

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
more details there the corner you can

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.000 
more details there the corner you can
see

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.770 

so<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.280> was<00:01:52.520> very<00:01:52.550> patient<00:01:53.270> when<00:01:53.540> I<00:01:53.600> was

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
so I was very patient when I was

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.770 
so I was very patient when I was
painting<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:55.090> it's<00:01:56.090> very<00:01:56.270> light<00:01:56.570> actually

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
painting this it's very light actually

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.780 
painting this it's very light actually
very<00:01:57.620> very<00:01:57.710> light<00:01:58.300> very<00:02:00.940> big<00:02:02.980> I<00:02:03.980> think<00:02:04.700> it's

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
very very light very big I think it's

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.670 
very very light very big I think it's
more<00:02:04.850> accurate<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.600> show<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.350> Tommy

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
more accurate to the show that Tommy

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.609 
more accurate to the show that Tommy
used<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.340> not<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.790> Japanese<00:02:08.210> version<00:02:08.619> that's

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
used and not the Japanese version that's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.160 
used and not the Japanese version that's
why<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:10.070> these<00:02:10.540> right<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.600> instead<00:02:12.110> of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
why I like these right here instead of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
why I like these right here instead of
that<00:02:12.410> they<00:02:12.530> could<00:02:12.710> do<00:02:12.830> things<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.160> pop<00:02:13.370> up<00:02:13.550> is

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
that they could do things that pop up is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.600 
that they could do things that pop up is
maybe<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.330> better<00:02:14.540> grip<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.250> kind<00:02:16.520> of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
maybe a better grip on it so I kind of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.270 
maybe a better grip on it so I kind of
mixed<00:02:16.820> in<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.420> American<00:02:17.900> version<00:02:18.250> with<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
mixed in the American version with the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.800 
mixed in the American version with the
Japanese<00:02:19.820> version<00:02:19.850> with<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.390> details

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
Japanese version with the details

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.060 
Japanese version with the details
because<00:02:21.020> if<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.320> look<00:02:21.440> at<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> american

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
because if you look at the american

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.630 
because if you look at the american
version<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:23.270> isn't<00:02:23.630> as<00:02:23.750> detailed<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
version this isn't as detailed as the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.370 
version this isn't as detailed as the
other<00:02:25.790> one<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.150> i<00:02:26.330> wanted<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.660> power<00:02:26.810> corn<00:02:27.170> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
other one and i wanted the power corn to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.590 
other one and i wanted the power corn to
stick<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> little<00:02:27.980> bit<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.209> that's<00:02:29.420> why<00:02:29.540> i

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
stick out a little bit so that's why i

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.780 
stick out a little bit so that's why i
