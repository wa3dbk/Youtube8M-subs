00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.560
 aguirre arrived somewhat clueless at 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.840
 gardens and angels 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.820
 and there was the ex of the alcorcÃ³n one of 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.330
 his last rivals before leaving the 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.330
 Saragossa 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.660
 at twelve minutes to five there were only 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.550
 five minutes to return 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.240
 return to his pleasant talks with the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.240
 fourth referee 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.820
 with that line to which he says something you know 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.820
 safe 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.640
 return to that facet of motivator not 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.720
 for nothing 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.720
 and interact with the public 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.420
 and with his players 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.420
 Victor Sanchez is leading a mother 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 aguirre likes communication with 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.230
 whistles 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.320
 in English 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.320
 and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 and is that sometimes the Spanish 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 good 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.170
 Similary 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.560
 was to go back to not agree with the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.560
 referees 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.729
 to lose the reference of the technical area 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.300
 I want to suffer again for the points 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.990
 and at last he was reunited with his habitat 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 land 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 with good feelings with good 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 actions with many friends the referees 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 the people that remind me of my origin and my 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.710
 Mom but part of the game as well 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.710
 welcome again aguirre
