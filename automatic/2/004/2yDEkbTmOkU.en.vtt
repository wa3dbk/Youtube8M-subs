this<00:02:05.939> jazz<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
this jazz that

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.270 
this jazz that
and<00:02:07.060> one<00:02:07.810> will<00:02:07.930> be<00:02:08.050> but<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.160> can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and one will be but then you can

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.370 
and one will be but then you can
actually<00:02:09.399> go<00:02:09.640> into<00:02:09.820> each<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.780> choose

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
actually go into each one and choose

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.980 
actually go into each one and choose
what<00:02:11.620> body<00:02:11.890> parts<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.340> want<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:13.240> get<00:02:13.420> like<00:02:13.540> all

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
what body parts you want to get like all

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.230 
what body parts you want to get like all
of<00:02:14.470> these<00:02:14.650> which<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:15.580> cool<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.120> it's

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
of these which is so cool then it's

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.650 
of these which is so cool then it's
Cliffjumper<00:02:16.810> maybe<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.260> don't<00:02:17.380> know<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.480> then

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
Cliffjumper maybe I don't know and then

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.080 
Cliffjumper maybe I don't know and then
look<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.530> triceratops<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.910> don't

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.520 
another Dinobot I've got a creeper look
at<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.930> insectoid<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:31.420> Elite<00:02:31.720> it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
at that insectoid and then Elite it

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.380 
at that insectoid and then Elite it
looks<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.800> bumble<00:02:33.130> bee<00:02:33.220> actually<00:02:33.490> think

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
looks like bumble bee actually think

and<00:03:25.989> war<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.290> Cybertron<00:03:26.739> I'll<00:03:27.400> probably<00:03:27.640> go

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
and war for Cybertron I'll probably go

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.900 
and war for Cybertron I'll probably go
back<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.360> later<00:03:28.930> today<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.709> might<00:03:30.310> do
