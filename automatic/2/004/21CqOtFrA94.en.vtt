well that's why I have this button here
and<00:00:28.349> single<00:00:29.250> place<00:00:29.480> where<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> isn't<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and single place where it isn't all that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.620 
and single place where it isn't all that
crap<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.160> let's<00:00:32.759> hop<00:00:32.880> into<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> single-player

crap so let's hop into the single-player
world<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> medial<00:00:36.270> you'll<00:00:36.719> noticed<00:00:37.340> when

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
world and a medial you'll noticed when

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.220 
world and a medial you'll noticed when
we<00:00:38.370> face<00:00:38.670> through<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.450> sponge<00:00:39.840> because

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
we face through this is sponge because

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.000 
we face through this is sponge because
they<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.329> launches<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.570> am<00:00:43.500> sorry<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
they use it for launches I am sorry it's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
they use it for launches I am sorry it's
easily<00:00:44.309> noticeable<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.149> cold<00:00:45.510> once<00:00:45.750> again<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
easily noticeable and cold once again so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.459 
easily noticeable and cold once again so
it's<00:00:46.260> easily<00:00:46.620> noticeable<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.750> these<00:00:48.750> three

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
it's easily noticeable and these three

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.720 
it's easily noticeable and these three
are<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:50.129> changes<00:00:50.640> I've<00:00:50.820> made<00:00:51.590> these<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.980> for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
are some changes I've made these are for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
are some changes I've made these are for
connecting<00:00:54.090> textures<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.680> those

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
connecting textures as in those

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.869 
connecting textures as in those
bookcases<00:00:56.899> lowering<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.550> textures<00:00:59.550> aren't

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
bookcases lowering and textures aren't

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.110 
bookcases lowering and textures aren't
broken<00:01:00.149> percents<00:01:00.660> don't<00:01:00.870> gloss<00:01:01.399> if<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> quickly

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
broken percents don't gloss if I quickly

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.219 
broken percents don't gloss if I quickly
swap<00:01:03.420> back<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.250> default<00:01:07.430> you'll<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:09.229> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
swap back to the default you'll see that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
swap back to the default you'll see that
would<00:01:10.470> connected<00:01:10.890> textures<00:01:11.220> upon<00:01:11.630> these<00:01:12.630> are

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
would connected textures upon these are

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.580 
would connected textures upon these are
just<00:01:12.960> debug<00:01:13.530> textures<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.350> turn

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
just debug textures so if I turn

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
just debug textures so if I turn
connecting<00:01:17.220> textures<00:01:17.790> oh<00:01:18.060> fuck<00:01:18.689> remember

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
connecting textures oh fuck remember

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
connecting textures oh fuck remember
where<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:24.590> all<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.770> leg

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
to tell them off with it they're back to

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.210 
to tell them off with it they're back to
the<00:01:36.850> normal<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:38.290> glass<00:01:38.619> doesn't<00:01:38.860> look<00:01:39.070> as

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
the normal and the glass doesn't look as

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.899 
the normal and the glass doesn't look as
good<00:01:39.369> anymore<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:41.770> why<00:01:42.220> I<00:01:42.250> prefer<00:01:42.700> to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
good anymore so that's why I prefer to

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.700 
good anymore so that's why I prefer to
have<00:01:44.790> connected<00:01:45.790> textures<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.869> in<00:01:47.350> the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
myself the wither effect without going

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:56.310 
myself the wither effect without going
through<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.510> never<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:54.549> with<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> rub<00:02:56.109> done

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
through the never so with the rub done

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.190 
through the never so with the rub done
with<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.650> wither<00:02:56.829> hearts<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.430> just<00:02:58.180> change<00:02:59.019> it

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
with the wither hearts I just change it

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.780 
with the wither hearts I just change it
so<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.350> can<00:02:59.470> actually<00:02:59.620> see<00:02:59.799> how<00:03:00.250> many<00:03:00.430> hearts

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
so you can actually see how many hearts

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.460 
so you can actually see how many hearts
of<00:03:00.940> lost

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
of lost

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.290 
of lost
um<00:03:04.200> looks<00:03:05.200> like<00:03:05.650> I'll<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:07.090> into

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
um looks like I'll have to go into

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:20.420 
um looks like I'll have to go into
another<00:03:09.930> look<00:03:10.930> let's<00:03:11.800> just<00:03:11.890> do<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.460> quickly

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:37.510 

all<00:03:21.430> right

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.170
