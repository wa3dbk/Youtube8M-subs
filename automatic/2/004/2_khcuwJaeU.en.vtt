 gordon freeman fictional character 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.669
 the main character of the half-life character series 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.770
 not uttering a single word in 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.050
 one game where he appears but despite 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.750
 on this this hero is very famous and loved 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.430
 gamers around the world how he managed 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.270
 Lovers of many fans of the series 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.939
 half-life 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.040
 this question is still open 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.320
 maybe this is because of the silence and the hero 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.809
 because not talkative does not interfere 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.030
 play or is it thanks to his costume and 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.010
 such an amazing character could 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.740
 create only wolf many adore 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.050
 this hero but knows little of his life 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:53.720
 let's analyze ours in more detail 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.970
 the hero of the city he was born and raised in the village 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.800
 Washington State from an early age he 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.020
 was interested in quantum mechanics and 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.060
 theory of relativity yet force 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.699
 relatives walked outside 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.570

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.799
 works of Einstein Hawking and Weiman 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.540
 the passion of the city did not go to his advantage 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.000
 and in the late nineties he was invited 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.950
 students in Izborsk University 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.080
 thanks to an amazing mindset 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.000
 which was noticed and the sultan 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.740
 experimental physics gordon 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.549
 allowed to attend early 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.680

 scientists are looking for work outside educational 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.420
 institutions since was disappointed 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.400
 insufficient funding and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.500
 slow university development 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.470
 and here he meets with the former 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.079

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.840
 outside the miller 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.450
 there they conducted various experiments 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.260
 including teleportation experiments 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.480
 considering sources 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.610
 frame peace and financing suspected 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.420
 that the center is developing new 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.849
 armament 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.040
 but despite the fears the scientist hoped 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.260
 that the world is on the application of technology also 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.090
 will be found freeman got the position

 provided apartment in a hostel 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.739
 research center before 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.720
 the hero took up his duties he 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.700
 took a training course on research 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.189
 special protective suit hail

 weapons and even direct hit sir pgs 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.799
 the costume was originally designed for 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.810
 military but due to the high cost of 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.459
 development decided what to use it 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.859
 there will be only scientific staff 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.900
 working in black meze and gordon gets 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.449
 friends who will not leave him in difficult 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.660
 minute this is guard barney kolhaun 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.609
 and researcher Eli Vance Freeman and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.129
 his buddy guard thief didn't like 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.870
 fool around and very often competed 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.329
 who quickly gets inside the office 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.220
 dispersed professor after 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.739
 he was losing the keys to the door to his office 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.230
 at this time labs were held 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.079
 teleportation experiments and scientists 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.419
 found a way to get Mersin there something they 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.669
 found mysterious crystals again 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.099
 perfect clean and proper 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:20.130
 crystal they could not find 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.079
 but that day has come, and all scientists 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.300
 same delivered clean and correct 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.120
 crystal to analyze 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.570
 laboratories send young gordon 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.639
 freeman 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.650
 who are unaware that typical 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.020
 the experiment will affect the lives of many 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.060
 as a result of the failure of the experiment in 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.750
 black mesa hordes are being teleported 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.169
 alien 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.150
 hartigan of from a parallel world and 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.130
 destroys all living things here and begins 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.469
 incredible attraction of young 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.210
 a scientist 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.669
 waltz wanted to create a character on either 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.250
 so who does not look like a prototype face 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.500
 served no one but ten at once 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.050
 Originally Gordon was known as Ivan 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.120
 cosmo biker with a big beard which 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.880
 was later circumcised in spain alku 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.789
 the character made thinner she his 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.950
 face dressed glasses administration letter 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.570
 it is noted that freeme is not 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.849
 married and has no children 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.219
 However, if at the beginning of the game go to 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.130
 scientists locker room and peek locker with 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:19.650
 the surnames of freeman then it will show up 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.630
 picture of a little baby thing 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.479
 I wonder what in the second part of the game 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.370
 This hero did not have his own model 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.159
 the game even exists associated with this 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.620
 Easter egg decided to name the character in 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.570
 honor of the famous physicist theorist 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.810
 Freeman Dyson developers have endowed 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.880
 hero interesting chip in our case 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.050
 mount which became the most 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.400
 recognizable weapon in the gaming industry 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.159
 Gordon Freeman immediately became an object 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.099
 many easter eggs in other games for example 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:53.279
 in the game ji hey san andreas inside 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.919
 secret military base of zone 69 in the desert 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.650
 you can find lying pry on the table 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.390
 in one of the labs in the stalker game 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.670
 shadow of chernobyl quest find family 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.550
 hunter's guns near the gun 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.580
 lying around the corpse stalker novice his name 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.830
 free we in the photo he is wearing glasses in 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.000
 description indicated a scientific expert on 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.160
 abnormal phenomena 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.650
 worked in america on a secret project 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.290
 recently he was considered missing 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.040
 without a gun wears a desert gun 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.290
 eagle 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.390
 at the same time there is a journal entry in 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.640
 found the trap of Gordon Freeman where 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.470
 is part of his diary which 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.660
 it is said that he is not allowed to rest 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.270
 first black mesa then some 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.910
 strange city in Russia and then go 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.850
 on the boundless steppes of Ukraine that is 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.220
 Chernobyl in the process of studying the PDA we 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.850
 find out that Gordon Freeman traded his 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.800
 red crowbar on the jar of stew 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.190
 Gordon Freeman immediately after the game 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.080
 gamespot readers ranked it in 50 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.020
 the best hero of computer games 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.270
 and in 2011 received eighth place in 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.210
 list of the top 50 computer characters 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.070
 games according to the Guinness Book of Records 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.830
 Gordon Freeman became one of the most 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.470
 recognizable we are so loved by players 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.660
 character and what do you like or not 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.950
 love this character about all this 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.100
 write in the comments 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.530
 and you had a hedgehog if you liked 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.530
 similar material in the dart mount 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.060
 I like the button so I will understand 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.960
 Do I remember other gaming 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.210
 characters 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.710
 I wish you all successful experiments with 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.710
 teleportation bye
