00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.520 
this is usually what I do with my silk
base<00:03:46.640> closures<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.540> now<00:03:48.049> I'm<00:03:48.170> just<00:03:48.230> going<00:03:48.500> to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.860 
take the closure and hold the hair all
back<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.459> don't<00:03:52.609> want<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> get<00:03:53.000> too<00:03:53.480> much<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.690> the

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
back I don't want to get too much of the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.870 
back I don't want to get too much of the
hair<00:03:54.079> into<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> dye<00:03:54.709> although<00:03:55.609> it<00:03:55.700> doesn't

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
hair into the dye although it doesn't

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.210 
hair into the dye although it doesn't
really<00:03:56.049> tinted<00:03:57.049> that<00:03:57.170> much<00:03:57.380> because<00:03:57.829> it<00:03:58.070> just

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
really tinted that much because it just

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.930 
really tinted that much because it just
I<00:03:58.400> guess<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:58.760> just<00:03:58.790> doesn't<00:03:59.359> and<00:04:00.519> now<00:04:01.519> I'm<00:04:01.760> just
