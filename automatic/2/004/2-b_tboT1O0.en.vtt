numbers<00:02:08.210> I<00:02:08.330> thought<00:02:08.510> all<00:02:08.630> right<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:08.899> guy<00:02:09.050> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
numbers I thought all right this guy is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.870 
numbers I thought all right this guy is
going<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.380> get<00:02:09.470> drafted<00:02:09.740> early<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.310> he<00:02:10.369> was<00:02:10.550> he

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
going to get drafted early and he was he

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.550 
going to get drafted early and he was he
was<00:02:11.000> drafted<00:02:11.240> by<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.570> Tennessee<00:02:11.990> Titans<00:02:12.020> in

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
kind of take a look at this footage and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.920 
kind of take a look at this footage and
listen<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.740> how<00:02:19.580> we<00:02:19.640> break<00:02:20.030> down<00:02:20.060> athletes

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
listen to how we break down athletes

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.620 
listen to how we break down athletes
running<00:02:21.260> form<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.770> I'll<00:02:22.640> talk<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.330> when

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
running form and I'll talk to you when

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.430 
running form and I'll talk to you when
we<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.260> done<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.630> first<00:02:26.870> thing<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.200> have<00:02:27.260> to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
we get done the first thing you have to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.870 
we get done the first thing you have to
observe<00:02:27.830> when<00:02:28.130> you're<00:02:28.280> watching<00:02:28.460> Chris

observe when you're watching Chris
Johnson<00:02:29.660> run<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.170> look<00:02:30.350> at<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.620> stride

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
Johnson run is look at that stride

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.090 
Johnson run is look at that stride
length<00:02:31.330> he's<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:32.720> guy's<00:02:32.900> only<00:02:33.050> 5<00:02:33.410> 11<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:33.950> he

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
length he's this guy's only 5 11 and he

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
the balls of his feet so what I'm going

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.520 
the balls of his feet so what I'm going
to<00:03:01.130> do<00:03:01.280> now<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.820> I'm<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.209> show<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.140> one

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
to do now is I'm going to show you one

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.040 
to do now is I'm going to show you one
of<00:03:03.560> our<00:03:03.769> typical<00:03:04.070> athletes<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.930> can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
of our typical athletes so that you can

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.290 
of our typical athletes so that you can
kind<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.320> compare<00:03:06.500> Chris<00:03:07.489> Johnson's<00:03:08.030> form

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
kind of compare Chris Johnson's form

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.410 
kind of compare Chris Johnson's form
with<00:03:08.570> this<00:03:08.720> athletes<00:03:09.230> form<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.769> then<00:03:10.400> see<00:03:11.300> how

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
with this athletes form and then see how

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.040 
with this athletes form and then see how
we<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.780> help<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.170> athlete<00:03:13.630> all<00:03:14.630> right<00:03:14.780> this

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
we can help that athlete all right this

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.860 
we can help that athlete all right this

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
Johnson's is also hit he his leg

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.060 
Johnson's is also hit he his leg

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
have a quick turnover his hamstrings

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.449 
have a quick turnover his hamstrings
aren't<00:03:28.220> firing<00:03:28.459> well<00:03:29.080> because<00:03:30.080> he's<00:03:30.980> just<00:03:31.280> not

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
aren't firing well because he's just not

aren't firing well because he's just not
generating<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> power<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:32.600> he<00:03:32.630> need<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.140> build

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
generating the power so he need to build

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.680 
generating the power so he need to build
up<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> strength<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:34.220> his<00:03:34.400> legs<00:03:34.760> that'll<00:03:35.570> help

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
up the strength in his legs that'll help

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.509 
up the strength in his legs that'll help
correct<00:03:36.019> his<00:03:36.260> stride<00:03:36.530> length<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.070> his<00:03:37.280> turn

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
correct his stride length and his turn

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.030 
correct his stride length and his turn
over<00:03:37.880> his<00:03:38.660> arms<00:03:39.110> aren't<00:03:39.290> bad<00:03:39.560> they're<00:03:39.920> in

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
over his arms aren't bad they're in

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.220 
over his arms aren't bad they're in
decent<00:03:40.489> L<00:03:40.580> shapes<00:03:40.940> his<00:03:41.420> core<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:41.930> pretty

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
decent L shapes his core is pretty

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.009 
decent L shapes his core is pretty
strong<00:03:42.880> but<00:03:43.880> if<00:03:44.000> we<00:03:44.150> could<00:03:44.269> get<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.690> power

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
strong but if we could get that power

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.040 
strong but if we could get that power
his<00:03:45.290> legs<00:03:45.530> generated<00:03:46.330> he<00:03:47.330> might<00:03:47.570> not<00:03:47.600> be<00:03:47.780> as

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
his legs generated he might not be as

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.080 
his legs generated he might not be as
fast<00:03:48.320> as<00:03:48.560> Chris<00:03:48.769> Johnson<00:03:49.250> he'll<00:03:49.459> be<00:03:49.579> faster

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
fast as Chris Johnson he'll be faster

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.910 
fast as Chris Johnson he'll be faster
and<00:03:50.600> his<00:03:50.750> formal<00:03:51.200> look<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.440> heck<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.829> lot

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
and his formal look a heck of a lot

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.550 
and his formal look a heck of a lot
better

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.970 

so<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.160> hope<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.520> found<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.849> interesting

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
so I hope you found that interesting
