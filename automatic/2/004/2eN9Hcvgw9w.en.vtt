to look at a projector first projectors

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
to look at a projector first projectors
can<00:01:02.039> create<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> largest<00:01:02.730> image<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.510> home

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
can create the largest image in home

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
can create the largest image in home
theater<00:01:04.049> setups<00:01:04.430> currently<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.820> largest

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
theater setups currently the largest

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730

flat<00:01:06.390> panel<00:01:06.659> television<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> market<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
flat panel television on the market is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
flat panel television on the market is
90<00:01:08.130> inches<00:01:08.430> while<00:01:08.880> projectors<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.900> produce

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
90 inches while projectors can produce

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.780 
90 inches while projectors can produce
images<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.850> 300<00:01:11.850> inches<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.720> 25<00:01:13.170> feet

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
images up to 300 inches that's 25 feet

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
images up to 300 inches that's 25 feet
so<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> room<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.659> size<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so if you're in a room this size a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.340 
so if you're in a room this size a
projector<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> probably<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.820> best<00:01:17.970> bet

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
projector is probably your best bet

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.300 
projector is probably your best bet
projectors<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.650> flexible<00:01:19.860> home

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
projectors are more flexible home

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
projectors are more flexible home

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.359 
windows then you may want a flat panel
television<00:01:33.000> instead<00:01:33.299> however<00:01:34.170> plasma<00:01:35.040> TVs

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
television instead however plasma TVs

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
television instead however plasma TVs
aren't<00:01:35.700> ideal<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.240> natural<00:01:36.570> light<00:01:36.689> rooms<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
aren't ideal in natural light rooms so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.179 
aren't ideal in natural light rooms so

opera LED or LCD TV instead projectors
work<00:01:41.340> great<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.670> night<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> under<00:01:42.600> low<00:01:42.750> light

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
work great at night and under low light

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.810 
work great at night and under low light
conditions<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.890> poorly<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.399> rooms<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
conditions but poorly in rooms with a

lot of ambient light in most cases with

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.039 
lot of ambient light in most cases with
projectors<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.630> achieve<00:01:48.899> better

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
projectors you can achieve better

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
projectors you can achieve better
results<00:01:49.170> by<00:01:49.649> cutting<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> ambient<00:01:50.790> light

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
results by cutting out the ambient light

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.090 
results by cutting out the ambient light
then<00:01:51.600> by<00:01:51.750> buying<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.290> expensive<00:01:52.590> model

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
then by buying a more expensive model
