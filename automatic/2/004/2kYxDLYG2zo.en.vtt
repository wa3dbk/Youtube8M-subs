00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.080 

I<00:00:18.140> think<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.260> life<00:00:19.470> changed<00:00:20.130> overnight<00:00:20.340> you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I think my life changed overnight you

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.740 
I think my life changed overnight you
know<00:00:21.180> when<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.869> Anita<00:00:22.140> released<00:00:25.640> suddenly

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.650 

you're<00:00:30.750> faced<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:32.300> people<00:00:33.300> who<00:00:33.450> know<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you're faced with people who know you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
you're faced with people who know you
everywhere<00:00:35.899> that's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.140> great<00:00:37.469> feeling<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
everywhere that's a great feeling in a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.549 
everywhere that's a great feeling in a
certain<00:00:38.610> sense<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.239> yet<00:00:39.450> there's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> certain

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
certain sense and yet there's a certain

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.470 
certain sense and yet there's a certain
sense<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.480> invasion<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.719> our<00:00:42.930> loss<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.129> privacy

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
sense of invasion of our loss of privacy

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.290 
sense of invasion of our loss of privacy
for<00:00:45.480> someone<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.079> private<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.620> me<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
for someone as private as me I think it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.340 
for someone as private as me I think it
it<00:00:48.660> came<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> shock<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:51.050> much<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it came as a bit of a shock as much as I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
it came as a bit of a shock as much as I
was<00:00:52.500> hungry<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.370> stardom<00:00:54.030> than<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
was hungry for that stardom than the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.500 
was hungry for that stardom than the
success<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.440> film<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.949> be<00:00:55.980> appreciated<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
success and my film to be appreciated it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.930 
success and my film to be appreciated it
did<00:00:57.809> take<00:00:57.989> me<00:00:58.050> by<00:00:58.230> surprise<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
did take me by surprise but I think I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.640 
did take me by surprise but I think I
also<00:01:00.410> slipped<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.430> seamlessly

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
also slipped into it quite seamlessly

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.750 
also slipped into it quite seamlessly
whatever<00:01:04.650> struggles<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.489> faced<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.210> sense

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
whatever struggles I faced in that sense

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.660 
whatever struggles I faced in that sense
only<00:01:08.760> happened<00:01:09.619> within<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.860> confines<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.280> my

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
only happened within the confines of my

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
only happened within the confines of my
own<00:01:11.700> room<00:01:12.479> within<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.960> confines<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.830> head

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
own room within the confines of my head

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.570 
own room within the confines of my head
or<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.630> family<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.740> thing<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
or with my family one thing that you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
or with my family one thing that you
know<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.740> us<00:01:20.270> deal<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
know I think all of us deal with and I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
know I think all of us deal with and I
can<00:01:22.740> definitely<00:01:23.180> say<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.630> been<00:01:24.869> quite

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
can definitely say that it's been quite

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.350 
can definitely say that it's been quite
a<00:01:25.110> challenge<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> inability<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
a challenge for me is the inability to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.569 
a challenge for me is the inability to
accept<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.590> being<00:01:31.860> watched<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
accept that you're being watched and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.719 
accept that you're being watched and
judged<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> evaluated<00:01:34.320> every<00:01:34.500> moment<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
judged and evaluated every moment I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.770 
judged and evaluated every moment I
think<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.689> takes<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.770> toll<00:01:38.780> initially

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
think that really takes a toll initially

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.899 
think that really takes a toll initially
I<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:40.110> oblivious<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.850> was

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I was oblivious to it and then there was

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
I was oblivious to it and then there was
a<00:01:41.970> time<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.659> was<00:01:43.729> very<00:01:44.729> sharply<00:01:45.740> conscious

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
a time when I was very sharply conscious

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
a time when I was very sharply conscious
of<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.119> I've<00:01:48.270> reached<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.689> stage

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
of it and then now I've reached a stage

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
of it and then now I've reached a stage
where<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.590> largely<00:01:50.189> about<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.850> take

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
where I'm just largely about it I take

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
where I'm just largely about it I take
it<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.270> my<00:01:51.299> stride<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:52.290> yes<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.700> am

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
it in my stride but yes I think I am

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
it in my stride but yes I think I am
aware<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> has

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
aware of it and I do think that that has

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.920 
aware of it and I do think that that has
been<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> greatest<00:01:56.939> challenges<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
been one of the greatest challenges to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.850 
been one of the greatest challenges to
be

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
be

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.859 
be
due<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.340> be<00:02:01.490> aware<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.210> fact<00:02:02.510> that<00:02:02.659> you're

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
due to be aware of the fact that you're

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.170 
due to be aware of the fact that you're
constantly<00:02:03.500> being<00:02:03.860> watched<00:02:04.190> that's<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.060> tough

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
constantly being watched that's a tough

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.450 
constantly being watched that's a tough
one
