00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 hey people and welcome to a new one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.330
 video thanks for turning my name 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.490
 is human date and today I show you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.580
 my favorite equipment for the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.289
 enlighten my enlightener setup is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 actually not that much for 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 Enlightening, at least, actually 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.380
 more shot than enlightened I will 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 The most close to the action 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 to help out there that means now 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.619
 not that I'm really a so called 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 I am aggressive but I am already 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 rather the action than me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 sitting somewhere on a mountain and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.989
 somehow sniper around the nice balance 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 to get between close and long-distance combat 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 I use myself as the primary weapon of the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.180
 gol magnum on top of it is that 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.469
 jg m4 or the cl 6x visor first name 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 I still like to run it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.149
 muzzle fire damper on it laser visor 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 and straight train are of course 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.520
 also my secondary weapon is the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.160
 always reliable compact 45 with mini 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.170
 red dot visor green laser visor and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.549
 the muzzle fire damper because the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 both weapons are not enough 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.590
 we also have the motion detector 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 in the form of the cup and because that's it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 we have not enough now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 again as a second gadget something 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 explosives so you have something 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 against vehicles in hand around the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.470
 equipment now complete 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.439
 I still have the defensive squad 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
 Burgundy defrag grenades while the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.619
 equipment as it is now 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.060
 I really enjoy playing this 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.310
 really a nice mix between 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.250
 near and farfare and infantry and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.000
 vehicle combat possibilities 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.920
 but you can still do that at the same time 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.259
 help his team and that while 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.640
 enlighten by giving these 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.869
 Motion sensors throw you have to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.759
 just remember that the things only 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.229
 Stay alive for 20 seconds and afterwards 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.420
 you need a new one that means you 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.829
 should always look for one 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 keep supporters open 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.729
 the golden magnum is here so the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.590
 Primary weapon in this equipment and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.570
 so I'll go there a little, he 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.610
 on it and that I find these 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.100
 Just weapon on something 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.880
 greater distance is the weapon 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.350
 to master reliably 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.090
 because the projectile fast enough 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.129
 are on the way and that is also the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.220
 Reason why I am not for the m40 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.750
 a5 decided the m45 has namely 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.470
 otherwise the advantage that you not only 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 six but 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 l would have pulled coburg but would have 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.770
 Finally, I think the gold than 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.180
 allrounder through the higher project the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.520
 speed just better and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.110
 more reliable and completely honest me 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.700
 do not need a weapon only from time to time 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 times is reliable but actually 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.450
 always and that is exactly the reason 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.130
 why I have taken the gol 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.110
 I also have a lot of the m40 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.090
 played but it was already 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.770
 very very tricky on longer 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.780
 distances what to hit just when 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 the opponent then times moved boy 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.860
 job is a thing, but you can 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.690
 because not too much if then the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.130
 ball still so slowly in the air 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 homeyer so that the opponent sees 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.910
 literally sees himself approaching and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.380
 then it can react a bit 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.120
 in the matrix and bullet time 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.560
 that's a bit too 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.330
 harder to explain what then my 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.310
 place part with such a weapon is so 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.380
 he is definitely not the addressee 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.300
 that means I'm not always in 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.220
 primarily though I'm more so in 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.840
 second or third but definitely 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.120
 not in the last one where the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 real sharp-shooter otherwise he lies 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.720
 with his 40 times visor on the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.370
 Operation firestorm berg is located at 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.230
 example, that's not my thing 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.670
 and that's why I think the golden one 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.160
 come just as well because they are so beautiful 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.510
 both that means near and far fight 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.459
 can connect with each other 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.500
 that means she is on small distances 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.180
 to use somehow because they are fast 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.700
 enough shoots and also these six shows 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.560
 Mostly enough and moreover 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
 longer distances then by their high 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.720
 convincing projectile speed 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.400
 can 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.050
 but now I have enough of that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.430
 rave weapon here and now it works 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.220
 first on to the next and that 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.680
 the secondary weapon and indeed the compact 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.480
 45 why I have them with me 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.489
 also already more detailed in one 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.900
 a video explained and that s.dem the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.549
 best guns video 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.019
 I have the weapon there as one 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.940
 the best and I play 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.370
 She really enjoys it until today 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.470
 and she is actually still only 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.000
 continue in the toplist of my weapons 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.260
 because I just got it 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.480
 actually always has it 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.400
 By the way, the beautiful on the po sources 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 is just when you're more aggressive 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.480
 plays that you almost did not notice 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.299
 you hear it as an opponent that there 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.130
 there is something or something , however 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.140
 you have to ding indeed first find 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.600
 to be able to do something with that and that 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.669
 is just so small and inconspicuous that 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.470
 you can hide that very nicely 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.510
 but I just realized it 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.020
 if I do not have such a good day 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.449
 Has 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.099
 What do you think of him then went 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.289
 I already had very bad cards 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.150
 with it and had to be so defensive 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.650
 that means even if I'm close to 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.419
 The action does not have to be 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.680
 be in the action and me 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.930
 think you have to be here a bit 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.370
 say more clearly then as said that 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.960
 just does not make me one 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.639
 more aggressive know the crossover 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.319
 crocheted would just walk in and 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.240
 to do all the people in the room 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.099
 Unfortunately, my opponents are never so stupid and 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.449
 Besides, I'm not that good at that 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.300
 so we can do that better 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.300
 and stay in such a mixture between 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.159
 offensive and aggressive sniper 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.560
 less aggressive but definitely 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.240
 defensively, we now go ahead of us 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.380
 are now at the end of the video 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.940
 Thanks for watching and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.889
 maybe I wanted to go back to the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.780
 Write comments as you thus the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.940
 Sniper play that does not mean only with the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.530
 equipment looks like that but also 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.060
 how you are doing and what yours 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.440
 secrets I myself have like 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.940
 said I kinda like that 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.770
 a mix between aggressive and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.569
 defensive sniper 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.280
 Of course, not everyone is 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.740
 writes new items, so what do you do and 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.240
 as you it makes otherwise I know but 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.340
 short on my the trailing in the 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.860
 description knows there you can play games 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.229
 Buy and the cheap so then 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.620
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.620
 next time
