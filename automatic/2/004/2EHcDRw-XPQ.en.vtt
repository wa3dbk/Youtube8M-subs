ovens that you can cook things in this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
ovens that you can cook things in this
is<00:01:53.549> supposed<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.880> an<00:01:53.970> oven<00:01:54.210> overhead<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.930> I

is supposed to be an oven overhead so I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.660 
is supposed to be an oven overhead so I
guess<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.560> cool<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.490> these

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
guess that kind of cool and these

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.670 
guess that kind of cool and these
couches<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> actually<00:01:57.479> tile<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
couches you can actually tile so you can

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.260 
couches you can actually tile so you can
make<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.829> K<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.280> super<00:01:59.820> long<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
make the K which like super long and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.050 
make the K which like super long and
shift<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.409> there's<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> have

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060

see<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.330> go<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:30.959> going<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
see it's going to go and it's going to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
see it's going to go and it's going to
eventually<00:02:31.680> create<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.190> block<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.549> ice<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.910> wish

eventually create a block of ice I wish

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.690 
eventually create a block of ice I wish
it<00:02:33.480> would<00:02:33.569> create<00:02:33.780> more<00:02:34.019> than<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
it would create more than one because it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.690 
it would create more than one because it
does<00:02:35.849> take<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.269> know<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> block<00:02:37.349> two<00:02:38.040> buckets

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
does take you know to block two buckets

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.640 
does take you know to block two buckets
or<00:02:39.450> two<00:02:39.629> buckets<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> water<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.290> see<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> one

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
or two buckets of water to see a one

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.500 
or two buckets of water to see a one
block<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:41.010> ice<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> wish<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.209> was<00:02:42.329> kind<00:02:42.480> of

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
block of ice so I wish that was kind of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.460 
block of ice so I wish that was kind of
different<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.049> do<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.440> can

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510

definitely<00:03:23.099> do<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:23.880> finally

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
definitely do like this and then finally

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.339

we<00:03:24.299> have<00:03:24.389> carpets<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.139> new<00:03:25.319> thing

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
we have carpets so this is a new thing

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.740 
we have carpets so this is a new thing
in<00:03:25.620> Minecraft<00:03:25.769> 1.5<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.239> actor<00:03:27.510> my

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
in Minecraft 1.5 but this is actor my

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.080 
in Minecraft 1.5 but this is actor my
minecraft<00:03:28.349> 1.6<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.549> interestingly

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
minecraft 1.6 but this interestingly

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.539 
minecraft 1.6 but this interestingly
enough<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.660> actually<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.349> like<00:03:32.010> flush<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
enough is actually like like flush to

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.460 
enough is actually like like flush to
the<00:03:32.579> floor<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.090> i<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.299> actually<00:03:33.599> break<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.290> oh

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
the floor so i can actually break it oh

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.559 
the floor so i can actually break it oh
there<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.819> i<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.000> actually<00:03:36.209> break<00:03:36.359> it

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
there we go so i can actually break it

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.120 
there we go so i can actually break it
but<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.049> actually<00:03:37.139> flush<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.769> floor<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
but it's actually flush to the floor so

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.680 
but it's actually flush to the floor so
it<00:03:38.160> actually<00:03:38.340> changes<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.150> texture<00:03:39.480> that's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
it actually changes the texture that's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.640 
it actually changes the texture that's
why<00:03:39.810> there's<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.049> little<00:03:40.169> bit<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.620> know

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
why there's a little bit of you know

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.770 
why there's a little bit of you know
clipping<00:03:41.130> here<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.329> changes<00:03:42.630> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
clipping here but actually changes the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.240 
clipping here but actually changes the
texture<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.319> floor<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:43.859> not<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.130> it

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
texture of the floor so it's not like it

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.120 
texture of the floor so it's not like it
lies<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.459> top<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:46.109> anyway<00:03:46.410> that's<00:03:46.769> kind

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
lies on top of it so anyway that's kind

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.740 
lies on top of it so anyway that's kind
of<00:03:47.250> those<00:03:47.639> items<00:03:47.940> i'm<00:03:48.299> just<00:03:48.450> gonna<00:03:48.540> show<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
of those items i'm just gonna show you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.420 
of those items i'm just gonna show you
guys<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> crafting<00:03:49.260> recipes<00:03:49.590> quickly<00:03:50.010> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
guys the crafting recipes quickly so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.800 
guys the crafting recipes quickly so
something<00:03:50.790> like<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.000> bedside<00:03:51.299> cabinet<00:03:51.690> is

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
something like the bedside cabinet is

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.990 
something like the bedside cabinet is
actually<00:03:52.109> pretty<00:03:52.349> difficult<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:53.609> create<00:03:53.819> when

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
actually pretty difficult to create when

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.979 
actually pretty difficult to create when
you<00:03:54.060> think<00:03:54.239> about<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.840> does

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
you think about it because it does

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.569 
you think about it because it does
require<00:03:55.200> two<00:03:55.560> chests<00:03:55.829> but<00:03:56.129> that<00:03:56.340> being<00:03:56.519> said

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
require two chests but that being said

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.750 
require two chests but that being said
it<00:03:56.819> does<00:03:56.849> hold<00:03:57.359> two<00:03:57.660> chests<00:03:58.139> in<00:03:58.530> one<00:03:58.889> block<00:03:59.310> but

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
it does hold two chests in one block but

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.280 
it does hold two chests in one block but
as<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.030> guys<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.299> see<00:04:00.359> with<00:04:00.660> two<00:04:00.810> chests<00:04:01.109> it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
as you guys can see with two chests it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.740 
as you guys can see with two chests it
is<00:04:01.379> kind<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.889> know<00:04:01.919> more<00:04:02.750> resource

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
is kind of you know more resource

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.050 
is kind of you know more resource
consuming<00:04:04.109> but<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.250> just<00:04:05.489> wood<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.000> you

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
consuming but it is just wood so you

getting stoned and having to do that

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.010 
getting stoned and having to do that
then<00:06:07.770> you<00:06:08.130> have<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:09.210> white<00:06:09.419> fence<00:06:09.690> which<00:06:09.870> is

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
then you have the white fence which is

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.350 
then you have the white fence which is
just<00:06:10.440> simply<00:06:10.650> died<00:06:11.010> normal<00:06:11.940> fence<00:06:12.150> so<00:06:12.270> you

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360
