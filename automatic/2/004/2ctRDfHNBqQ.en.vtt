phantom<00:00:03.750> special<00:00:04.500> six<00:00:05.180> I'm<00:00:06.180> selling<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.779> eBay

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
phantom special six I'm selling on eBay

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.320 
phantom special six I'm selling on eBay
it's<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.950> one<00:00:08.099> with<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> effects<00:00:08.730> built<00:00:08.970> into

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
it's the one with the effects built into

00:00:09.330 --> 00:01:18.260 
it's the one with the effects built into
it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:02:06.209 

the<00:02:01.560> fastest<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.219> that<00:02:04.179> is<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.599> repeat<00:02:05.590> speed

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
the fastest and that is the repeat speed

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.389 
the fastest and that is the repeat speed
and<00:02:06.539> also<00:02:07.649> auto-tune<00:02:08.649> which<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.069> basically

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
and also auto-tune which is basically

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.280 
and also auto-tune which is basically
gives<00:02:09.609> you<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> tone<00:02:10.060> which<00:02:10.390> isn't<00:02:11.109> very

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
gives you a tone which isn't very

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.000 
gives you a tone which isn't very
accurate<00:02:11.440> listen

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.020 

that's<00:02:15.909> for<00:02:16.060> tuning<00:02:16.390> -<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.430> there's<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.519> volume

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
that's for tuning - and there's a volume

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.890 
that's for tuning - and there's a volume
control<00:02:19.900> here<00:02:20.310> she's<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.549> bit<00:02:21.760> crusty

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.320 

and<00:02:25.900> also<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.709> switches<00:02:27.430> off<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.700> electrics

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
and also that switches off the electrics

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.660 
and also that switches off the electrics
which<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.989> doesn't<00:02:29.200> actually<00:02:29.470> do<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.250> guitar

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
which it doesn't actually do this guitar

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.699 
which it doesn't actually do this guitar
so<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.360> leave<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.629> battery<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> will

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
so if you leave the battery in it will

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:41.610 
so if you leave the battery in it will
drain<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:39.150> don't<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.629> tremolo<00:02:41.079> arm<00:02:41.290> or

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
drain it I don't have a tremolo arm or

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.300 
drain it I don't have a tremolo arm or
the<00:02:41.829> spring<00:02:42.160> for<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.560> I've<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:44.890> got

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the spring for it and so I've just got

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.030 
the spring for it and so I've just got
the<00:02:46.150> screw<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.840> there<00:02:47.049> just<00:02:47.230> holding<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.769> in

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the screw in there just holding that in

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.770 
the screw in there just holding that in
one<00:02:48.280> position<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:51.299> not<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.420> original

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
one position and not the original

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.580 
one position and not the original
machine<00:02:53.049> heads

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
machine heads

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.309 
machine heads

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
refinished in natural and the back

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.789

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
and see this blemish here that's just I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.039 
and see this blemish here that's just I
think<00:03:15.819> it's<00:03:16.030> just<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.239> mark<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.690> wood<00:03:16.840> it's

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
think it's just a mark in the wood it's

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:39.509 
think it's just a mark in the wood it's
didn't<00:03:17.290> seem<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:28.799> crackly<00:03:38.519> psychedelic

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
didn't seem to be a crackly psychedelic

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.880 
didn't seem to be a crackly psychedelic
