00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
scene after the climax is a very good

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
scene after the climax is a very good
payoff<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> didn't<00:01:45.420> find<00:01:45.630> yourself<00:01:45.960> very

allowed<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.640> drag<00:01:51.060> sort<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> same<00:01:51.810> way

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
allowed to drag sort of in the same way

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.140 
later I just wish it was a little
harder<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.860> don't<00:01:58.250> know<00:01:58.340> maybe<00:01:58.580> it's<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.880> sick

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
bastard in me but I think this could

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
have been a little bit more adult but as

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.620 
have been a little bit more adult but as
is<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.130> decent<00:02:04.520> movie<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.210> songs<00:02:05.420> aren't

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
is it's a decent movie the songs aren't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
is it's a decent movie the songs aren't
really<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.990> memorable<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.590> don't

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
really that memorable and I don't

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.469 
really that memorable and I don't
remember<00:02:07.010> too<00:02:07.340> many<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.730> side<00:02:08.000> characters

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.120 
remember too many of the side characters
either<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.649> friendship<00:02:10.040> between

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
either but it's the friendship between

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.460 
either but it's the friendship between
the<00:02:10.460> two<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.700> them<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:10.970> really<00:02:11.450> holds<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.870> I'd

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
the two of them that really holds up I'd

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.600
