00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
okay so today we're going to be having a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.190 
okay so today we're going to be having a
look<00:00:10.530> at<00:00:10.769> Microsoft's<00:00:11.700> wireless<00:00:12.200> xbox360

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
look at Microsoft's wireless xbox360

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.390 
look at Microsoft's wireless xbox360
controller<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.400> PC<00:00:15.980> now<00:00:16.980> as<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.340> see

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
controller for the PC now as you can see

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.570 
controller for the PC now as you can see
here<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.660> basically<00:00:19.320> designed<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
here this is basically designed like I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
here this is basically designed like I
said<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> PC<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.769> only<00:00:22.769> real<00:00:22.920> difference

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
said for the PC the only real difference

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.300 
said for the PC the only real difference
between<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.060> your<00:00:24.390> standard<00:00:24.840> Xbox<00:00:25.310> you

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
between this and your standard Xbox you

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.279 
between this and your standard Xbox you
know<00:00:26.400> controller<00:00:26.820> pack<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> has<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
know controller pack is that it has the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.279 
know controller pack is that it has the
receiver<00:00:28.939> which<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:30.359> receive<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> Xbox

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
receiver which will receive the Xbox

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.770 
receiver which will receive the Xbox
360s<00:00:31.980> infrared<00:00:32.550> signal<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> believe<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> uses

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
360s infrared signal I believe it uses

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.430 
360s infrared signal I believe it uses
yeah<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> ps4<00:00:35.070> uses<00:00:35.280> bluetooth<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.540> yeah

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
yeah the ps4 uses bluetooth and yeah

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
yeah the ps4 uses bluetooth and yeah
so<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.520> basically<00:00:38.910> comes<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.390> an<00:00:39.480> all-in-one

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so this basically comes in an all-in-one

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
so this basically comes in an all-in-one
pack<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.890> guess<00:00:41.790> they're<00:00:42.000> assuming<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
pack I guess they're assuming that you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.680 
pack I guess they're assuming that you
don't<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> Xbox<00:00:43.879> controller<00:00:44.969> hence<00:00:45.539> way

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
don't have a Xbox controller hence way

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.930 
don't have a Xbox controller hence way
buying<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.140> pack<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.620> um<00:00:46.829> yeah<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.910> guess

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
buying this pack but um yeah I guess

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
buying this pack but um yeah I guess
it's<00:00:48.239> pretty<00:00:48.360> cool<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.660> throw<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.079> I'll<00:00:49.289> go

the boat together which is a really
handy<00:01:32.490> feature<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:34.350> here<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:37.400> there

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
handy feature in here we just have there

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
handy feature in here we just have there
we<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.240> some<00:01:39.560> instructions<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
we go we just have some instructions and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.770 
we go we just have some instructions and
obviously<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> drivers<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.630> probably

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
obviously the drivers which you probably

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
obviously the drivers which you probably
want<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> drivers<00:01:43.680> off<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> site

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
want to get the drivers off the site

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.700 
want to get the drivers off the site
they're<00:01:45.180> probably<00:01:45.540> newer<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> better<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
they're probably newer and better and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
they're probably newer and better and
here's<00:01:47.159> two<00:01:47.369> batteries<00:01:47.759> Duracell<00:01:48.240> which<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
here's two batteries Duracell which so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.310
