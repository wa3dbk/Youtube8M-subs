14<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:00.960> last<00:00:01.319> one<00:00:01.500> on<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.740> truck<00:00:02.100> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
14 is the last one on this truck the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.980 
14 is the last one on this truck the
first<00:00:02.820> thing<00:00:03.030> that<00:00:03.060> we<00:00:03.240> do<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.540> try<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.780> put

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
first thing that we do is try and put

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.019 
first thing that we do is try and put
the<00:00:04.080> soundtrack<00:00:04.529> together<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.879> that

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
the soundtrack together and so that

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.940 
the soundtrack together and so that
takes<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.330> little<00:00:06.359> while<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.899> get<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.350> get<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
takes a little while to get it get the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.740 
takes a little while to get it get the
right<00:00:08.040> length<00:00:08.460> depending<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> budget<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
right length depending on the budget and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660 
right length depending on the budget and
so<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.650> once<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:10.980> get<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.190> soundtrack

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so on so and once you get the soundtrack

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.690 
so on so and once you get the soundtrack
together<00:00:12.030> then<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.420> go<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.580> apply<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
together then we go and apply the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.300 
together then we go and apply the
fireworks<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> music<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:17.190> have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
fireworks to the music so you have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
fireworks to the music so you have
crescendos<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> middle<00:00:18.660> well<00:00:18.810> then

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
crescendos in the middle well then

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.019 
crescendos in the middle well then
you'll<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.140> larger<00:00:19.650> devices<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.699> course<00:00:20.850> in

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
you'll have larger devices of course in

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.929 
you'll have larger devices of course in
the<00:00:21.119> finale<00:00:21.390> alive<00:00:21.810> huge<00:00:22.140> Thunder<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> several

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the finale alive huge Thunder of several

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.630 
the finale alive huge Thunder of several
devices<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.689> time<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.430> all

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
devices at one time so that's all

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 
devices at one time so that's all
programmed<00:00:27.240> into<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> computer<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:28.439> we

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
programmed into the computer then we

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.330 
programmed into the computer then we
come<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> morning<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.960> event<00:00:31.189> set<00:00:32.189> up

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
come in the morning of the event set up

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
come in the morning of the event set up
all<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> pipe<00:00:32.969> put<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.899> shells<00:00:34.680> into

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
all the pipe put all the shells into

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
all the pipe put all the shells into
each<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> mortars<00:00:35.730> wire<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
each of the mortars wire them in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
each of the mortars wire them in the
sequence<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.920> them<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> be

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
sequence that we want them to be

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.150 
sequence that we want them to be
launched<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.140> hook<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> computers<00:00:40.649> into<00:00:41.010> our

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
launched and hook the computers into our

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
launched and hook the computers into our
diagnostics<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.210> ready<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.660> 2<00:00:43.379> 4<00:00:43.620> 6

diagnostics and we're ready to go 2 4 6

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670 
diagnostics and we're ready to go 2 4 6
is<00:00:44.100> correct<00:00:44.520> you've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.300> two<00:00:45.539> wires<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
is correct you've got two wires going to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
is correct you've got two wires going to
each<00:00:46.920> device<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.610> we've<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> thousand

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
each device so we've got a thousand

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.299 
each device so we've got a thousand
devices<00:00:48.510> tonight<00:00:48.989> about<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> thousand<00:00:49.950> wires<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
devices tonight about a thousand wires a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
devices tonight about a thousand wires a
thousand<00:00:50.820> mortars<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:52.320> they<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.739> come

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
thousand mortars so then they all come

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.000 
thousand mortars so then they all come
back<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.809> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> grid<00:00:55.320> back<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
back into a kind of a grid back to the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.670 
back into a kind of a grid back to the
computer<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.379> consolidated<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
computer it's all consolidated down to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
computer it's all consolidated down to
just<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.129> pair<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.510> pair<00:01:00.750> will

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
just one pair and then one pair will

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
just one pair and then one pair will
send<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.260> power<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.770> data<00:01:02.090> out<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.359> each<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
send out power and data out to each of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.520 
send out power and data out to each of
the<00:01:03.840> devices<00:01:04.309> there<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.400> also<00:01:05.549> an<00:01:05.909> additional

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
the devices there are also an additional

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.310 
the devices there are also an additional
35<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.310> smaller<00:01:09.049> computers<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> are

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
35 or so smaller computers that are

very center explodes and sends out the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
very center explodes and sends out the
color<00:01:35.340> stars<00:01:35.700> chlorates<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.869> example<00:01:37.229> make

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
color stars chlorates for example make

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.840 
color stars chlorates for example make
blue<00:01:37.850> barium<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.950> green<00:01:40.950> charcoal

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
blue barium will make a green charcoal

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.749 
blue barium will make a green charcoal
will<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.430> gold<00:01:44.430> color

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.609 
mix those are the primary ingredients to
make<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> color<00:01:51.090> they're<00:01:51.570> all<00:01:51.689> hand<00:01:52.140> placed

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
make the color they're all hand placed

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460 
make the color they're all hand placed
into<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> device<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> which

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
into the device and so the way in which

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
into the device and so the way in which
you<00:01:55.740> place<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.460> determines<00:01:56.969> what

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you place them in there determines what

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.389 
you place them in there determines what
the<00:01:58.049> appearance<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.590> look<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> sky

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the appearance will look like in the sky

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
the appearance will look like in the sky
we<00:02:00.030> shoot<00:02:00.270> some<00:02:00.299> fairly<00:02:00.600> large<00:02:00.750> devices<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
we shoot some fairly large devices up to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
we shoot some fairly large devices up to
6<00:02:02.009> inch<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.369> diameter<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.479> slightly

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
6 inch in diameter so it's slightly

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.530 
6 inch in diameter so it's slightly
smaller<00:02:03.990> than<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.530> basketball<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
smaller than a basketball and they go to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.410 
smaller than a basketball and they go to
600<00:02:07.110> feet<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.860> lowest<00:02:08.550> one<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.879> three<00:02:09.209> inch

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
600 feet the lowest one is three inch

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
600 feet the lowest one is three inch
and<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.750> goes<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> 300<00:02:10.500> feet<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> spread<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and it goes to 300 feet with a spread of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.950 
and it goes to 300 feet with a spread of
150<00:02:12.030> feet<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.540> some<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
150 feet it's some of the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.660 
150 feet it's some of the
large<00:02:13.110> booms<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.950> you'll<00:02:14.160> hear<00:02:14.340> during<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
large booms that you'll hear during the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.820 
large booms that you'll hear during the
program<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.630> call<00:02:15.840> those<00:02:16.020> salutes<00:02:16.470> they're

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
program we call those salutes they're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.230 
program we call those salutes they're
actually<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.430> even<00:02:17.940> though<00:02:18.030> they're<00:02:18.210> very

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
actually that even though they're very

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.090 
actually that even though they're very
very<00:02:18.660> loud<00:02:18.870> they're<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> smallest<00:02:19.590> device<00:02:19.860> we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
very loud they're the smallest device we

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.150 
very loud they're the smallest device we
have<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.850> fuse<00:02:21.150> burns<00:02:21.690> 60<00:02:22.530> feet<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.710> second

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
have this fuse burns 60 feet a second

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.060 
have this fuse burns 60 feet a second
we'll<00:02:23.370> light<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.480> very<00:02:24.720> end<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.920> then

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
we'll light the very end one and then

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.850 
we'll light the very end one and then
these<00:02:26.280> ten<00:02:26.580> will<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:26.910> go<00:02:27.180> within<00:02:27.870> well<00:02:28.440> about

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
these ten will all go within well about

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.640 
these ten will all go within well about
a<00:02:28.920> half<00:02:29.190> second<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.630> each<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.350> these<00:02:31.440> will

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
a half second and so each of these will

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.100 
a half second and so each of these will
be<00:02:31.680> ignited<00:02:32.010> roughly<00:02:32.670> about<00:02:32.790> Oh<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.510> second

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
be ignited roughly about Oh a second

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.530 
be ignited roughly about Oh a second
maybe<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> second<00:02:34.920> half<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.280> part<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.880> so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
maybe a second half the part and so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.770 
maybe a second half the part and so
they'll<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:36.870> run<00:02:37.140> down<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> line<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.950> ten

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
they'll just run down the line just ten

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.450 
they'll just run down the line just ten
shot<00:02:39.780> every<00:02:40.050> time<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.040> finale<00:02:41.340> is

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
shot every time I think the finale is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.330 
shot every time I think the finale is
about<00:02:41.670> 15<00:02:42.150> seconds<00:02:42.630> long<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.200> we'll<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.070> going

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
about 15 seconds long but we'll be going

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.660 
about 15 seconds long but we'll be going
through

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
through

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.020 
through
oh<00:02:44.910> gosh<00:02:45.840> almost<00:02:46.140> 200<00:02:46.710> 250<00:02:47.400> shells<00:02:47.670> something

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
oh gosh almost 200 250 shells something

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.460 
oh gosh almost 200 250 shells something
like<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:48.600> 15<00:02:49.020> seconds

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like that and that's 15 seconds

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.380 
like that and that's 15 seconds
certainly<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.610> end<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.940> finale<00:02:51.270> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
certainly at the end of the finale you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.240 
certainly at the end of the finale you
can<00:02:51.600> hear<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.020> people<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.440> are<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:53.100> at<00:02:53.220> the
