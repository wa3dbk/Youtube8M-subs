00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 om 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.060
 then 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.350
 of Saturday in front of sand fishermen I am certain for some 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.190
 Benmosche 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 to the next can on the score of tranquility 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 the challenge with nature 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 seductive morning rendezvous 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 we are very lucky today the most beautiful 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.760
 it's a nice day test 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 first sun link took place from August 15th 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 oil opens up 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.840
 they are archetypes 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.930
 this descent into the underworld of France 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.670
 formats 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 not very nice 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 carrabba not carved by the bank 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 which is funny finally it's a bit silly 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.049
 they know that I'm telling the truth 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.679
 when we lead to the post it's impressive 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.679
 at jaffa europa tonight is good 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.399
 308 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 when village 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.599
 I think the trace it was not there would not be that I went up 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.589
 john crowley's movie 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.589
 opening 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.129
 if you are not a small pandemic 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.569
 in a few days the important portals underlined 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.349
 for the extent that 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.019
 we will say that the other three quarters of the people we see here come for 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.779
 the opening day stephen harper 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.599
 I'm going to destroy who can help 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.529
 devolder of what is commonly called 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:44.959
 a vogue 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.929
 three are there to be taken in the aisles in a week before I 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.929
 been there for the market too 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.539
 elevated they are more reactive in the blood continues 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.199
 dolphin of the term that is to say that 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.989
 we can present them anything in front of the mouth theoretically aldo 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.299
 trimble the recover 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.589
 it's six-point fishing that's a shame 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:11.259
 edmÃ©e here is the real trophy I think today is the one who 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.259
 will take a real fario spotted with red 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.620
 for the fins are not spoiled from this problem of aged freeze while 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.739
 only in the basins 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.620
 she rubs her hands players against against the basins and like the basins 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.620
 are heard 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.779
 the lessons of the mekong 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.419
 it's not started 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.419
 the statutes here are men status 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.150
 and well in fact we do not need to learn when we peel euros 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
 this statue I will leave only difference 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.249
 it can be 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.449
 the day of opening I'm not sure it's really sporty 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 this closure of the mobility more we still wait for the cap 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.210
 the real sin stansell louron move where we will see 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.300
 a little in all the style holes 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.969
 the fish that is hiding 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.710
 so that I think we have to wait another three weeks time 

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.169
 that loneliness trout 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.169
 then their environment for all to fetch% 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.249
 in their environment 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:20.659
 trout 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.209
 I think that three-quarters have peeled today effectively the 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.360
 three quarters of toddlers 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.910
 besides a nice opening people have taken a lot of a lot of stuff 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.729
 each 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.180
 we did not make the total of each better fisherman yet 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.180
 I think most of the heads will be taken 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.800
 it is besides the problem of the reuse only of rivers 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.279
 to know if we are reintroducing farmed trout or if we are doing rearing or 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.260
 and have them build as soon as the best solution was still to 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.120
 to improve the quality of the river 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.670
 and southern regeneration and wild trout is done automatically 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.729
 Valentine's Day 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.009
 after twelve pieces 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.749
 an agreement that is 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.819
 but not necessarily it is because we put to the big anger
