if<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.160> wasn't<00:01:52.490> for<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.700> fact<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.090> they<00:01:53.270> zoom

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
if it wasn't for the fact that they zoom

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.480 
if it wasn't for the fact that they zoom
in<00:01:53.870> at<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.140> part<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.770> probably<00:01:55.250> wouldn't<00:01:55.430> be

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490

that<00:01:55.700> bad<00:01:56.170> but<00:01:57.170> unfortunately<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:58.940> bad

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
that bad but unfortunately it's bad

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.180

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.710

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
look at this looks like why do we have

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.730 
look at this looks like why do we have
to<00:02:11.690> zoom<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.110> when<00:02:12.320> they<00:02:12.770> can't<00:02:13.130> see<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.700> shit

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
to zoom in when they can't see the shit

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:23.230 
to zoom in when they can't see the shit
it's<00:02:14.860> unnecessary

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.600
