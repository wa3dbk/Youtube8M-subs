 experience here too sometimes the climate in this 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:01.330

 led1 back offset 50 grams even 50 grams 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.310
 more than a thousand good experiences in principle 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.700
 Now I pause and in a day 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.810
 as the law itself let's go sell to the store 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 and see how much money they give for this 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:06.580
 like a machine gun so he went nibble 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.270
 just events here you can see han fish 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.480
 fished out 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.480
 On 7 game here is lucky 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.540
 for the third time takes wars of this 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.030
 Tasmanian minnow I have all the nerves 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.640
 you about how a ending is starting 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.920
 records so the sound and video disappears 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.880
 whether the sound disappears either 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.510
 Generally and ending the general I went sold 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.740
 sold nil 300 all this x shot 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.850
 starting to watch the video no 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.290
 the ending nil 300l sold sold 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.930
 This Tasmanian Minnow 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.270
 one hundred and sixty pieces were caught 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:08.180
 about 120 of them and offset 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:10.580
 a large percentage of eligible fish now 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.250
 not in price principle when u not in price 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.430
 You can go if in the price Tasmanian 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.420
 gudgeon to catch it or large live bait 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.180
 but the big living experience does not give normal 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.560
 and the Tasmanian minnow gives you the fields 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.080
 possible in principle 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.760
 net earn it fishing rods not 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.970
 killed here lam 300 caught sold 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:40.100
 300,000 ticket is worth here lam top and 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:43.640
 principle 120 credits generally 160 about 200 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.180
 250 thousand experiences just to donk melancholy and 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.620
 sand wines if you wish you can 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.650
 go but it's basically 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.710
 I don't know whether to buy a ticket 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.030
 meaning is unlikely if hand fish only 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.120
 catch or platypus 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.169
 And so for Tasmanian minnow he voucher 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.379
 not even true 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.219
 eggs if you buy it at a flea market or 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:09.759
 where there thanks for watching everyone 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.759
 until
