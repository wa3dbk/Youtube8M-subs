00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:53.170
 level by level draw a cart and 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.449
 this strip can be nailed 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:09.830
 guide strip drawn 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:16.870
 we are dreaming so 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:20.110
 first interrupting the bottom and dowel-nail 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.500

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.500
 nail the top guides 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:32.850
 so that was the right angle and hang 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:36.600
