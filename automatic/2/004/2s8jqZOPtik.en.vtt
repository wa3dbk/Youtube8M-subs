you don't want to be eating here we have

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.719 
you don't want to be eating here we have
a<00:01:59.200> stainless<00:01:59.710> steel<00:01:59.740> pan<00:02:00.100> now<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.460> would<00:02:00.610> be

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
a stainless steel pan now this would be

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.670 
a stainless steel pan now this would be
great<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.390> only<00:02:01.570> problem<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.200> pen<00:02:02.530> is

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
great the only problem is this pen is

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.859 
great the only problem is this pen is
mirrored<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.310> if<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.030> get<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.329> pan<00:02:04.570> hot

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
mirrored and if you get this pan hot

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.420 
mirrored and if you get this pan hot
enough<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.320> get<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.590> nice<00:02:05.799> sear<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.369> steak

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
enough to get the nice sear on the steak

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.070 
enough to get the nice sear on the steak
you're<00:02:06.850> actually<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.420> discolor<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
you're actually going to discolor the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.380 
you're actually going to discolor the
pan<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.009> unless<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.310> got<00:02:09.429> like<00:02:09.610> an<00:02:09.729> old<00:02:09.940> grungy

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
pan so unless you got like an old grungy

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.610 
pan so unless you got like an old grungy
pan<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.810> don't<00:02:10.959> really<00:02:11.080> care<00:02:11.200> about

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
pan and you don't really care about

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.900 
pan and you don't really care about
I<00:02:11.739> wouldn't<00:02:12.280> recommend<00:02:12.580> using<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.030> first<00:02:13.300> take

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
I wouldn't recommend using it first take

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.809 
I wouldn't recommend using it first take
this<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:17.019> we<00:02:17.140> used<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> make<00:02:17.560> things<00:02:17.819> this

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
this is what we used to make things this

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.400 
this is what we used to make things this
is<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.000> cast<00:02:19.269> iron<00:02:19.510> pan<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.019> thing<00:02:20.200> probably

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
is a cast iron pan this thing probably

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.270 
is a cast iron pan this thing probably
weighs<00:02:20.680> no<00:02:21.310> I'm<00:02:21.519> not<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.819> 510<00:02:22.810> pounds<00:02:23.280> but

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
weighs no I'm not like 510 pounds but

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.009 
weighs no I'm not like 510 pounds but
it's<00:02:24.430> real<00:02:24.700> heavy<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.180> got<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.330> thick<00:02:25.750> bottom

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
it's real heavy it's got a thick bottom

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.089 
it's real heavy it's got a thick bottom
so<00:02:26.319> we're<00:02:26.440> going<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> be<00:02:26.680> able<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.860> get<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
so we're going to be able to get this

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.100 
so we're going to be able to get this
pan<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.790> hot<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.480> gonna<00:02:28.599> give<00:02:28.840> us<00:02:28.959> an

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
pan really hot it's gonna give us an

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.530 
pan really hot it's gonna give us an

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
used to make a steak it

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.809 
used to make a steak it
some<00:02:38.500> people<00:02:38.860> will<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.280> know<00:02:39.370> say<00:02:39.580> they<00:02:39.670> like

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
some people will you know say they like

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.520 
some people will you know say they like
to<00:02:39.940> use<00:02:40.000> butter<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.569> pump<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:40.959> butter<00:02:41.290> is

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
to use butter and pump with butter is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.470 
to use butter and pump with butter is
you<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:41.890> hot<00:02:42.130> enough<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.819> put<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.239> steak

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
you get it hot enough to put the steak

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.610 
you get it hot enough to put the steak
in<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.530> gonna<00:02:44.739> burn<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:46.720> well<00:02:47.260> another

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
in and it's gonna burn all well another

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.259 
in and it's gonna burn all well another
popular<00:02:48.099> choice<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.700> know<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> problem

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
popular choice but you know the problem

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.850 
popular choice but you know the problem
with<00:02:49.299> this<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.440> got<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> little

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
with this is that it's got a little

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.559 
with this is that it's got a little
smoke<00:02:51.220> point<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:51.610> again<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.120> get<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.299> hot

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
smoke point so again you get a hot

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.229 
smoke point so again you get a hot
enough<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.019> gonna<00:02:53.230> burn<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.880> thing<00:02:55.060> is

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
enough and it's gonna burn the thing is

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.300 
enough and it's gonna burn the thing is
if<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> steak<00:02:56.380> with<00:02:56.410> enough<00:02:56.860> marbling

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
if you have a steak with enough marbling

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.460 
if you have a steak with enough marbling
in<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.579> it's<00:02:57.790> got<00:02:57.940> enough<00:02:58.329> fat<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.959> its<00:02:59.110> own<00:02:59.290> but

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
in it it's got enough fat on its own but

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.470 
in it it's got enough fat on its own but
you<00:02:59.590> actually<00:02:59.950> don't<00:03:00.340> need<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.579> use<00:03:00.790> any<00:03:01.090> oil

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
you actually don't need to use any oil

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.809 
you actually don't need to use any oil
in<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> pan<00:03:01.989> if<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:02.680> making<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.100> steak<00:03:03.430> like

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
in the pan if you're making a steak like

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.550 
in the pan if you're making a steak like
filet<00:03:04.239> mignon<00:03:04.660> or<00:03:04.690> something<00:03:05.260> that's<00:03:05.410> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
filet mignon or something that's a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.930 
filet mignon or something that's a
little<00:03:05.769> bit<00:03:05.980> leaner<00:03:06.220> you're<00:03:06.489> gonna<00:03:06.609> want<00:03:06.880> to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
little bit leaner you're gonna want to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.849 
little bit leaner you're gonna want to
use<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.090> little<00:03:07.390> bit<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.690> oil<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> trick<00:03:08.829> is

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
use a little bit of oil but the trick is

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.830 
use a little bit of oil but the trick is
you<00:03:09.100> use<00:03:09.459> salad<00:03:10.180> oil<00:03:10.269> something<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
you use salad oil something with a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.900 
you use salad oil something with a
really<00:03:11.170> high<00:03:11.350> smoke<00:03:11.410> point<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.489> just<00:03:12.639> rub

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
really high smoke point and you just rub

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.640 
really high smoke point and you just rub
