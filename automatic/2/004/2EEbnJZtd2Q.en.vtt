like<00:03:11.480> cut<00:03:11.690> them<00:03:11.810> open<00:03:11.930> or<00:03:12.200> something<00:03:12.580> after<00:03:13.580> a

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
like cut them open or something after a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.150 
like cut them open or something after a
while<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.299> plasma<00:03:14.989> ball<00:03:15.200> will<00:03:15.470> form<00:03:15.769> it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
while like a plasma ball will form it

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640 
while like a plasma ball will form it
will<00:03:16.610> float<00:03:17.000> like<00:03:17.420> above<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.019> thing<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.590> the
