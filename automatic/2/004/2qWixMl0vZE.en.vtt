let's see I think I'm going to mark it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.859 
let's see I think I'm going to mark it
on<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.530> side<00:01:28.909> because<00:01:29.909> i<00:01:30.150> had<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.630> seam

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
on this side because i had this seam

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
on this side because i had this seam
right<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.070> where<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
right here and i know this is where this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
right here and i know this is where this
closes<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.540> i<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.200> use<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> reference

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
closes so i can use that as a reference

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
closes so i can use that as a reference
as<00:01:35.340> pretend<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> regular

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
