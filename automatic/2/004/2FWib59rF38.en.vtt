playstation 4 DualShock 4 controller
basically<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.320> rubber<00:00:10.740> grips<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.099> stick

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
basically just rubber grips that stick

basically just rubber grips that stick
onto<00:00:11.700> your<00:00:12.059> triggers<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.860> controller<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
onto your triggers on the controller to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.829 
onto your triggers on the controller to
give<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.460> some<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:14.969> grip<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.389> your<00:00:15.540> triggers

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
give you some more grip on your triggers

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.260 
give you some more grip on your triggers
so<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.010> already<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.580> extra<00:00:17.850> set<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.060> these

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.500 
chance to win a set of these trigger
treads<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.870> getting<00:00:37.590> into<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> review

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
treads so getting into the review

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.930 
treads so getting into the review
basically<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.320> said<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.890> grips<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
basically like I said just grips that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
basically like I said just grips that
stick<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.620> triggers<00:00:43.950> they<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.370> have

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
stick on to your triggers they just have

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
stick on to your triggers they just have
some<00:00:44.700> adhesive<00:00:45.329> back<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> can

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
some adhesive back in and then you can

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.049 
some adhesive back in and then you can
just<00:00:46.620> peel<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.800> off<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.340> simply<00:00:47.640> stick<00:00:47.879> them

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
just peel it off and simply stick them

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.090 
just peel it off and simply stick them
onto<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.629> existing<00:00:48.780> triggers<00:00:49.500> you'd<00:00:49.950> have

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
onto your existing triggers you'd have

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
onto your existing triggers you'd have
to<00:00:50.250> replace<00:00:50.550> anything<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.329> pretty<00:00:51.480> cool

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
to replace anything so it's pretty cool

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.979 
to replace anything so it's pretty cool
very<00:00:52.020> simple<00:00:52.350> concept<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.780> basically<00:00:54.780> just

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
very simple concept and basically just

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.420 
very simple concept and basically just
gives<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.410> grip<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.190> like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
gives you more grip and they are like

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.599 
gives you more grip and they are like
kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.360> themed<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> car<00:00:58.379> tire<00:00:58.680> tread

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
kind of themed with a car tire tread

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.979 
kind of themed with a car tire tread
as<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.120> trigger<00:01:00.510> triggers<00:01:00.780> get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
as you can see trigger triggers get

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.319 
as you can see trigger triggers get
traction<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> action<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.120> have

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
traction on the action and then you have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
traction on the action and then you have
a<00:01:03.359> racing<00:01:03.899> rubber<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.710> all-terrain

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a racing rubber and you have all-terrain

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
a racing rubber and you have all-terrain
rubber<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> themed<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
rubber so it is kind of themed like a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.750 
rubber so it is kind of themed like a
car<00:01:07.619> tire<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> quite<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> it's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
car tire and I quite like that it's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
car tire and I quite like that it's
pretty<00:01:08.880> cool<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.020> there's<00:01:10.200> two<00:01:10.320> different

very<00:01:35.970> easily<00:01:36.350> stuck<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.530> very<00:01:37.920> well<00:01:38.159> very

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
very easily stuck on very well very

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600 
very easily stuck on very well very
easily<00:01:39.079> they<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.229> comic<00:01:40.590> surface<00:01:41.040> area<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
easily they do comic surface area of the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
easily they do comic surface area of the
trigger<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.090> smaller<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.630> obviously

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
trigger a bit smaller because obviously

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960 
trigger a bit smaller because obviously
the<00:01:43.829> rubber<00:01:44.040> grip<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.579> smaller<00:01:44.909> than

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the rubber grip has to be smaller than

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
the rubber grip has to be smaller than
the<00:01:45.090> trigger<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.540> stick<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the trigger to stick on so the kind of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240 
the trigger to stick on so the kind of
grip<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.060> slightly<00:01:48.299> smaller<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.250> definitely

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
grip is slightly smaller but definitely

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
grip is slightly smaller but definitely
way<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.700> way<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:51.540> grip<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.590> you're

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
way more way more grip when you're

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.499 
way more way more grip when you're
playing<00:01:53.490> games<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.850> racing<00:01:54.360> games

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
playing games like racing games

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.819 
playing games like racing games
especially<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.409> give<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.770> extra

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
especially this will give you that extra

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.800 
especially this will give you that extra
grip<00:01:56.250> specially<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.790> you're<00:01:56.939> holding<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
grip specially when you're holding the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.020 
grip specially when you're holding the
triggers<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.140> long<00:01:58.409> periods<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.860> time<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.280> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
triggers for long periods of time so it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.249 
triggers for long periods of time so it
definitely<00:02:00.180> does<00:02:00.509> give<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> extra<00:02:01.020> grip

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
definitely does give you the extra grip

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
definitely does give you the extra grip
and<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.460> they're<00:02:02.610> quite<00:02:02.759> thick

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and I also like that they're quite thick

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.819 
and I also like that they're quite thick
as<00:02:03.210> well<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.530> quite<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
as well as you can see they have quite a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.649 
as well as you can see they have quite a
fair<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> thickness<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.540> they

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
fair bit of thickness to them so they

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
fair bit of thickness to them so they
add<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.110> slight<00:02:07.890> thickness<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> triggers

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
add the slight thickness to the triggers

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.050 
add the slight thickness to the triggers
and<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.720> actually<00:02:09.840> quite<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.500> feel<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and I'm actually quite like that feel it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
and I'm actually quite like that feel it
almost<00:02:12.510> makes<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.840> makes<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
almost makes it makes you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470 
almost makes it makes you
like<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.890> triggers<00:02:14.220> are<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.520> higher<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.210> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
like the triggers are a bit higher and a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.270 
like the triggers are a bit higher and a
bit<00:02:15.630> closer<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.050> your<00:02:16.170> fingers<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.620> actually

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
bit closer to your fingers and actually

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.550 
bit closer to your fingers and actually
really<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.140> racing

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
really like that so that's the racing

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.670 
really like that so that's the racing
rubber<00:02:19.800> style<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.880> did<00:02:21.330> install<00:02:21.630> only<00:02:21.930> one<00:02:22.410> of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
rubber style I did install only one of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.180 
rubber style I did install only one of
the<00:02:23.640> all-terrain<00:02:24.260> style<00:02:25.260> grip<00:02:25.800> as<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.070> can

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the all-terrain style grip as you can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.910 
the all-terrain style grip as you can
see<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.430> there<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> dis<00:02:27.240> lumpy<00:02:27.920> star

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
see right there kind of dis lumpy star

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.650 
see right there kind of dis lumpy star
as<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:30.060> one<00:02:30.240> doesn't<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.480> as

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
as you can see this one doesn't have as

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.480 
as you can see this one doesn't have as
much<00:02:30.780> grip<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.350> found<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.010> seems<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.370> little

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
much grip I found it it seems a little

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.280 
much grip I found it it seems a little
bit<00:02:32.700> more<00:02:32.850> slippery<00:02:33.209> than<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.720> other<00:02:33.959> star

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
bit more slippery than the other star

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.860 
bit more slippery than the other star
but<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.420> comfortable<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
but this way it's really comfortable is

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.840 
but this way it's really comfortable is
quite<00:02:37.020> soft<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:38.250> definitely<00:02:38.640> does<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
quite soft and it definitely does the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.600 
quite soft and it definitely does the
job<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.470> see<00:02:40.650> but<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.040> actually

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
job but if you can see but it's actually

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
job but if you can see but it's actually
labeled<00:02:41.850> with<00:02:42.630> which<00:02:42.959> trigger<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.560> which<00:02:43.740> so

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
labeled with which trigger is which so

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
labeled with which trigger is which so
it<00:02:44.010> does<00:02:44.160> have<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> small<00:02:45.020> label<00:02:46.020> right<00:02:46.170> there

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it does have a small label right there

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.590 
it does have a small label right there
that<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.590> says<00:02:46.830> r2<00:02:47.340> before<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.390> make<00:02:48.570> that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
that just says r2 before we make that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.500 
that just says r2 before we make that
out<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.770> know<00:02:49.890> which<00:02:50.130> one<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.970> stick

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
out just so you know which one to stick

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.790 
out just so you know which one to stick
on<00:02:51.720> which<00:02:51.930> trigger<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:52.709> are

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
on which trigger because they are

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.229 
on which trigger because they are
slightly<00:02:53.070> different<00:02:53.250> shapes<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.090> does

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
slightly different shapes so it does

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.330 
slightly different shapes so it does
matter<00:02:54.450> which<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.020> stick<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.590> so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
matter which one you stick on and so

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
matter which one you stick on and so
yeah<00:02:56.489> definitely<00:02:56.670> very<00:02:57.239> easy<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.720> install<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
yeah definitely very easy to install I

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.530 
yeah definitely very easy to install I
didn't<00:02:58.380> install<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.830> one<00:02:59.180> yet<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:00.450> I'll

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
didn't install this one yet but I'll

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.000 
didn't install this one yet but I'll
just<00:03:00.690> give<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:00.989> idea<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.350> how<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.800> his

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
just give you an idea of how it is his

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.940 
just give you an idea of how it is his
talk<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.489> basically<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.800> what

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
talk but basically this is this is what

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.160 
talk but basically this is this is what
you<00:03:05.040> get<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.400> packaging<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.050> a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you get in the packaging it's just a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.890 
you get in the packaging it's just a
rubber<00:03:07.380> grip<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:08.010> some<00:03:08.250> 3m<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.180> he<00:03:09.300> adhesive

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
rubber grip with some 3m and he adhesive

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.570 
rubber grip with some 3m and he adhesive
at<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.050> back<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> just<00:03:11.100> peel<00:03:11.280> off<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
at the back so you just peel off the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.370
