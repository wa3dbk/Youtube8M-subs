this<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:15.800> a<00:00:15.830> test<00:00:16.160> run<00:00:16.580> for<00:00:17.300> my<00:00:17.720> idea<00:00:19.240> when<00:00:20.240> I'm

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
this is a test run for my idea when I'm

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.660 
this is a test run for my idea when I'm
done<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:21.410> will<00:00:21.590> be<00:00:21.740> sitting<00:00:22.039> in<00:00:22.250> a<00:00:22.400> tank

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
done that will be sitting in a tank

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.150 
done that will be sitting in a tank
below<00:00:23.390> this<00:00:23.750> thing<00:00:24.110> which<00:00:24.380> will<00:00:24.590> be<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.740> planet

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
below this thing which will be a planet

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.760 
below this thing which will be a planet
thing<00:00:25.369> that'll<00:00:26.300> be<00:00:26.390> sitting<00:00:26.720> in<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.140> center

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
thing that'll be sitting in the center

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.370 
thing that'll be sitting in the center
with<00:00:28.669> overflows<00:00:29.300> draining<00:00:29.960> into<00:00:30.169> it<00:00:31.149> and<00:00:32.380> it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
with overflows draining into it and it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.639 
with overflows draining into it and it
will<00:00:33.530> overflow<00:00:33.920> over<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.520> top<00:00:34.820> of<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.649> glass

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
will overflow over the top of the glass

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.819 
will overflow over the top of the glass
tube<00:00:37.070> into<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.850> bottom<00:00:38.120> tank<00:00:38.390> I'm<00:00:39.140> thinking

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
tube into the bottom tank I'm thinking

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.920 
tube into the bottom tank I'm thinking
that<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.730> glass<00:00:40.969> tube<00:00:41.270> will<00:00:41.540> stick<00:00:41.809> up

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
that the glass tube will stick up

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.139 
that the glass tube will stick up
slightly<00:00:42.380> above<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.710> water<00:00:43.219> level<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.940> the

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
slightly above the water level and the

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.410 
slightly above the water level and the
other<00:00:44.300> tank<00:00:44.660> below<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.790> right<00:00:46.790> now<00:00:47.000> I<00:00:47.030> have

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
other tank below this right now I have

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.440 
other tank below this right now I have
it<00:00:47.600> set<00:00:47.780> up<00:00:48.760> with<00:00:49.760> my<00:00:50.420> trickle<00:00:51.230> filter<00:00:52.450> the

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
it set up with my trickle filter the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.750 
it set up with my trickle filter the
pump<00:00:53.690> coming<00:00:54.050> from<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.320> trickle<00:00:54.560> filter<00:00:55.070> which

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
pump coming from a trickle filter which

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.780 
pump coming from a trickle filter which
needs<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.030> go<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.240> a<00:00:56.360> spray<00:00:56.750> bar<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.579> replace<00:00:58.579> the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
needs to go to a spray bar I replace the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.260 
needs to go to a spray bar I replace the
spray<00:00:59.090> bar<00:00:59.360> with<00:00:59.690> a<00:01:00.520> straight<00:01:01.520> tube<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.210> goes

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
spray bar with a straight tube that goes

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.130 
spray bar with a straight tube that goes
down<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.930> bottom<00:01:03.079> of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.650> fluidized<00:01:04.309> sand

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
down to the bottom of the fluidized sand

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.060 
down to the bottom of the fluidized sand
-<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:07.070> had<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.939> put<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.240> little<00:01:08.770> hole<00:01:09.770> in<00:01:10.040> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
- I had to put this little hole in it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.770 
- I had to put this little hole in it
here<00:01:10.579> so<00:01:10.909> that<00:01:10.939> when<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:12.610> cut<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> power<00:01:13.880> that

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
here so that when I cut the power that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.510 
here so that when I cut the power that
doesn't<00:01:15.020> suck<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.560> sand<00:01:15.860> all<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.189> way<00:01:16.310> down

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
doesn't suck the sand all the way down

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.429 
doesn't suck the sand all the way down
into<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.180> filter<00:01:17.689> which<00:01:18.380> works<00:01:18.619> nicely<00:01:19.179> but

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
into the filter which works nicely but

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.169 
into the filter which works nicely but
when<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.530> power<00:01:21.679> comes<00:01:21.979> back<00:01:22.130> on<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.880> pumps

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
when the power comes back on the pumps

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.219 
when the power comes back on the pumps
not<00:01:23.240> enough<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.259> get<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.590> sand<00:01:25.039> moving<00:01:25.579> again

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
not enough to get the sand moving again

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.879 
not enough to get the sand moving again
maybe<00:01:27.229> just<00:01:27.859> that<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.159> have<00:01:28.780> too<00:01:29.780> much<00:01:30.049> sand<00:01:30.469> in

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889 
maybe just that I have too much sand in

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.550 
maybe just that I have too much sand in
tune<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.149> I<00:01:32.270> need<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.569> cut<00:01:32.749> down<00:01:32.959> on<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.259> little

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
tune and I need to cut down on a little

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.849 
tune and I need to cut down on a little
bit<00:01:33.740> which<00:01:33.920> I<00:01:34.069> could<00:01:34.280> do<00:01:35.139> there's<00:01:36.139> quite<00:01:36.679> a<00:01:36.709> bit

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
bit which I could do there's quite a bit

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.959 
bit which I could do there's quite a bit
of<00:01:36.889> saying<00:01:39.069> tank<00:01:40.069> is<00:01:40.249> still<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:40.459> little<00:01:40.639> murky

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
of saying tank is still a little murky

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.789 
of saying tank is still a little murky
from<00:01:42.009> when<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.039> had<00:01:43.840> even<00:01:44.840> more<00:01:45.139> sand<00:01:45.469> in<00:01:45.649> and

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
from when I had even more sand in and

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.669 
from when I had even more sand in and
when<00:01:45.889> I<00:01:45.920> first<00:01:46.189> cut<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:48.049> created<00:01:48.409> a

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
when I first cut it on and it created a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:56.889 
when I first cut it on and it created a
pretty<00:01:49.399> large<00:01:50.380> sand<00:01:52.329> plume<00:01:53.329> in<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.840> water<00:01:55.899> for

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
pretty large sand plume in the water for

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.389 
pretty large sand plume in the water for
those<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.529> have<00:01:57.679> never<00:01:57.889> seen<00:01:58.159> my

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
setup before this is my turtle tank and

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.170 
setup before this is my turtle tank and
this<00:02:01.579> is<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.909> topper<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.509> feel

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this is the topper that I feel

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.920 
this is the topper that I feel
or<00:02:03.480> I've<00:02:04.380> had<00:02:04.530> diets<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.600> extensions<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.840> the
