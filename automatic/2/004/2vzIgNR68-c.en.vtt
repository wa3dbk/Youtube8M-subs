00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
girls have their dreams and they're just

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.500 
girls have their dreams and they're just
kind<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.250> hanging<00:03:26.459> out<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.940> Piper's<00:03:27.299> just

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
kind of hanging out and Piper's just

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.300 
kind of hanging out and Piper's just
standing<00:03:28.350> around<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.650> don't<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:29.010> her<00:03:29.070> honest

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
standing around I don't have her honest

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.330 
standing around I don't have her honest
and<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:30.329> less<00:03:30.570> space<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.140> way<00:03:31.290> sometimes<00:03:32.220> I

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and just less space that way sometimes I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.310 
and just less space that way sometimes I
find<00:03:32.579> it's<00:03:32.880> easier<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.420> stand<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.930> girls<00:03:34.140> up

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
find it's easier to stand the girls up

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.470 
find it's easier to stand the girls up
against<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.769> wall<00:03:34.950> than<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.090> clip<00:03:36.299> them

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
against a wall than it is to clip them

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.360 
against a wall than it is to clip them
onto<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> stand<00:03:37.110> if<00:03:37.320> possible<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.160> their

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
onto a stand if possible and if their

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.400 
onto a stand if possible and if their
limbs<00:03:39.030> are<00:03:39.239> tight<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.810> definitely<00:03:40.049> do<00:03:40.380> it

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
limbs are tight you can definitely do it

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.470 
limbs are tight you can definitely do it
and<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.799> takes<00:03:40.980> up<00:03:41.100> less<00:03:41.310> space<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.910> when
