00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.339
 hi friends with you I do Thorvald 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.620
 recently made a video on how to store 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.320
 money how to handle them in everyday life and 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.730
 I got an unreal amount 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.980
 questions just a flurry of questions 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.220
 where to keep money or where to wear 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.880
 purse where to keep it in the summer when 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.230
 warm when there is no outerwear on the body 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.419
 yes and 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.489
 but some bags with a purse 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.070
 do not want to wear but can not all 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.860
 here at the click of the fingers here are all the people will 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.840
 wear a purse now yeah well as not 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.870
 want it there are people walking in shorts and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.700
 T-shirts yes and I advised not to keep 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.030
 money in your pocket with crumpled 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.970
 and what is there to keep them and the guys have the answer 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.350
 there is a good answer and despite the fact that 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.990
 I mostly do the video exactly 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.850
 psychological orientation yes but I 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.700
 I will do this for you especially 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.070
 simple household practical advice yes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.740
 because well everyone needs yes I'm going to 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.890
 meeting the audience so there are guys 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.170
 I get such a thing out of my pocket 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.690
 such a thing will help you like this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.850
 looks from the front side like this 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.040
 looks from the back 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.050
 called money clip 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.420
 he has this compartment behind him 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.310
 little things she 's like outside that is he 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 consists of two halves which 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.810
 add up keep money yes here 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.549
 there are two magnets placed you know 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.229
 now here are sold there on 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.840
 internet sites sometimes there in some 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.240
 souvenir shops you can buy 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.110
 very strong magnets which are such 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.880
 stick to the refrigerator there not to tear off 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.780
 here it turns out here are two such little ring 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.080
 magnetic it costs real well so 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.119
 magnetized here it turns out that's 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.250
 compartment for little things but really outside 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.110
 i.e. how many little things stuffed 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.540
 it does not interfere with this 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.860
 halves means guys are all very 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.439
 just that is, like this 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 laid out here lie your money they 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.520
 pressed here is a parenthesis in my 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.800
 long use here already 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.780
 It becomes loose but it is a cheap thing 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.440
 bought there somewhere in Moscow 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.260
 in the passage near the metro Avenue of the World 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.600
 somewhere out there is absolutely not expensive here 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.700
 the bracket that presses in the middle 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.340
 bills a little bit loose but the principle 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.960
 the volume that you got out of your pocket 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.090
 so it looks like that is what you get 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.100
 out of pocket also that's for sure yes 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.080
 presented in shorts and T-shirt 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.390
 got out of pocket so cool 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.650
 handy thing where you neatly 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.410
 folded money lie yes here you open 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.330
 like this you take a hand like this 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.790
 take in your hand then there is a bracket here this 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.550
 throw away the side we either here you took 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.040
 as if that's finger pulled back all the money 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.010
 you take it from here to it 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.840
 please, how much you have given there 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.150
 all this then took some task 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.330
 neatly folded everything you put here 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.160
 brace in the middle pressed 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.180
 close and all here you neatly 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.510
 everything turns out 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.030
 money is not crumpled very cool stored 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.560
 how could you all pick up that is in 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.170
 any leather goods 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.380
 but where they usually sell wallets 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.140
 almost always there are such clamps 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.330
 that is, there are all kinds of housekeepers there 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.980

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.959

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.810
 Pocket it is there like a back pocket 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.989
 put people nothing because you have 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.120
 from there all pulled out if you grew up there 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.979
 where there are very few pickpockets thugs 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.750
