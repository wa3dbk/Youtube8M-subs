00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
going to dictate it to 30 to 32 feet but
people<00:02:26.370> come<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.790> me<00:02:26.909> and<00:02:27.090> say<00:02:27.239> well<00:02:27.420> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
people come up to me and say well I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
people come up to me and say well I
don't<00:02:28.080> want<00:02:28.290> something<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.890> long<00:02:29.159> I<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.550> it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
don't want something that long I want it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.490 
don't want something that long I want it
shorter<00:02:29.909> what<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.379> make

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
shorter what can I do but you can make

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.160 
shorter what can I do but you can make
it<00:02:31.650> shorter<00:02:32.010> okay<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.450> make<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.810> shorter

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it shorter okay and you make it shorter

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.259 
it shorter okay and you make it shorter
by<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.590> cutting<00:02:34.830> off<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.580> segments<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
by just cutting off the segments of

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.270 
by just cutting off the segments of
these<00:02:36.629> pipes<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.290> need<00:02:37.470> over<00:02:37.709> here<00:02:37.890> but

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
these pipes that you need over here but

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.640 
these pipes that you need over here but
we<00:02:38.430> normally<00:02:38.819> put<00:02:38.999> these<00:02:39.269> these<00:02:39.749> pipes<00:02:40.109> in<00:02:40.379> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
we normally put these these pipes in the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.570 
we normally put these these pipes in the
frame<00:02:41.569> about<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.810> four<00:02:43.260> foot<00:02:43.530> lengths

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
frame about in four foot lengths

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
frame about in four foot lengths
okay<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.880> building<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.300> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> be

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
okay so so the building is going to be

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:58.640 
okay so so the building is going to be
17<00:02:49.230> x<00:02:49.830> 4<00:02:50.460> 8<00:02:51.240> 12<00:02:52.280> 16<00:02:53.510> 20<00:02:54.510> 24<00:02:55.460> 28<00:02:56.570> 32<00:02:57.570> okay<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
17 x 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 okay the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.070 
17 x 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 okay the
