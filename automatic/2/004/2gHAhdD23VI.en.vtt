00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:26.130
 so here we do not like the hostess 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.500
 hi with you athlon 1987 and m26 pershing 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 a long time ago I appeared in the hangar 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.250
 super pershing and after big 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.800
 the number of battles conducted on it 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 I got the impression that the usual 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.079
 Pershing will all punch because he 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.210
 no screens he has almost the same gun 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.760
 think there is more than 10 millimeters 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 armored penetration yes and if he 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 will drive faster this is nothing 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.329
 will give so I still could not decide 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 download this branch of the American medium 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.850
 tanks that time I formed not quite 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.120
 correct opinion of these machines but i 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.129
 was wrong yes Pershing is not so good 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.280
 mobility like a classmate in others 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.430
 Nations there is no punch accurate gun high 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 silhouette and the tank in simple words we 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.049
 the most average tank at the level but its 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.420
 queue we have a great review 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 good vertical alignment angles and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.400
 strong tower wait i said towers 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.590
 no more mask guns 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.229
 tower in the cheek area is not difficult 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.720
 punch anyone but there still need 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.880
 get at least the dynamics and is not 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.670
 standards but it is enough to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.740
 take an advantageous position but thanks 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.229
 good stabilization tools 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.299
 nice to implement your dp and how to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.400
 open maps and in urban battles 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.729
 where you need to quickly go to produce 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.610
 shot and quickly roll back the corner what 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.270
 I was still pleased in m26 so it 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.880
 1440 strength points 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.189
 figure for medium tank walk 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.259
 rumors that the m26 pershing is universal 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.299
 tank and I totally agree with that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.549
 feels good here and so 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.530
 supporting the attack of the allied tanks 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.090
 and if the terrain allows it in 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.910
 alone he is able to push through 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.340
 direction playing through the tower in defense 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.590
 the tank is also very good thanks to its 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.140
 review not every enemy tank 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.209
 will get to your base alive in terms of 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.129
 tank modules are also universal but two 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.569
 I consider this module mandatory 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.330
 Vertical Stabilizer and Stabilizer 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.040
 tips the third I chose the improved 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.800
 ventilation can be installed 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.319
 enlightened optics but i tend 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.540
 increase rate of guns 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.700
 from the crew perks and chose the commander you 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.739
 skill sixth sense rest repair 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.290
 second skill I chose martial brotherhood 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.480
 Well, then the choice is yours either 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.030
 maximum review or accuracy would be on 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.540
 go consumables I chose the standard 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.099
 first aid kit little repair kit and fire extinguisher 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.200
 pumping tank sources top I have not 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.900
 caused any problems even in 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.349
 stock condition on machine tools nice 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.810
 play 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.209
 the stock tower allows us to install 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.510
 top guns and turn native 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.340
 chassis withstands top engine 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.080
 in this configuration you will not be 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.470
 labor fill experienced people 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.750
 in the top even playing against the tenths level 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.600
 we can bring a lot of trouble to the enemy 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.490
 piercing piercing shells 268 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.250
 units is enough to punch 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.380
 tyazh forehead yes and shine fishing knows how 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.510
 OK 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.760
 we fight on the map south coast 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.550
 we play against the ninth level and you 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.770
 probably noticed that I play more with 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.320
 stock tower but with a top gun and 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.440
 as I told me my top 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.780
 engine on stock chassis and if you 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.420
 were attentive you probably noticed 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.370
 that food helped our ally 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.490
 push the direction and we have it 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.040
 not bad it turned out I tell you the stock 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.840
 the tower is not particularly critical in terms of 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.600
 rate of fire is quite 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.510
 playable tank turns out even t-44 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.310
 has 1300 units in the top 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.640
 strength points against our 1350 in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.910
 stocking so pershing is very good even in 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.490
 katabatic condition and here we flank 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.060
 broke through we have nothing left to do 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.770
 how to finish off the last enemy here and i 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.220
 I guess, that 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.870
 soon 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.500
 that will already return to base 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.600
 because that flank is completely brought down and 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.090
 if we come all at all to base then 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.240
 I apologize it is not a fact that he 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 there is nobody there at the base and in any way 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.200
 they will shoot down the grip disturb us 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.650
 by all means 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.470
 and as soon as we finished t32 I took for 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.860
 yourself the decision to go and what 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.100
 the sooner the better if 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.610
 superpershing was such mobility then 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.650
 he would not have had a price 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.030
 dull straight for someone but I like him 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.030
 does not count and as you can see tank m26 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.000
 pershing goes well and that is him 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.040
 allows you to safely change direction 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.550
 attacks return to base help on 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.930
 opposite flank allied tanks and 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.800
 I think that the dynamics 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.440
 need more tank medium than armor 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.620
 some kind of stove useless which 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.040
 only cumulative quench but nonetheless 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.040
 these tanks are very good and i changed 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.630
 I fully view this thread before 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.450
 I wanted to get to m46 patton now I 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.280
 already want top patton on tantra 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.400
 sort of so called and as you see 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.480
 here we are already captured 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.700
 enemy tank and of 3 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.260
 didn't notice me i shot it out and 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.110
 calmly drive them through the stone but 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.360
 the problem is that the object itself is 704 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.400
 which should not punch because we 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.920
 not much armor 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.040
 well let's see how it turns out 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.060
 him as you see he got me in the body 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.460
 and did not pierce me and did not even recklessly 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.430
 so 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.520
 armor tank allows you to reflect even 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.569
 shot from top guns of course 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.740
 the object was upset because it arrived 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:24.310
 some fucking 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.440
 m26 and the whole raspberries so to speak I messed up 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.889
 as we could see 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.700
 knocking on each capture 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:35.480
 the enemy of course 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.790
 I had to kill first that is 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.600
 object 704 because it is the most dangerous 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:45.290
 but I was afraid that at any time of 3 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.710
 will turn on me and finish off like this 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.150
 say because at least you can 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.610
 probably think that he is not looking at 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.850
 you kill me from him but at this time he 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.430
 was busy with another pershing super pershing 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.940
 and as you see here 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:05.680
 object 704 is already retreating because it 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.970
 already realized that nothing shines for him 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.940
 of course I shot subscale 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.740
 shells because the object is 704 how are you 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.500
 know cheat and even subcaliber 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.590
 shells I manage we get into the mask 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.480
 guns but that doesn't matter me and this me 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.180
 I say to the fact that when I charge 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.040
 piercing shells it means that I 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.470
 I have no room for error 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.600
 Thank you all for your attention, I hope you 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.160
 it was interesting to subscribe to the channel 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.640
 put your fingers up if you 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.120
 enjoyed with you was athlon 1987 good luck 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.480
 in fights 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.480
 until
