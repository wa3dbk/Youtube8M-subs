another<00:00:00.450> killer<00:00:00.840> planes<00:00:01.260> video

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.000 

you<00:00:14.630> match<00:00:15.020> your<00:00:15.380> plane<00:00:15.740> a<00:00:15.950> lot<00:00:16.220> of<00:00:16.280> prop<00:00:16.610> a<00:00:18.010> lot

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
you match your plane a lot of prop a lot

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.480 
you match your plane a lot of prop a lot
of<00:00:19.130> wing<00:00:19.300> props<00:00:20.300> out<00:00:20.510> of<00:00:20.660> wing<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.770> this<00:00:21.920> is<00:00:22.190> my

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
of wing props out of wing so this is my

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.740 
of wing props out of wing so this is my
maiden<00:00:22.700> flight<00:00:23.029> of<00:00:23.150> this<00:00:23.270> plane

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
maiden flight of this plane

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.560 
maiden flight of this plane
I<00:00:23.779> have<00:00:24.590> not<00:00:24.800> flown<00:00:25.010> it<00:00:25.160> before<00:00:25.490> we<00:00:26.180> made<00:00:26.420> this

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
I have not flown it before we made this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.400 
I have not flown it before we made this
on<00:00:26.779> purpose

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
on purpose

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.240 
on purpose
way<00:00:27.830> over<00:00:28.550> weight<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.150> about<00:00:29.480> 30%<00:00:30.250> heavier

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
way over weight it's about 30% heavier

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.640 
way over weight it's about 30% heavier
than<00:00:32.029> it's<00:00:32.180> supposed<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:32.570> be<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:32.930> forget<00:00:33.590> the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
than it's supposed to be I forget the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.960 
than it's supposed to be I forget the
actual<00:00:34.010> numbers<00:00:34.280> now<00:00:34.460> I'll<00:00:34.610> be<00:00:34.670> able<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.850> see

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
actual numbers now I'll be able to see

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.790 
actual numbers now I'll be able to see
them<00:00:35.090> on<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.300> bottom<00:00:35.420> of<00:00:35.600> screen<00:00:35.720> there<00:00:36.110> so

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
them on the bottom of screen there so

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.220 
them on the bottom of screen there so
this<00:00:37.700> is<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:38.120> response<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.750> all<00:00:38.870> those<00:00:38.989> people

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
this is in response to all those people

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.560 
this is in response to all those people
that<00:00:39.410> say<00:00:39.680> that<00:00:39.760> planes<00:00:40.760> with<00:00:40.910> crash<00:00:41.150> proofing

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
that say that planes with crash proofing

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.790 
that say that planes with crash proofing
are<00:00:41.810> too<00:00:42.590> heavy<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.040> fly<00:00:43.310> nice<00:00:44.230> will<00:00:45.230> show<00:00:45.469> you

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
are too heavy to fly nice will show you

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.200 
are too heavy to fly nice will show you
I<00:00:45.829> haven't<00:00:46.340> even<00:00:46.430> flown<00:00:46.670> this<00:00:46.820> plane<00:00:47.000> but<00:00:47.149> I

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
I haven't even flown this plane but I

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.270 
I haven't even flown this plane but I
have<00:00:47.570> full<00:00:48.140> confidence<00:00:48.469> that<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:48.949> gonna<00:00:49.129> fly

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
have full confidence that it's gonna fly

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.590 
have full confidence that it's gonna fly
like<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.579> rest<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:49.850> these<00:00:49.940> planes<00:00:50.239> do<00:00:50.420> with

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
like the rest of these planes do with

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.450 
like the rest of these planes do with
crash<00:00:50.809> boo<00:00:50.960> phantom<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:51.859> one<00:00:52.010> has<00:00:52.190> max

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
crash boo phantom so this one has max

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.389 
crash boo phantom so this one has max
crash<00:00:52.760> proofing<00:00:53.180> which<00:00:53.359> means<00:00:53.600> tons<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:55.100> rods

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
crash proofing which means tons of rods

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.529 
crash proofing which means tons of rods
making<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.510> plane<00:00:56.750> aerobatic<00:00:57.710> ly<00:00:58.539> muscular

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
making the plane aerobatic ly muscular

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.810 
making the plane aerobatic ly muscular
maybe<00:00:59.809> this<00:01:00.140> stuff<00:01:00.350> is<00:01:00.500> all<00:01:00.769> extremely<00:01:01.519> stiff

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
maybe this stuff is all extremely stiff

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.210 
maybe this stuff is all extremely stiff
I<00:01:02.000> mean<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.140> do<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:03.559> with<00:01:03.829> one<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.070> your

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
I mean can you do this with one of your

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.880 
I mean can you do this with one of your
plane's<00:01:04.550> open<00:01:05.300> you<00:01:05.810> know<00:01:05.900> what<00:01:05.990> I<00:01:06.050> mean<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
plane's open you know what I mean the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.960 
plane's open you know what I mean the
answer<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.250> probably<00:01:07.430> no<00:01:08.350> but<00:01:09.350> um<00:01:09.670> that's<00:01:10.670> what

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
answer is probably no but um that's what

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.760 
answer is probably no but um that's what
these<00:01:11.150> are<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.780> crash<00:01:12.020> true<00:01:12.200> phantoms

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
these are with crash true phantoms

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.510 
these are with crash true phantoms
I'm<00:01:13.520> gonna<00:01:13.670> show<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:13.970> how<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.870> flies<00:01:15.430> here<00:01:16.430> we

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
I'm gonna show you how it flies here we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:38.620 
I'm gonna show you how it flies here we
go<00:01:16.670> maiden<00:01:17.060> flight<00:01:17.299> dynamics<00:01:18.259> txon

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.780 

Oh

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.480 

I<00:01:43.850> think<00:01:44.630> we<00:01:44.750> did<00:01:44.960> not<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.950> prop<00:01:46.160> out<00:01:46.340> of

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
I think we did not the prop out of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.610 
I think we did not the prop out of
balance<00:01:46.760> or<00:01:47.000> diving<00:01:47.540> into<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.080> ground<00:01:48.350> like

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
balance or diving into the ground like

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.840 
balance or diving into the ground like
that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.450 

oh<00:01:55.170> wow<00:01:56.230> just<00:01:56.590> made<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:57.130> now<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.940> would<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.210> it

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
oh wow just made it now that would do it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.550 
oh wow just made it now that would do it
yep<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.150> anyways<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.080> max<00:02:02.320> crash

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
yep so anyways this is the max crash

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.010 
yep so anyways this is the max crash
proofing<00:02:02.979> kit<00:02:03.220> which<00:02:03.460> added<00:02:04.210> some<00:02:04.540> tons<00:02:04.780> of

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
proofing kit which added some tons of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.370 
proofing kit which added some tons of
weight<00:02:05.200> onto<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.910> along<00:02:06.910> with<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.420> roll<00:02:08.170> of

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
weight onto this along with a roll of

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.130 
weight onto this along with a roll of
pennies<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:09.160> added<00:02:10.149> another<00:02:10.570> ton<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.869> weight

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
pennies that added another ton of weight

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.290 
pennies that added another ton of weight
onto<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.220> four<00:02:12.580> thousand<00:02:13.000> two<00:02:13.060> lamp

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
onto it and a four thousand two lamp

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.630 
onto it and a four thousand two lamp
hour<00:02:13.540> battery<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.100> jacked<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
hour battery so we just jacked the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.870 
hour battery so we just jacked the
weight<00:02:15.820> up<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.510> crazy<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.880> and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
weight up on this like crazy and and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.330 
weight up on this like crazy and and
this<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.709> how<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:20.980> flies

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.680 

if<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.520> props<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.120> doubt<00:02:25.239> about<00:02:25.270> that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
if the props a little doubt about that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.660 
if the props a little doubt about that
you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.930> tell<00:02:26.200> from<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.160> way<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.520> flies

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
you can tell from the way that it flies

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.370 
you can tell from the way that it flies
at<00:02:27.880> least<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.390> tell<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.900> does<00:02:29.110> have

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
at least I can tell that it does have

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.440 
at least I can tell that it does have
more<00:02:29.860> weight<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.209> little

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
more weight that it's not just a little

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.770 
more weight that it's not just a little
light<00:02:31.840> claim<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.970> handles<00:02:34.180> differently

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
light claim and it handles differently

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.120 
light claim and it handles differently
and<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.260> happen<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:35.950> claims<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.489> that

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.100 

lies<00:02:45.130> like<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> beef<00:02:46.170> alright<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:49.110> responds

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
lies like a beef alright so and responds

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.089 
lies like a beef alright so and responds
to<00:02:50.230> you're<00:02:50.500> too<00:02:50.800> heavy<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.190> fly<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:52.450> video<00:02:53.099> is

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
to you're too heavy to fly this video is

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.530 
to you're too heavy to fly this video is
an<00:02:55.290> aerobatic<00:02:56.290> thumbing<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.280> nose

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.720 

because<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.590> definitely<00:03:02.980> have<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.400> take<00:03:03.549> out

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
because I definitely have to take out

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.009 
because I definitely have to take out
some<00:03:03.940> of<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> nose<00:03:04.239> weight<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.720> put<00:03:04.930> in

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
some of the nose weight that I put in

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.280 
some of the nose weight that I put in
here<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.690> just<00:03:07.870> wants<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.260> die<00:03:10.110> hmm

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
here it just wants to die hmm

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.820 
here it just wants to die hmm
I<00:03:11.319> put<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.799> 3/4<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.670> roll<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:12.970> pennies<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.569> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
I put in 3/4 of a roll of pennies on the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
I put in 3/4 of a roll of pennies on the
fire<00:03:14.830> wall

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
fire wall

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.910 
fire wall
well<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.720> would<00:03:16.840> be<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.989> fire<00:03:17.200> wall<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.709> little

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
well it would be a fire wall of a little

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.509 
well it would be a fire wall of a little
gas<00:03:18.069> motor<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.360> I<00:03:22.750> think<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.890> want<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.130> take<00:03:24.310> off

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
gas motor so I think I want to take off

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.920 
gas motor so I think I want to take off
a<00:03:24.760> bunch<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.150> them<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.540> trimmed<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:27.780> where<00:03:28.780> it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
a bunch of them I trimmed it to where it

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.470 
a bunch of them I trimmed it to where it
says<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.350> trim<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.850> center<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.390> gravity

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
says to trim it to the center of gravity

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.220 
says to trim it to the center of gravity
and<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.470> think<00:03:32.739> they<00:03:32.920> have<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.250> off<00:03:33.489> as<00:03:34.230> most

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
and I think they have it off as most

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:44.260 
and I think they have it off as most
plane<00:03:35.650> manufacturers<00:03:36.579> somehow<00:03:37.390> seem<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.930> do

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.540 

but<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.080> actually<00:03:45.350> now<00:03:45.740> this<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.100> free<00:03:46.370> cell

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
but I actually now this is a free cell

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.400 
but I actually now this is a free cell
battery<00:03:46.910> once<00:03:47.120> again<00:03:47.390> by<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.630> way<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:47.930> this

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
battery once again by the way so this

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.280 
battery once again by the way so this
plane<00:03:49.130> performs<00:03:49.640> very<00:03:49.970> nicely<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.990> free

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
plane performs very nicely on a free

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:02.530 
plane performs very nicely on a free
cell<00:03:59.110> and<00:04:00.110> it's<00:04:00.320> very<00:04:00.560> crisp<00:04:00.890> handling<00:04:01.460> so<00:04:01.790> you

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
cell and it's very crisp handling so you

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.340 
cell and it's very crisp handling so you
know<00:04:02.660> when<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.870> move<00:04:03.530> my<00:04:03.740> wings<00:04:03.950> like<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.400> well

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
know when I move my wings like that well

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.630 
know when I move my wings like that well
just<00:04:06.350> doesn't<00:04:06.530> have<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.680> little<00:04:06.890> bounce<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.340> it

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
just doesn't have a little bounce to it

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.430 
just doesn't have a little bounce to it
actually<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:08.210> goes<00:04:08.360> back<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.840> forth<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:09.290> one

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
actually it goes back and forth on one

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.620 
actually it goes back and forth on one
little<00:04:09.560> see<00:04:09.800> if<00:04:09.920> when<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:11.030> although<00:04:11.330> it's

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
little see if when I it although it's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.750 
little see if when I it although it's
crisp<00:04:11.990> it<00:04:12.200> bounces<00:04:12.800> when<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.160> gets<00:04:13.340> there<00:04:13.580> but

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
crisp it bounces when it gets there but

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.490 
crisp it bounces when it gets there but
isn't<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> little<00:04:14.180> breezy<00:04:14.600> right<00:04:14.720> now<00:04:14.870> -<00:04:14.930> no

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
isn't it a little breezy right now - no

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.750 
isn't it a little breezy right now - no
I<00:04:15.530> think<00:04:15.680> that's<00:04:15.950> just<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.250> plane<00:04:16.520> doing<00:04:16.760> it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
I think that's just the plane doing it

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.680 
I think that's just the plane doing it
see<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:19.940> see<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.480> way<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.750> bounces<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:23.570> is

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
see that see the way it bounces this is

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.510 
see that see the way it bounces this is
half<00:04:23.930> half<00:04:24.440> bottle<00:04:26.890> fly<00:04:27.890> that<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.280> full

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
half half bottle fly that on full

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:40.200 
half half bottle fly that on full
throttle<00:04:30.190> flip<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.460> dive

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.460 

lies<00:04:41.210> rather<00:04:41.660> nicely<00:04:42.470> for<00:04:43.040> my<00:04:43.190> taste

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.170 

all<00:04:48.470> right

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
all right

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.990 
all right
I'm<00:04:50.180> over<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.630> runway<00:04:50.990> Steve<00:04:51.850> would<00:04:52.850> be<00:04:52.970> a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
I'm over the runway Steve would be a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:34.629 
I'm over the runway Steve would be a
good<00:04:53.150> idea

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.750 

hmm

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.820 

you
