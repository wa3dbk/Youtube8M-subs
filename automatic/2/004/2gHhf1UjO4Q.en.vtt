00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.230
 what milan have gone as you have 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.030
 could also be noticed on the series at all 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 the last few days they think they are doing 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 the business of life and therefore of 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 a consequence of guilt many times over 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.619
 of prosecutors 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.170
 this must be said or because the use 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.710
 of the players and therefore automatically 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.619
 we had a bit so do some 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.160
 time, however, all is well what 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.200
 ends well us this speech which 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.350
 we had started long ago 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
 along with other negotiations that some 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.540
 letters also called some networks 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 wrong but still there 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 I would like to add that we do not have 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 made a shot he made two because 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.949
 however we do n't forget that they fly 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 because they also wanted temple to be one 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 bet above all off and on of soiano 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.850
 I believe that if it comes as I have it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.860
 spoken and how I saw it done 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.580
 workout I believe we try one 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 another beautiful piece 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.830
 so cacia and bojinov are players 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.570
 of the verona 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 we also say that you have tried to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.670
 last to arrive at nando sforzini 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.650
 there was the last meeting today at 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.530
 few hours after the market closes but 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.110
 as we could already guess 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.110
 yesterday the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.030
 the grosseto absolutely did not want 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 file your claims and then you have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 then diverted to another first 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 we remember the goal he said it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 she too is not my president anyway 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.260
 I never said 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.210
 the first choice and this is the first 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.030
 choice we had two or three intention 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.430
 of speeches made with the coach and in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 also a function of how to create 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.250
 the staff because we don't 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.170
 we forget that we took a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 boy bought a boy is called 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 coconut that unfortunately got hurt but 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.650
 which has very similar characteristics and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.590
 endeavor then happiness header 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.000
 I mean today we believe that 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.800
 science knows it has done technically 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.100
 this thing here because we have many 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.530
 many more solutions than to have 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.209
 so we only have sforzini 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.770
 we need motivated people we want one 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.989
 motivated team team called in 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.390
 I call every Saturday as if it were 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.590
 a final so I guess if that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.070
 let's say mix between technique and determination will come 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.500
 out 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.190
 well then what could we also say 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.400
 us ours 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.030
 here you explain us stories then we leave 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.830
 go know that even a long list of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.600
 suitors who want to contact you 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.910
 but I wanted to ask this 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.459
 the bielanovic situation and yes they are 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.290
 he ran after news in Milan, he says 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.540
 alvarez and then milan via the citadel e 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.430
 then for 30 seconds 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.230
 the vice Milan contract was not 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.580
 filed it went so he recommended 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.100
 exactly I was no longer there so not 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.760
 I know exactly I know, but in short, it is 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.640
 the basic problem you enter that 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.519
 of the time I do not know why the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.100
 people can not be suspected that is today 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.590
 with much regret but we will find one 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.330
 Also solution to the budget and he can not 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.630
 be on the list then automatically 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.760
 a location to be found in 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.320
 teams where they can still do market 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.320
 having said that, that said 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.860
 I am against the last second 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.379
 of the last day, however, evidently 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.239
 this event of Italian football yes 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.079
 he thought of doing business I don't know but him 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.280
 business you do on the programs will be 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.939
 president only one curiosity 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.409
 since I think it was the market 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.359
 of the most important verona of the last 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.220
 twenty years because I really don't have 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.650
 memories of a market of the genius of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.890
 verona with a verona master of the market 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.019
 and throughout the whole market because 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.049
 in short, because even today the last blow 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.989
 it is cacia and it is really true 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.049
 very much is the market she wanted 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.950
 that she expected when she took the 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.599
 verona and market that I within myself 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.519
 I knew what I wanted to do what I wanted to do 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.260
 what we have to do but I repeat is not that 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.620
 have done that we are not the manchester 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.169
 city ​​we are the verona with all his 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.150
 qualities defects with all of the people who 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.800
 he works 20 hours a day that he has so much 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.139
 desire to do well for the passion of 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.270
 this dirt dictates the pressure that i 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.820
 fans put us in pursuit and of 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.550
 give us love and hope this 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.770
 give another hand to give another 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.419
 subscribers that already are we did the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.130
 records but that can still increase 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.599
 since in any case there is the possibility of 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.659
 do them again and I take nothing from them 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.199
 season ticket campaign so yes 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.120
 the season ticket campaign will continue 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.909
 distance has already been established 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.900
 that went on until it seems to me after the 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:03.050
 queen then to say this goes on 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.000
 of justifying of us I believe that when I 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.010
 I decided on this adventure 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.440
 the origin on the basis of cola so much 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.150
 experience and that I could have acquired 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.070
 but above all with the desire to do 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.830
 football in a certain way 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.810
 I think in people I repeat not 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.870
 they get tired of saying it at a corporate level 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.789
 which I took and to do a homework 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.710
 team there are a number of components 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.310
 that I was hoping for the Bossi justice 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.919
 we went maybe even beyond 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.419
 forecasts and now we hope that everything 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.960
 the rest make things work so 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.960
 the ultràs
