00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.950
 which areas should expect more rain 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.200
 which areas should expect less rain 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 Over the next 15 days staff 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 You can see people who in areas 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 the northern region of Brazil in areas of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 northeastern north coast 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 we must have large volumes of rain 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 accumulated in this period even by 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.609
 account of the presence of the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 intertropical convergence east 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.789
 Northeastern Brazil is already beginning to have a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.890
 of little rain 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.080
 We must have this rain there. 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 front brake during that week and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 then a condition of the atmosphere 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.320
 re-drying the predominance of a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.270
 mass of air that is warmer and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 as in areas of general mines 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.770
 santo rio de janeiro in são paulo and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 I still must have some rain showers 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 different from what I have in areas of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.890
 south of Brazil where the predominance still 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.870
 will be from drier air until the 13th 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 April we should expect a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 low rainfall conditions over 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 center of southern Brazil indicating the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 presence of a mass of drier air 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.640
 and if we look here in São Paulo 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.799
 we should have it in volumes of rain 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 which hardly reach 30 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.340
 millimeters accumulated in the period 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.350
 in these shades of orange as well as in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 minefields of rio de janeiro and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 also of the holy spirit in the south 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 brazil also the predominance will be of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.680
 a little rain until the 18th, what we should 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 expect a still fairly dry condition 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 about areas of south-central Brazil 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 little rain on the mine region 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.869
 general sao paulo region of rio de janeiro 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 January holy spirit and the whole region 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.820
 south of Brazil as well as in areas 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.100
 in the region of mato grosso do sul the region 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.380
 beyond northern mato grosso do sul should 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 have a more favorable condition to rain 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.729
 accumulated still order of 70 mm 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 in these yellowish tones 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.750
 I still have a lot of rain expected 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.220
 on areas of mato grosso over areas 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 west of goiás 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.810
 but brasília federal district already promises 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 be a condition of little rain along 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.619
 of this period we already have the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.090
 predominance of those orange tones that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.040
 They indicate to us or rain in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.270
 maximum reaches 30 millimeters 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.270
 accumulated over the period
