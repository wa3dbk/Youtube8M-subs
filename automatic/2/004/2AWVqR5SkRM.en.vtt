here not they joined no sort of spring
mechanism<00:01:29.090> just<00:01:29.660> plastic<00:01:30.590> that's<00:01:30.860> angle<00:01:31.310> to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
mechanism just plastic that's angle to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.600 
mechanism just plastic that's angle to
go<00:01:31.580> quite<00:01:31.910> tightly<00:01:32.810> together<00:01:33.200> have<00:01:33.980> to<00:01:34.130> get<00:01:34.310> a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
go quite tightly together have to get a

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.940 
go quite tightly together have to get a
fair<00:01:35.330> old<00:01:35.510> snap<00:01:35.810> on<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.050> padded<00:01:36.560> on<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.800> back

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
it click it straight on to the peak

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.140 
it click it straight on to the peak
there<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:48.379> you<00:03:48.470> know<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:49.150> obviously

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
there and you know what obviously

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.670 
there and you know what obviously
because<00:03:50.329> this<00:03:50.419> is<00:03:50.569> solid<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.109> very<00:03:51.319> smooth

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
because this is solid and very smooth

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.610 
because this is solid and very smooth
it's<00:03:51.949> not<00:03:52.159> jammed<00:03:52.959> solidly<00:03:53.959> on<00:03:54.079> there<00:03:54.319> but

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
it's not jammed solidly on there but

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.640 
it's not jammed solidly on there but
that's<00:03:54.979> pretty<00:03:55.489> tight<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:56.840> have<00:03:57.109> to<00:03:57.290> really

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's pretty tight don't have to really

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.009 
that's pretty tight don't have to really
sort<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.889> shake<00:03:58.220> my<00:03:58.459> head<00:03:58.729> and<00:03:58.879> wiggle<00:03:59.750> about

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
sort of shake my head and wiggle about

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.379 
sort of shake my head and wiggle about
to<00:04:00.229> get<00:04:00.379> that<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.680> come<00:04:00.859> off<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:01.790> obviously

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
to get that to come off but obviously

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.879 
to get that to come off but obviously
the<00:04:02.780> intention<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.409> that<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.739> would<00:04:03.859> be

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889

wearing that on a wooly hat or on
something<00:04:06.889> like<00:04:07.159> this<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.669> sort<00:04:07.849> of

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
something like this that sort of

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.020 
something like this that sort of
strapped<00:04:08.359> around<00:04:08.510> your<00:04:08.810> head<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:08.989> suppose

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
strapped around your head I suppose

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.280 
strapped around your head I suppose
where<00:04:11.030> it's<00:04:11.269> not<00:04:11.509> going<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.840> be<00:04:11.930> having<00:04:12.139> that

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
where it's not going to be having that

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.770 
where it's not going to be having that
sort<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.739> motion<00:04:12.919> and<00:04:13.430> it's<00:04:14.239> obviously<00:04:14.599> gonna

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
sort of motion and it's obviously gonna

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.120 
sort of motion and it's obviously gonna
be<00:04:14.900> on<00:04:15.199> something<00:04:16.099> if<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.579> can<00:04:17.859> something<00:04:18.859> more

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
be on something if I can something more

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.510 
be on something if I can something more
like<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.639> that's<00:04:20.030> soft<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.219> I'm<00:04:22.219> assuming

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
like this that's soft and I'm assuming

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.640 
like this that's soft and I'm assuming
that<00:04:22.880> once<00:04:23.090> that's<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:23.810> it's<00:04:24.200> all<00:04:24.349> tight

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
that once that's on and it's all tight

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.170 
that once that's on and it's all tight
around<00:04:24.800> your<00:04:25.039> head<00:04:25.279> that's<00:04:25.580> going<00:04:25.849> to<00:04:25.909> be<00:04:26.000> nice

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
around your head that's going to be nice

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.180 
around your head that's going to be nice
and<00:04:26.539> solid<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.169> place

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
and solid in place

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.460 
and solid in place
it's<00:04:28.430> something<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.240> say<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:30.110> doesn't

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
it's something that I say it doesn't

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.100 
it's something that I say it doesn't
look<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:31.040> off<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.760> can<00:04:31.940> do<00:04:32.270> extreme

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
look like it off you can do extreme

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.710 
look like it off you can do extreme
extreme<00:04:33.770> bumpy<00:04:34.400> sort<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.790> filming<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
extreme bumpy sort of filming and

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.240 
extreme bumpy sort of filming and
anything<00:04:36.440> that's<00:04:36.590> gonna<00:04:36.740> have<00:04:36.890> too<00:04:37.040> much

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
anything that's gonna have too much

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.040 
anything that's gonna have too much
motion<00:04:37.460> but<00:04:37.850> that's<00:04:38.300> just<00:04:38.450> something<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.930> very

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
motion but that's just something a very

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.380 
motion but that's just something a very
simple<00:04:39.500> way<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:39.650> example<00:04:40.340> me<00:04:40.520> going<00:04:41.120> out<00:04:41.240> on

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
simple way for example me going out on

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.390 
simple way for example me going out on
the<00:04:41.510> kayak<00:04:41.900> like<00:04:42.140> ever<00:04:42.350> right<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.770> something

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
the kayak like ever right to something

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.280 
the kayak like ever right to something
like<00:04:43.640> that<00:04:43.880> on<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.240> front<00:04:44.420> of<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.570> wooly<00:04:44.750> hat

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
like that on the front of a wooly hat

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.920 
like that on the front of a wooly hat
I<00:04:45.320> mean<00:04:45.770> if<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.130> was<00:04:46.280> on<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.610> canal<00:04:46.910> kayaking<00:04:47.660> in

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
I mean if I was on the canal kayaking in

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.690 
I mean if I was on the canal kayaking in
such<00:04:48.110> extreme<00:04:48.560> conditions<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:49.250> this<00:04:49.400> came

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
such extreme conditions that this came

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.240 
such extreme conditions that this came
off<00:04:49.730> then<00:04:50.420> I<00:04:50.660> think<00:04:51.020> that<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.560> GoPro<00:04:51.950> would<00:04:52.100> be

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
off then I think that the GoPro would be

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.330 
off then I think that the GoPro would be
the<00:04:52.460> last<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:53.030> my<00:04:53.210> problems<00:04:54.130> anyway

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
the last of my problems anyway

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.680 
the last of my problems anyway
