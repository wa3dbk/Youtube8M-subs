00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.500
 Hello, how are I, and Jose Luis, and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.720
 today I am going to share a 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 extraordinary UFO that we capture does 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.170
 a lot of time alone that we had not 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.110
 uploaded we had it reserved for a 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:37.370
 special video this object we capture 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.489
 on December 18, 2013 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 we get that object with the juke with 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.620
 rangers we did not see it only we saw that 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.829
 an elongated object was going like rotating 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.370
 on an axis we do not really know that 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:01.270
 It was this object but if it was very 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.530
 awesome because the object 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.820
 it moved invisibly and the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.030
 night 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.150
 when I was planning the sky 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:18.350
 I was locating objects in the sky 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.240
 This object appears suddenly and without 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.979
 I saw it because I was trying 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.160
 locate it in the sky 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.950
 I really did not see it but if I did it 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.740
 qatar with the yukon rangers and only 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.080
 had that reference because only 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.330
 by means of liu with this image I the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.869
 was going to the computer that's why 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.820
 was that I'm showing you but 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.910
 directly or physically this object 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.729
 I did not see it and if the studies thought 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.289
 the same way because that's how it was like 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.200
 happened that's why I'm 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.270
 putting this video right now because 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.880
 from my point of view this video was 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.280
 makes it truly incredible by all 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.070
 conditions for all conditions in 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.409
 that was given that good sighting this 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.509
 video 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.769
 I had stopped to be able to 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.720
 publish it because it was very 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:14.379
 awesome I do not know what is the truth 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.830
 and apart from that it is invisible 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.590
 at first sight and at night you could not 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.080
 Seeing me also makes me very 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.069
 I miss that directly in the yukon it 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.180
 I could be seeing but the object 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.400
 physically at night I did not see it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.769
 here is going to get where is 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.079
 good is going to hide on the part of 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.819
 behind one of the light poles that 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.980
 I have in front of the house see and it's already 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.150
 on the back of those posts 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.450
 but this object really really that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.900
 it was very strange because physically I did not 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.569
 saw 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.239
 and there it appears again and this one goes to 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.099
 lose after by the back 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.079
 of any of the trees that are 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.079
 find more towards the bottom 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.340
 you see the stars you see this also 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.700
 the light wires really it was a 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.920
 object very but very strange good I am 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.220
 jose luis rolls and until the next we 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.220
