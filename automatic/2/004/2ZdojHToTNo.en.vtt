00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
...if not, cut it to prevent longitudinal tears

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.700
Measure the laminate according to the length to be reinforced

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
If it is cut with scissors, protect the cutting area to prevent tearing

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000

Recommendations
Sika® Carbodur®

00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:01.500
An engineer with the proper training must be responsible for the reinforcement design.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:01.500
This application is structural, therefore, special care in selecting specialized and experienced applicators must be taken. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.500
Consult most current local Product Data Sheet prior to any use.
