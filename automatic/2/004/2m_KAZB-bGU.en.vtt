00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
all right this is Vegeta 8259 and this

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.470 
all right this is Vegeta 8259 and this
is<00:00:03.810> part<00:00:04.170> two<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.520> master<00:00:05.759> grade<00:00:06.180> wing

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
is part two of the master grade wing

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.740 
is part two of the master grade wing
done<00:00:06.690> number<00:00:06.990> view<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.790> usually<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
done number view and I usually do the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.990 
done number view and I usually do the
inner<00:00:10.200> frame<00:00:10.590> portion<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.429> review<00:00:11.610> last

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
inner frame portion of the review last

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.089 
inner frame portion of the review last
but<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.780> think<00:00:13.139> I'm<00:00:13.259> gonna<00:00:13.349> go<00:00:13.530> ahead<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:13.950> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
but I think I'm gonna go ahead and do it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.980 
but I think I'm gonna go ahead and do it
in<00:00:14.280> part<00:00:14.790> two<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.420> video

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
in part two for this video

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.540 
in part two for this video
now<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> servi<00:00:17.100> rather<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.650> wing

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
now for the servi rather so this is wing

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
now for the servi rather so this is wing
Gundams<00:00:21.029> inner<00:00:21.390> frame<00:00:23.750> again<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
Gundams inner frame again just like the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.189 
Gundams inner frame again just like the
outer<00:00:25.470> armor<00:00:25.949> I've<00:00:26.130> painted<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.330> even

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
outer armor I've painted all this even

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.160 
outer armor I've painted all this even
done<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> detail<00:00:30.000> work<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:31.050> it's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
done a little bit of detail work so it's

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.160 
done a little bit of detail work so it's
not<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.489> gunmetal<00:00:32.910> color<00:00:34.130> I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
not all just this one gunmetal color I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.060 
not all just this one gunmetal color I
like<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.739> fact<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.989> even<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.350> shield<00:00:40.770> has

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
like the fact that even the shield has

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.280 
like the fact that even the shield has
kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.940> guess<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.629> could<00:00:42.780> call<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.170> an

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
kind of a I guess you could call it an

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.369 
kind of a I guess you could call it an
inner<00:00:43.440> frame<00:00:44.270> basically<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.690> consisting<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
inner frame basically just consisting of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590 
inner frame basically just consisting of
the<00:00:46.590> spine<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.670> runs<00:00:47.850> down<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> center<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the spine that runs down the center of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.700 
the spine that runs down the center of
the<00:00:48.780> shield<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.430> even<00:00:50.430> still<00:00:51.059> has<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the shield and even still has the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.080 
the shield and even still has the
up-and-down<00:00:52.710> motion<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.430> opening<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
up-and-down motion for opening the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.779 
up-and-down motion for opening the
shield<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> thought<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> was<00:00:56.250> actually<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
shield so I thought that was actually a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.720 
shield so I thought that was actually a
nice<00:00:56.969> touch<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.510> can't<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.399> don't<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.460> there's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
nice touch I can't I don't know there's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
nice touch I can't I don't know there's
there<00:00:59.969> might<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> can't

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there might be one out there but I can't

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.979 
there might be one out there but I can't
think<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> another<00:01:01.770> master<00:01:02.190> grade<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> has<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
think of another master grade that has a

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
think of another master grade that has a
inner<00:01:03.989> frame<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> shield<00:01:04.890> again<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
inner frame of the shield again if you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.490 
inner frame of the shield again if you
could<00:01:06.090> even<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.840> call<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.320> inner

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
could even really call that an inner

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
could even really call that an inner
frame<00:01:08.270> um<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.860> like<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.189> fact<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> wings

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
frame um I like the fact that the wings

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
frame um I like the fact that the wings
also<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.960> inner<00:01:13.140> frame<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.640> an

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
also have an inner frame as well well an

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.899 
also have an inner frame as well well an
inner<00:01:15.060> frame<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.509> sorts<00:01:16.430> even<00:01:17.430> though<00:01:17.729> they

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
inner frame of sorts even though they

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
inner frame of sorts even though they
are<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.090> kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:19.320> nubs<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.100> they

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
are just kind of little nubs but they

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.289 
are just kind of little nubs but they
still<00:01:20.790> look<00:01:21.000> pretty<00:01:21.030> cool<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.909> part

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
still look pretty cool I think this part

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.929 
still look pretty cool I think this part
right<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.740> been<00:01:25.799> white<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
right here would have been white if you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.390 
right here would have been white if you
just<00:01:27.530> snap<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> kit<00:01:28.860> together<00:01:29.130> without

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just snap the kit together without

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.780 
just snap the kit together without
painting<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.840> since<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.520> modified<00:01:32.520> my

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
painting it but since I modified my

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
painting it but since I modified my
wings<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.509> cut<00:01:33.659> those<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:34.159> white<00:01:35.159> fins

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
wings and cut those little white fins

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
wings and cut those little white fins
off<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.659> went<00:01:36.840> ahead<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.049> painted<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
off I just went ahead and painted this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830 
off I just went ahead and painted this
the<00:01:38.460> gunmetal<00:01:38.790> color<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> used<00:01:39.689> on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the gunmetal color that I used on

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.580 
the gunmetal color that I used on
everything<00:01:40.200> else<00:01:40.820> plus<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.259> having<00:01:43.259> just

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
everything else plus I think having just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.749 
everything else plus I think having just
the<00:01:43.710> inner<00:01:43.860> frame<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.670> have

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the inner frame here this would have

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.859 
the inner frame here this would have
looked<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> awkward<00:01:45.450> being<00:01:45.630> white

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
looked kind of awkward being white

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.340 
looked kind of awkward being white
anyway<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:50.329> actually<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
anyway so I actually really like this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.630 
anyway so I actually really like this
inner<00:01:52.530> frame<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.579> small<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:55.640> it's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
inner frame it is kind of small but it's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.780 
inner frame it is kind of small but it's
not<00:01:56.969> nearly<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.689> fragile<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.710> victory<00:01:59.549> gonna

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
not nearly as fragile as victory gonna

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.609 
not nearly as fragile as victory gonna
mess<00:01:59.969> inner<00:02:00.149> frame<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.689> fact<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.140> pretty

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
mess inner frame in fact it's pretty

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.429 
mess inner frame in fact it's pretty
sturdy<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.399> mean<00:02:03.240> give<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> shake<00:02:04.140> test

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
sturdy I mean give it the shake test

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
sturdy I mean give it the shake test
like<00:02:05.040> Robert<00:02:06.000> does<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.030> really

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
like Robert does and it's really really

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.760 
like Robert does and it's really really
sturdy<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.259> anywhere

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
sturdy it's not going anywhere

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.540 
sturdy it's not going anywhere

don't have my little hero you a figure
in<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.770> at<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.070> moment<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.800> uh<00:02:22.450> yeah<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
in there at the moment but uh yeah the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.620 
in there at the moment but uh yeah the
head<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.770> actually<00:02:25.220> really<00:02:25.550> really<00:02:25.970> small<00:02:26.300> on

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
head is actually really really small on

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.630 
head is actually really really small on
the<00:02:26.900> inner<00:02:27.050> frame<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.620> almost<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.190> one

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
the inner frame it's almost like one

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.140 
the inner frame it's almost like one
tu-144<00:02:29.360> scale<00:02:29.630> size<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.580> don't<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.910> really

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
tu-144 scale size you don't get really

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.730 
tu-144 scale size you don't get really
getting<00:02:32.450> any<00:02:32.540> inner<00:02:32.810> frame<00:02:33.170> parts<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
getting any inner frame parts for the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.420 
getting any inner frame parts for the
faceplate<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:34.880> you've<00:02:35.870> got<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.260> big<00:02:37.070> clear

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
faceplate but you've got the big clear

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.960 
faceplate but you've got the big clear
part<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.510> most<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.740> front<00:02:40.280> part<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.850> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
part this most of this front part of the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.970 
part this most of this front part of the
head<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.330> gonna<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.660> yellow<00:02:42.020> for<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.500> yellow

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
head is gonna be yellow for the yellow

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.260 
head is gonna be yellow for the yellow
head<00:02:43.160> Wilkins<00:02:43.550> but<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.820> went<00:02:44.000> ahead<00:02:44.120> and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
head Wilkins but I went ahead and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.900 
head Wilkins but I went ahead and
painted<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.840> gunmetal<00:02:45.290> color<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.920> then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
painted it this gunmetal color and then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.870 
painted it this gunmetal color and then
just<00:02:47.180> painted<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> yellow<00:02:48.710> head<00:02:48.920> Vulcans<00:02:49.340> by

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
just painted the yellow head Vulcans by

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.780 
just painted the yellow head Vulcans by
hand<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:52.070> make<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.310> look<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.520> little<00:02:52.610> bit

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
hand just to make it look a little bit

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.050 
hand just to make it look a little bit
nicer<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:54.010> then<00:02:55.930> everything<00:02:56.930> else<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:58.060> pretty

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
nicer and then everything else is pretty

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.970 
nicer and then everything else is pretty
much<00:02:59.240> all<00:02:59.540> gonna<00:03:00.020> be<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.410> gunmetal<00:03:00.830> color

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
much all gonna be that gunmetal color

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.330 
much all gonna be that gunmetal color
and<00:03:01.490> then<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.750> went<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.470> added<00:03:03.890> some<00:03:04.070> little

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
and then I went in and added some little

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.090 
and then I went in and added some little
copper<00:03:04.730> details<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.660> then<00:03:05.870> went<00:03:06.740> in<00:03:06.860> with

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
copper details and then went in with

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.070 
copper details and then went in with
some<00:03:07.400> solid<00:03:07.820> colors<00:03:08.300> like<00:03:08.480> red<00:03:08.690> yellow<00:03:08.960> and

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
some solid colors like red yellow and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.180 
some solid colors like red yellow and
blue<00:03:10.420> added<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.480> few<00:03:11.690> silver<00:03:11.930> details<00:03:12.410> like<00:03:12.710> the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
blue added a few silver details like the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.990 
blue added a few silver details like the
undersides<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.140> thrusters<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> feet

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
undersides of the thrusters on the feet

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.380 
undersides of the thrusters on the feet
thrusters<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.240> back<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.600> legs<00:03:19.390> and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
thrusters on the back of the legs and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.020 
thrusters on the back of the legs and
just<00:03:20.870> did<00:03:21.140> some<00:03:21.410> little<00:03:22.130> detail<00:03:22.550> work<00:03:22.790> not

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
just did some little detail work not

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.300 
just did some little detail work not
really<00:03:25.390> going<00:03:26.390> for<00:03:27.020> any<00:03:27.290> specific<00:03:27.980> pattern

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
really going for any specific pattern

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.730 
really going for any specific pattern
and<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.460> was<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.760> kind<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:28.970> randomly<00:03:29.740> filling

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
and I was just kind of randomly filling

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.190 
and I was just kind of randomly filling
in<00:03:30.860> details<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.870> wouldn't<00:03:33.140> all

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
in details here just so it wouldn't all

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.800 
in details here just so it wouldn't all
be<00:03:33.230> one<00:03:33.590> color<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:36.790> it's<00:03:37.790> actually<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.390> pretty

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
be one color and it's actually a pretty

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.440 
be one color and it's actually a pretty
good<00:03:39.160> representation<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.970> Wing<00:03:41.150> Dunham

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
good representation of the Wing Dunham

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.330 
good representation of the Wing Dunham
because<00:03:41.690> there's<00:03:42.440> nothing<00:03:42.710> missing<00:03:43.190> you've

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
because there's nothing missing you've

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.600 
because there's nothing missing you've
even<00:03:43.490> got<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.820> skirt<00:03:44.600> Armour<00:03:44.990> here<00:03:45.350> on<00:03:45.610> front

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
even got the skirt Armour here on front

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.290 
even got the skirt Armour here on front
sides<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.360> back<00:03:47.780> skirts<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.760> wings<00:03:50.000> are

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
sides and back skirts the wings are

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.190 
sides and back skirts the wings are
there<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.750> said<00:03:50.780> earlier<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.940> very<00:03:53.200> 2.0

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
there like I said earlier it's very 2.0

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.320 
there like I said earlier it's very 2.0
ish<00:03:55.810> maybe<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:57.200> quite<00:03:57.560> as<00:03:57.950> good<00:03:58.190> as<00:03:58.460> your

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
ish maybe not quite as good as your

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.860 
ish maybe not quite as good as your
average<00:03:59.540> 2.0<00:04:00.350> frame<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:01.820> still<00:04:02.300> think<00:04:02.540> that<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
average 2.0 frame I still think that the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.890 
average 2.0 frame I still think that the
you<00:04:03.260> know<00:04:03.380> Zaku<00:04:03.890> 2.0<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:04.760> gundam<00:04:05.090> 2.0<00:04:05.630> have

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
you know Zaku 2.0 and gundam 2.0 have

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.000 
you know Zaku 2.0 and gundam 2.0 have
better<00:04:06.860> inner<00:04:07.130> frames<00:04:07.490> than<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.570> but<00:04:09.110> this

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
better inner frames than this but this

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.470 
better inner frames than this but this
is<00:04:10.190> still<00:04:10.400> pretty<00:04:10.460> nice<00:04:13.000> I'm<00:04:14.000> seeing<00:04:14.240> us<00:04:14.360> on

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
is still pretty nice I'm seeing us on

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.750 
is still pretty nice I'm seeing us on
the<00:04:14.570> last<00:04:14.750> master<00:04:15.110> grade<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.410> got<00:04:15.680> was<00:04:15.920> victory

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
the last master grade I got was victory

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.360 
the last master grade I got was victory
Gundam<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.960> is<00:04:18.109> definitely<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.799> welcome

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
Gundam this is definitely a welcome

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.960 
Gundam this is definitely a welcome
change<00:04:19.880> in<00:04:20.299> quality<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:22.070> just<00:04:22.490> don't<00:04:22.669> know<00:04:22.790> what

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
change in quality I just don't know what

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.580 
change in quality I just don't know what
went<00:04:23.150> wrong<00:04:23.240> with<00:04:23.479> that<00:04:23.600> kit

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
went wrong with that kit

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.939 
went wrong with that kit
but<00:04:25.370> anyway<00:04:26.020> articulation<00:04:27.020> for<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.770> inner

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
but anyway articulation for the inner

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.800 
but anyway articulation for the inner
frame<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.550> pretty<00:04:28.760> much<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.240> same<00:04:29.449> as<00:04:29.660> it<00:04:29.780> is

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
frame is pretty much the same as it is

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.000 
frame is pretty much the same as it is
on<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.470> with<00:04:31.400> all<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.790> armor<00:04:32.210> attached<00:04:33.010> so

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
on the with all the armor attached so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.560 
on the with all the armor attached so
I'm<00:04:34.430> not<00:04:34.639> gonna<00:04:34.729> bother<00:04:34.910> going<00:04:35.180> over

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
I'm not gonna bother going over

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.159 
I'm not gonna bother going over
articulation<00:04:36.290> with<00:04:36.440> this<00:04:36.650> because<00:04:37.960> I'll<00:04:38.960> just

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
articulation with this because I'll just

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.780 
articulation with this because I'll just
be<00:04:39.320> repeating<00:04:39.710> myself<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:42.639> guess<00:04:43.639> that's

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
be repeating myself so I guess that's

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.120 
be repeating myself so I guess that's
about<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.389> I<00:04:44.720> really<00:04:45.199> hate<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.410> drag<00:04:45.710> out<00:04:45.919> these

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
about it I really hate to drag out these

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.230 
about it I really hate to drag out these
inner<00:04:46.729> frame<00:04:47.060> reviews<00:04:47.600> very<00:04:48.410> long<00:04:48.650> because

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
inner frame reviews very long because

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.070 
inner frame reviews very long because
there's<00:04:50.240> not<00:04:50.360> really<00:04:50.540> much<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.780> go<00:04:51.020> over<00:04:52.600> so<00:04:53.600> I

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
there's not really much to go over so I

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.659 
there's not really much to go over so I
think<00:04:54.620> I'm<00:04:54.740> gonna<00:04:54.830> go<00:04:55.040> ahead<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.340> end<00:04:55.490> this

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
think I'm gonna go ahead and end this

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.370 
think I'm gonna go ahead and end this
