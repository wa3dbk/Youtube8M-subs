open what we need to do we need to go to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320 
open what we need to do we need to go to
file<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> new<00:01:05.700> screen

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
file and we need to go to new screen

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
file and we need to go to new screen
recording<00:01:08.299> now<00:01:09.439> we<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.159> it's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
recording now we can see here that it's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.880 
recording now we can see here that it's
picking<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.510> audio<00:01:12.810> already<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.680> that's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
picking up the audio already so that's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.390 
picking up the audio already so that's
good

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
good

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.789 
good
however<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:15.119> default<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> usually<00:01:16.380> off

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
however by default this is usually off

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
however by default this is usually off
it's<00:01:17.220> usually<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> none<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> means

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it's usually set to none so that means

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's usually set to none so that means
that<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:19.890> record<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> screen<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that it will record the screen but it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
that it will record the screen but it
actually<00:01:21.000> won't<00:01:21.240> record<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.720> audio<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.229> one

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
actually won't record you audio so one

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
actually won't record you audio so one
thing<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> make<00:01:23.100> sure<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
thing you need to make sure is that you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480
