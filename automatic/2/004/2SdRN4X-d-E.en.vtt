00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
staying to the north of us that's all

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.029 
staying to the north of us that's all
associated<00:00:19.020> with<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> leading<00:00:19.500> edge<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.920> the

but<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.560> picture<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:32.040> hopefully<00:00:32.189> change

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
but this picture will hopefully change

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.880 
but this picture will hopefully change
because<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.420> need<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.899> rain<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.710> now

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

some scattered showers just popping up

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
some scattered showers just popping up
towards<00:00:37.110> Vero<00:00:37.380> Beach<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.010> south<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
towards Vero Beach in just south of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
towards Vero Beach in just south of
Orlando<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.450> looks<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.750> though<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> front

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Orlando now it looks as though the front

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.139 
Orlando now it looks as though the front
is<00:00:40.379> starting<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> weaken<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.730> continues<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
is starting to weaken as it continues to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209

push<00:00:42.270> towards<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> south<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:43.890> hoping

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
push towards the south but we're hoping

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.290 
push towards the south but we're hoping
there's<00:00:44.430> enough<00:00:44.640> energy<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> atmosphere

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
there's enough energy in the atmosphere

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
there's enough energy in the atmosphere
to<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> system<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.039> bring

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
to get that system down here and bring

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
to get that system down here and bring
us<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.579> bit<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> rain<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:48.930> it's
