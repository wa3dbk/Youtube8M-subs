00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.099
 This is going to show how to slide a stitch and attach a new color 

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:12.099
 I want to start with a slip node 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 I take these yarns that are tail 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.500
 Wrap it on top 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.500
 I take this episode 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.500
 And wrap it through the main part of my yarn 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.730
 Insert hook under 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.760
 Then on top of this strand here 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.820
 This creates me a slip knots 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.529
 I will use the s slip knots, slip and stitch mix to attach new colors of yarn 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.899
 Now attach the new color 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 In any loop with stitch slip 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 I enclose my yarn between stitches here in one round 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.559
 Now we want to attach spinning 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.559
 Right here at the top of the toe 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:17.560
 Attach new color of yarn 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.170
 With slip knots for your crochet 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.020
 Crochet inserts 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.310
 Through the top of the stitch 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.099
 Wrap the yarn over your crochet hook 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.099
 Pull it through the stitch 

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.299
 Pull it through the knots slip 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.399
