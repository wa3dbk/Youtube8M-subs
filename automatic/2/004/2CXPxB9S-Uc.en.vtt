said<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.590> there's<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> science<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
said look there's a science all the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.310 
said look there's a science all the
things<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> don't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
things that you do that you don't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.369 
things that you do that you don't
question<00:01:01.670> did<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> learn<00:01:02.969> from<00:01:03.300> somebody<00:01:03.570> if

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
question did you learn from somebody if

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.320 
question did you learn from somebody if
it<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.769> true<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.750> valid<00:01:07.670> what<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.909> now

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it is true if it is valid what we now

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510 
it is true if it is valid what we now
has<00:01:09.780> become<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> ritual<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.830> us<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.369> do

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
has become a ritual for us that we do

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.270 
has become a ritual for us that we do
just<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> without<00:01:12.960> thinking

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
just because we do it without thinking

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.060 
just because we do it without thinking
has<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> science<00:01:14.820> behind<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:16.290> look<00:01:16.619> your

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
has a science behind it is look your

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
has a science behind it is look your
body<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> polarity<00:01:18.030> there's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:18.960> side

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
body is a polarity there's a right side

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.460 
body is a polarity there's a right side
and<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.650> left<00:01:19.680> side<00:01:20.479> there<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.509> two<00:01:21.659> nerves

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and a left side there are two nerves

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
and a left side there are two nerves
there's<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> even<00:01:23.520> people<00:01:24.049> he<00:01:25.049> said<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.439> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
there's the even people he said when you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
there's the even people he said when you
have<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> polarity<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.030> take<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> positive

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
have a polarity you take the positive

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
have a polarity you take the positive
and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> negative<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.579> hand<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and the negative the right hand on the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
and the negative the right hand on the
left<00:01:30.180> hand<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.720> electromagnetic<00:01:31.350> field

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
left hand the electromagnetic field

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
left hand the electromagnetic field
polarity<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> body<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:33.390> them

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
polarity of the body you put them

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080 
polarity of the body you put them
together<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.460> positive<00:01:35.460> plus<00:01:35.670> negative

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
together and positive plus negative

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.010 
together and positive plus negative
makes<00:01:36.270> neutral<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> creates<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.579> neutral

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
makes neutral so it creates a neutral

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.069 
makes neutral so it creates a neutral
space<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.100> magnetic<00:01:41.579> field<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.869> put

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
space in the magnetic field then you put

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.280 
space in the magnetic field then you put
your<00:01:43.229> thumbs<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.970> try<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.000> put<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.049> thumbs

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
your thumbs here try it put your thumbs

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.929 
your thumbs here try it put your thumbs
here<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.860> feels<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.220> there's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
here and see what it feels like there's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.370 
here and see what it feels like there's
a<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.149> notch<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.049> breastbone

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
a little notch right on your breastbone

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
a little notch right on your breastbone

and you'll feel your knuckles kind of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.990 
and you'll feel your knuckles kind of
fit<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.570> there

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
fit right in there

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
spinal cord and that nerve goes directly

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.880 
spinal cord and that nerve goes directly
up<00:02:03.440> here

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
up here

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.570 
up here
to<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.520> pineal<00:02:04.850> gland<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.420> Agena<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.430> when

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
to the pineal gland to the Agena so when

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.160 
to the pineal gland to the Agena so when
you<00:02:07.700> neutralize<00:02:08.240> your<00:02:08.420> positive<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.080> your

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
you neutralize your positive and your

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.800 
you neutralize your positive and your
negative<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.729> create<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.360> reflex

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
negative and you create the reflex

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.810 
negative and you create the reflex
action<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> vagus<00:02:12.830> nerve<00:02:13.040> it's

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
action of the vagus nerve it's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.690 
action of the vagus nerve it's
immediately<00:02:14.510> causes<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.500> pituitary<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
immediately causes the pituitary and the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.630 
immediately causes the pituitary and the
pineal<00:02:17.000> gland<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.690> secrete<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.340> when<00:02:19.520> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
pineal gland to secrete and when the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.420 
pineal gland to secrete and when the
pineal<00:02:19.970> gland<00:02:20.270> secretes<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.830> creates<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
pineal gland secretes it creates a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 
pineal gland secretes it creates a
resonance<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.150> your<00:02:23.450> brain<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.050> your<00:02:24.500> brain

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
resonance in your brain and your brain

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.570 
resonance in your brain and your brain
automatically<00:02:25.459> moves<00:02:26.300> out<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.660> your<00:02:26.959> normal

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
automatically moves out of your normal

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.640 
automatically moves out of your normal
rhythm<00:02:28.600> into<00:02:29.600> an<00:02:29.690> alpha<00:02:29.870> rhythm<00:02:30.260> which<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.470> a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
rhythm into an alpha rhythm which is a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.070 
rhythm into an alpha rhythm which is a
meditative<00:02:31.160> state<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.360> immediately<00:02:32.780> gives

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
meditative state so it immediately gives

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.530 
meditative state so it immediately gives
you<00:02:33.260> focus<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.950> centers<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:35.120> brings<00:02:35.390> you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
you focus it centers you it brings you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.390 
you focus it centers you it brings you
to<00:02:35.570> one<00:02:35.840> point<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.500> focuses<00:02:37.010> your<00:02:37.160> mind

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
to one point and it focuses your mind

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.949 
to one point and it focuses your mind
for<00:02:37.700> meditation<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:39.620> when<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:39.860> pray<00:02:40.959> you

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
for meditation so then when you pray you

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.610 
for meditation so then when you pray you
pray<00:02:41.989> from<00:02:42.260> your<00:02:42.560> heart<00:02:44.320> because<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.470> only

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
pray from your heart because the only

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.199 
pray from your heart because the only
prayer<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.160> works<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.610> prayer<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
prayer that works is the prayer of the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.449 
prayer that works is the prayer of the
bird<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.560> there's<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:48.830> whole<00:02:49.040> technology

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
bird so there's a whole technology

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
bird so there's a whole technology
behind<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.690> don't<00:02:50.810> even<00:02:51.050> think<00:02:51.290> about

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
behind it and we don't even think about

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.250 
behind it and we don't even think about
it<00:02:51.680> we<00:02:52.130> go<00:02:52.310> through<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.670> motions<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.959> found

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
it we go through the motions and I found

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.720 
it we go through the motions and I found
that<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.530> be<00:02:54.560> true<00:02:54.680> for<00:02:55.070> pretty<00:02:55.640> much

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that to be true for pretty much

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.490 
that to be true for pretty much
everything<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.420> our<00:02:56.540> lifestyle<00:02:57.049> everything

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
everything in our lifestyle everything

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.770 
everything in our lifestyle everything
has<00:02:57.799> a<00:02:57.830> science<00:02:58.280> behind<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.790> even<00:02:58.940> Otto<00:02:59.540> das

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
has a science behind it even Otto das

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.050 
has a science behind it even Otto das
das<00:03:00.470> has<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.769> science<00:03:01.220> behind<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:01.850> just

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
das has a science behind it we just

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.360 
das has a science behind it we just
recite<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.570> we<00:03:03.080> don't<00:03:03.200> understand<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:03.950> but

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
recite it we don't understand it but

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.460 
recite it we don't understand it but
there's<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.670> reason<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:05.570> sometime

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
there's a reason for it and sometime

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.260 
there's a reason for it and sometime
I'll<00:03:06.680> tell<00:03:06.860> you
