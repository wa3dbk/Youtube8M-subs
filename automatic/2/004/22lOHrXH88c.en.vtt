00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 have you ever seen watches of the future 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
 not good because today I'm going to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.580
 teach one 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.580

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.310
 review of this watch and 6 are from Tokyo 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720
 this brand of watches has had 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.880
 presence in movies as one of the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.500
 two avatar and tec the box where 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.740
 also the watch has a black color 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.740
 Elegant 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.180
 and good 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.800
 The first thing we are going to find 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.780
 open the box is the instructive 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.579
 This brand of watches specialize in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 have a very original way of showing 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.649
 the time and date each watch has a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.059
 different way of showing the time well 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.309
 that the instructions do not explain how 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.989
 read the time of that particular clock 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.519
 then we will find the ros 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.920
 placed between some sponges that what 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.629
 They protect perfect for shipping since 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.629

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.430
 better views 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.750
 here we can clearly see the way in 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.930
 that this clock shows us the time of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.820
 a very original very futuristic way of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.580
 glass the watch strap has a 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.170
 finished metallic black color very good 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.590

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.329

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.140
 equivalent explanation to the symbols of

 up we get the time in this 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.520
 case the two of the symbols in the middle 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.619
 the first two give us the minutes in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.420
 this case ten minutes while the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.859
 on the right gives us the milliseconds and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.340
 the symbols down are the 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.810
 seconds in this case 56 and finally 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.490
