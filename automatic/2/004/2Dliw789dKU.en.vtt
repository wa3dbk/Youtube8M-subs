00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.059
 good morning in the next video 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.549
 tutorial let's connect a dome to the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.639
 samsung brand with a recorder the 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 mark tagua the model of the engraver that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.680
 we are going to use is the hc vr 52 16 and the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.500
 dome model samsung ls cp 21 20 p 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 we will make this connection to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.890
 through two centuries of telemetry by 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.010
 485 The first thing we do is connect 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 the two fronts telemetry in the burning 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.760
 after the recorder in this case the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.879
 port of rs 485 is indicated as ' a and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 how they see would be the positive and the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 negative 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.489
 once we connect the cable 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.710
 telemetry in the sun in the dug it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.629
 we connect also in the dome in the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.239
 back 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.609
 we have a cream where it says 485 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 also positive and negative is very 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.080
 important that the polarity is good 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.149
 once done this we have to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 configure the tips of the bottom 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.349
 according to the protocol that we want 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.100
 use following this table that we 

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.080
 indicates 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 the different configurations of both 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 baud protocol and go number 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.400
 of the dome I in this case I will use 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 the pelco protocol of and assigned him as 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.720
 one's also modified the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 speed and has left you at 2400 audios 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.550
 once I have the configuration done in 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.320
 the dome 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.960
 also recorder 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.729
 and also the program of the next 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.880
 way inside the menu we're going to 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.780
 adjustments to the system and the system 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.780
 we deliver here in pre tz 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.390
 we use channel 1 because it's where 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.430
 we have put the video signal the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.430
 address in this case we put the 1 that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.790
 is the same as the dome of 1 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.060
 baud we modify them to 2400 and the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.940
 protocol we put it in hair that is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.790
 which we have also chosen once 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.270
 done this we come to apply to save 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:16.430
 the changes left the menu and now 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.670
 we would have control over the pt z 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.579
 this screen of controls appears and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.599
 already as we can observe we have control 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:28.830
 on the camera I take in this case the 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.170
 samsung brand 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:37.400
 now we go all the controls and as 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.400
 we see we have the connection made
