00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
 photo me this is the picture you send roland 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.380
 so in fact that roland wanted to make this image in black and white it was 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.510
 proved the quality what amuses me is that the character on a very background 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.349
 clearly than ford to leave room for laughter 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.879
 it takes to bring out the character we can be wrong 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.490
 constituencies according to a judicial source so each can earlier 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.770
 and so it's a little awkward for the treatment yet when that 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.140
 we are going to stop writing it's a little weird to please to do 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.220
 simple we simply learn a checkpoint we will put on that level 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.400
 and we will increase the brightness of people have found a little bit of 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.200
 brightness a little thicker 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.040
 the following themes knew to turn our image into black and white 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 so we will work with the photo facts as usual we will work 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.780
 with them the black and white by improving the contrast and if we will try to 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.080
 find the setting that wants to go to that level so we will work 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.040
 a little bit differently from usual because we did not have a lot of 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.199
 white areas we will have to work on these white skin areas 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.159
 the rights as opposed to the blues here for a little darkened the seasonal one 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.519
 will rework here disposable tsiranana for you who are on weekdays 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.549
 as his sister amadeus and then we will work also issue to 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.829
 the opposite of blues to access his account is that all 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.040
 items 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.260
 here he then put a little bit on the face but m the boss of fo 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.250
 dir a lot of white everywhere 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.080
 the next step would be to create 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 at the stock market level to give you a little more punch to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 maputo so we're going to do hugo barrès long fight bc here the tones are 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 numerous 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.799
 and again increased here the key elements in arranging for doll to 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.960
 about to the height 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 of the rise of the event we will try to clear people this area 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.549
 euro will experience them experienced a few checkpoints right here under the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.200
 eyes so on the part of places 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.190
 here the tone after the first checkpoint where you feel a little bit of 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.179
 light for most are found 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.530
 this density in childhood the quality touch or the public cone 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.039
 on her husband 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.140
 the image can prepare a split below here is a troop tower will q3 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.200
 put it off q3 deleted every day we ask for November I 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.720
 go make it a third with the key when we always darken that I 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.530
 want to give back to this new site 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.960
 then we will work on the contrast again so I'm going to work 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.640
 a little contrasting light munoz i-tv so there we will increase 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 still the contrast so as to give something good it's nice to this 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.099
 level besides going there 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.489
 they no longer trust for example 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.839
 I am going to believe that a redemption of limoges 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.029
 at this level so we will try to do something but its highest 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.489
 level for 15 years 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.629
 his way of being rather something in this sense m so between Swiss friends 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.699
 share 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.360
 mm art 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.860
 we will try to put a little diluted in the image so we will put 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.470
 a little bit left right as a custom company while never a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.560
 small balance at the photo level with a dynamic that targets the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.090
 handle way so that it is a little less training it should rather 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.349
 work a little like this until the trial 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.200
 maybe a little bit the image like this without having something that 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.509
 wish this dynamic 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.719
 on that side m si m 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.860
 we will still try it is charming to clear the eyes because I 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.719
 account for 5 years little too dark we notice two countries here we 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.739
 will just create another checkpoint at this level as well so 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.329
 give again a little bit better counter the fn eventually 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.400
 can still save the points so that it can still be done by a 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.799
 additional operation 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.390
 we will use here a selection degraded said m 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.700
 we can use the selection - to leave the face clear on this 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.789
 discontent in that sense 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.889
 here we are waiting for a poster the mask a little bit of patience for 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.819
 afp here are all the other clubs have been assigned to chart of accounts 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.249
 slightly increase the mask he has on this selection we will use 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:44.849
 as for kallisté color adjustment 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.539
 having rallied slightly to his white plumage simply step up a 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.420
 just a little bit away from having something 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.809
 little bit 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.340
 more for me 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.830
 we'll still put maybe a few checkpoints in the corners 6 a 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.050
 first site still darken a little longer here 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.409
 I understand a second defendant 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.349
 we can also darken ap 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.229
 we will be able to engage by dancing on the alt key to duplicate it and the 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.510
 matricide a few more days duplicate it 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.530
 I touch 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.090
 quebec and that's why to bring out the face 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.769
 a small dtn and it will be about 500 inmates how to make a mask 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.530
 here 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.949
 it's next to them 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.949
 strange since Cuba although when the portrait 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.300
 this is an example of which post-treatment with 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.280
 we can even more just a last touch show that have a lot 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.530
 more but let's stay there 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.590
 here is a big shot the title here is a small selection first I do not win 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.750
 here to fight against auxerre really do well to get out the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.500
 face his back all this is warning a hat that no longer use titrated 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.280
 to the world apart 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.090
 the elements that were taken 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.539
 we see here an example the cost of a degroof treatment
