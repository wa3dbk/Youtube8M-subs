00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 4 8 So many experts come together and it is warm and warm. 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.620
 Do you information on our institution also chew through at all, and yet when something like 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.610
 It went on. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 She plays a dentist would be so thin ah 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.470
 Why did you receive the file 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:28.260
 I do not have a wow file, 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.150
 I met a lot of experts in the field and had a lot of new exchanges 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 That's right. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 It is now commonplace to exchange views on the body of the expert body on an equal footing. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.750
 It reacted like a high school student 14 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm actually coming. Yeah. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 I've spoken to the acquaintances a bit. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.320
 Everybody's asking 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.190
 I 'm not going to add 8 Haha Dad is not very expensive eleven that know me 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.479
 It's a revelation. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.479
 I do not know accordance 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:04.680
 So I saw it in characters. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.189
 I was riding a horse . 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.189
 I'll ask. 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.289
 I'll go. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.250
 As a point of departure 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 Uh, I see a lot Handing viscosity stories 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 Now I will tell you the direction of my thinking and then I will support me first 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.990
 Iteulgeot the men who are you to judge the fit and the low expectations of yourself 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.250
 It's the same. Why ? So now it's time to judge. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.080
 I want to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 If you like 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.610
 4 So now would be judged according to the standards For now, all parties 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.730
 I'm on Tide comment candidate 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730
 Yes 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:02.780
 I think it's important to know what you think. 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.590
 I usually think that the support of the general listeners and the martial arts are different 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.940
 question 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:13.069
 So if you want to know what they think, 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.180
 Now, when you start to communicate with face to face , 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.810
 I do not know 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.040
 If you look forward to this, look at the glitches on the spot. 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.790
 Oh're not such a minute I thought I thought yeah 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:32.920
 How do you do that? 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.240
 14 that I do my best to be low, such as Ile 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.230
 If the times and people want 4 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:49.560
 Is not it possible to completely rule out any possibility of running? 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.560
 So I want you both to open the possibilities and make a decision now . 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 To lead hers, also in this sense it is like Chu Shi Biao 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.629
 My conclusion is to run away 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.629
 We wanted to get it down. 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.420
 It would conclude four lead 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.720
 It seems like some president needs to fly so usable 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.720
 In five stories 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.910
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.900
 If at some tables which President hasijyo God said hwangjeongil won 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.900
 Ahaha 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.160
 Let us say that the necessary tasks for the future are to be welfare justice . 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.490
 I gave it to you. 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.770
 What can you do then? 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:48.010
 I thought the most important thing now must communicate with its usual wrong with you, why 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.959
 Sweden is not the most representative of the welfare states. 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.850
 Sweden In the process of successfully completing a welfare state , 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.560
 The party took power. 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:03.880
 I did not do it at will, 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:08.200
 The score went hand in hand with long alternatives and unity . 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.850
 And yet the opposite is the case if the jeongman like Germany, the Conservative Party staff 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:18.730
 But the progressive party and the power to come out again to build a welfare state 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:23.680
 So I can not push this alone. 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.000
 There are a lot of areas that need to be done . 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.800
 Can I wrong 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.490
 It is easy to collect such opinions because we have a lot of money and a lot of money. 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.710
 not 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.020
 uh 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.970
 I always think that when I have a problem, I solve the vocabulary easily . 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.800
 same 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:49.050
 Because there are a lot of really capable people in our country 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:55.110
 Workaround rather not difficult to find cases rather more important thing is the problem 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:59.220
 It is more important to build consensus because many people 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.420
 Hasimyeonseo think the problem is another minute that issues opinions are so different 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.500
 It's scattered. 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.500
 That's not going to solve the problem, so it 's important to us now .
