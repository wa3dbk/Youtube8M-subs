 usable stoner revenue I have

 made a couple of videos ago and I already have it 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:34.789

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.550
 discovers that a disc 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.020
 then he continued 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:03.159
 ok i did the first baking sheet i think 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.530
 15 minutes in the oven must be honored 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:08.020
 you stop honestly burned 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.930
 then watch them thunderstorms in the oven for 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.259
 15 minutes at 180 degrees and see you 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.250
 when the clashes are ready for later 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.530
 ok 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.230
 here I am back and what sense of another 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.600
 Iberian 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:27.490
 this recipe facts come about 50 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.100
 biscuits left just 15 minutes and go 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:36.300
 inside the box of the 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.300
 royal bank and mine placed inside 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.729
 the cups 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:47.790
 the students in whom you fight those for i 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:50.280
 cupcake and in mexico and inside one like that 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.370
 which are a little nicer before they have 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.479
 tasted even one is really word 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.210
 To link this card to you from 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.040
 oven made goal 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.610
 I had shown it precisely in that 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:10.050
 wants to use it video and here it is now 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.220
 he did his duty very well for 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.710
 the reasons 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.390
 said I hated it though for the second e 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.900
 the third use because I did three 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.600
 informed no longer gave oiled eg 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.750
 it was fantastic 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.080
 so I think I'll always use this 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.170
 because I think it's really one 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.230
 Incredible cunning because you can't 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.640
 wastes more than baking paper 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.280
 instead this is the structure of 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.330
 use as many times as you want e 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.400
 I think he does his job 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.780
 perfectly so I recommend it 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.470
 I also wanted to make her a small region 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.180
 He was caught on from here then many children 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.300
 that some biscuits covered them with 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.280
 sugar or how do I inform them? 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.800
 of sugar and sweating tissues 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.130
 dubbed clash for buying that in 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.460
 a photo of these there are some with 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.460
 sugar 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.380
 the circles ships both liked let me know 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.940
