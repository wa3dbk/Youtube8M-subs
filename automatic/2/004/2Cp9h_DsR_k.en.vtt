be ties in with cholesterol right that's
right<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> case<00:00:42.450> well<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.809> have

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
right that's not the case well we have

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.569 
right that's not the case well we have
olive<00:00:43.350> oil<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> actually<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.280> extra

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
olive oil here and actually it's extra

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
olive oil here and actually it's extra
virgin<00:00:44.820> olive<00:00:45.059> oil<00:00:45.360> usually<00:00:46.140> considered<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
virgin olive oil usually considered the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
virgin olive oil usually considered the
finest<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> comes<00:00:47.730> from<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> first

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
finest because it comes from the first

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
finest because it comes from the first
pressing<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> olives<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> has<00:00:50.250> more

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
pressing of the olives so it has more

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
pressing of the olives so it has more
antioxidants<00:00:50.940> than<00:00:51.449> any<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> other<00:00:52.350> olive

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
antioxidants than any of the other olive

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
antioxidants than any of the other olive
oils<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.820> rich<00:00:54.059> source<00:00:54.390> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
oils and it's a rich source of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.270 
oils and it's a rich source of
monounsaturated<00:00:55.110> fats<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.219> are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
monounsaturated fats which are

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920 
monounsaturated fats which are
heart-healthy<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:57.390> been<00:00:57.510> shown<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> help

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
heart-healthy have been shown to help

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
heart-healthy have been shown to help
reduce<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> risk<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.800> heart<00:00:58.980> disease<00:00:59.039> does
