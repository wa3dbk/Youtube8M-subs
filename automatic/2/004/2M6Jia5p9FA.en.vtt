caves when it's night have the fight off
creepers<00:01:59.729> with<00:02:00.000> whatever<00:02:00.810> they've<00:02:01.079> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
creepers with whatever they've just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.100 
creepers with whatever they've just
explored<00:02:02.390> found<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.540> their<00:02:03.659> cave<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.200> um<00:02:04.409> yeah

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
again all you really need to do is place

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.990 
again all you really need to do is place
to<00:02:09.420> gravel<00:02:09.720> blocks<00:02:09.929> above<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.000> they

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
to gravel blocks above you and they

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.760 
to gravel blocks above you and they
should<00:02:12.209> fall<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> bottom<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.319> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
should fall down to the bottom so there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.180 
should fall down to the bottom so there
right<00:02:14.130> there<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.670> between<00:02:14.940> them<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
right there you're in between them and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.950 
right there you're in between them and
it<00:02:17.190> should<00:02:17.400> show<00:02:17.550> everything<00:02:17.760> around<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.120> to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
it should show everything around you to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.520 
it should show everything around you to
get<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.460> get<00:02:20.610> even<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.350> can

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
get them to get even so that you can

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.650 
get them to get even so that you can
barely<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.120> distance

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
barely you can see more of a distance

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.480 
barely you can see more of a distance
around<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.050> use<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.220> arrow

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
around you use the up and down arrow

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.860 
around you use the up and down arrow
keys<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.910> kind<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.150> toggle<00:02:27.360> back<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.660> forth

keys just kind of toggle back and forth

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.550 
keys just kind of toggle back and forth
between<00:02:28.260> them<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:30.540> might<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.350> easiest

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
between them it might be the easiest

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.490 
between them it might be the easiest
thing<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:32.150> turn<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.930> cursor<00:02:34.350> around
