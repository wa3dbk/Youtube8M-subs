00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello to all and sonia to click at 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
 point fr is today i'm taking advantage of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.360
 Mother's Day to prepare a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.549
 rainbow cake 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.369
 it's a request you made me 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.520
 on the channel and on the blog so 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 let's go let's go we'll do some 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 vanilla sponge cake to start with and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.580
 then we will make a little cream at 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 mascarpone and lime it will go 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.430
 between layers of colorful sponge cake on 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.210
 will start by beating the eggs 4 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.719
 eggs and sugar 340 ladies with the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.719
 electric mixer 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.500
 when the sweet egg mix well where 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 sir we will add the flour and the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 yeast little by little and we will mix 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:07.740
 delicately finally at low speed with 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 the whip we now add the milk and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.150
 the same vanilla I'll leave 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.799
 turn the robot at low speed and I 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.799
 will add all alone slowly 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.280
 we will slightly mix the butter before 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.600
 to incorporate it it must be at 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:45.360
 room temperature so at these words we 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 now incorporate the butter our 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.410
 leg is ready 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.900
 while the oven is preheated to 180 Â° 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.270
 will now divide it into siebel's 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.360
 fairly fair way and then we'll 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.860
 the colored with gel dyes if 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.690
 you did not use any of them 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.420
 dyes powder but avoid them 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.450
 liquid dyes that in general are 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.330
 still less powerful now 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.040
 we have our sites bowl the advantage actually 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.270
 to take so beautiful the identical is that 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.130
 I did not need to weigh the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.540
 preparation so now that we have 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 divided our paw into sivom goes 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.320
 now the colorful blue green 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.910
 purple red orange and yellow 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.740
 we have our six colors we will now 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.150
 move on to cooking we will do them 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.550
 cook a good ten minutes 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.670
 each turn in a mold that can 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.870
 between 18 and 20 cm in diameter not necessary 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.459
 to go further because otherwise you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.980
 may have a thick sponge cake 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.020
 far too fine harmful Genoese are 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.510
 cooked they said very very pretty 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.370
 color we will now spend the cream 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.209
 with lime that we will put between 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.860
 layers is safe and all around the cake 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.750
 so we mix 250 g of mascarpone 150 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 philadelphia g or two without bad 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.980
 games it's according to your preferences 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.080
 according to your habits you can also 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.080
 use the distributor mark 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.580
 and we add 125 g of icing sugar 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.300
 will now whip the preparation 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.300
 for a few minutes 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.170
 as I planted myself a little in the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.030
 quantities of icing sugar I added some 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.030
 mascarpone and blood would I have you 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 will put the exact recipe with all the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.150
 ingredients in description of the video 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.850
 we will now add 4 spoons to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.240
 lemon juice lemon juice 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.560
 green 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.350
 me it's bottled but you 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.930
 use lemon juice freight 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:48.180
 it would be better besides 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.770
 go to the editing for that nothing more 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:00.080
 simple we will take our first 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:00.080
 disc of sponge cake cream 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.170
 no matter if it's overflowing because of all 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:21.579
 way after we'll do the outline 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:23.880
 also and then we put the next 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.880
 disk 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.659
 this is our renewal cac is over you 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.150
 have two options either leave you 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.370
 dry a good hour and you put back 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.740
 an ice age layer exactly like 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.599
 we just made so that 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.330
 be really white and that and that 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.580
 no longer sees the thicknesses 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.220
 or you cover it with dough 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.360
 sugar against if you cover it 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.030
 sugar paste should be done at the last 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.560
 moment because the sugar dough likes 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.389
 not too much moisture that has in the fridge 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.490
 while it is a cake that is full 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.500
 philadelphia cream cheese etc. 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.379
 we can not keep it 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.699
 elsewhere than in the fridge so decorated the 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.530
 last moment me that's what I'm going 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.289
 do I'm going to leave it a few hours 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.240
 in the fridge and then I 'll put some 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.659
 small decorative dough keys 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.810
 sugar 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.360
 you will put a picture of the result as well 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.590
 only a picture of the cut 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.940
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.469
