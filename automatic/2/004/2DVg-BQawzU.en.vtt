00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.910
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.990
 Today's theme is 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.209
 Switching of the whole surface random will be here 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.929
 I do not know where to come the sphere switching 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 Anyway, I would like to introduce to you how to make it smooth 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 The contents of this time are those who want to become strong in rally 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 I do not know where to come the ball 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.400
 I want to be strong in the rally 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.509
 The person who is thinking is the change of oneself 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.750
 If you feel that the speed of switching is slow 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.200
 It is recommended for such people 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.180
 The beginners and intermediate players are totally random 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.690
 I will try to hit a ball I do not know where to come 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.850
 I do not continue in the middle It is a nice ball 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 I can't keep on typing and I've been caught in the opposite 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.250
 It is easy to become unstable body, but very good player of advanced person 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 I said without my body being shaken 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.350
 You can keep hitting well at any time 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.010
 What is the difference? 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.950
 As it is a form that we solved, please try to reference by all means 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 Now it's a point, divide it into three points 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.890
 Tips for good random switching 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.760
 The first point I want to introduce 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.810
 It is movement of racket fore and back racket 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.960
 The movement of the racket is linear movement 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.530
 Please be conscious as an image 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.350
 It's on the table tennis table It's on the table tennis table 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.310
 It feels like you move 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.299
 It usually passes from below 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.479
 It feels like passing from below 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.690
 I hit this fore and came back next 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.000
 Get out of the bottom and be late 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.749
 But fast players hit and came to Abbac 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.849
 I'm going straight to the pack and vice versa 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.430
 While hitting the back and players move in a straight line 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.599
 Even if it takes to pull backswing, this switch is 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.799
 Bad players hit backhand 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.159
 I am broken down from coming from below at Aphor 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.180
 It looks like it takes a long time to respond 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.120
 Because there is a great difference here, always move a straight line 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.919
 Anyway, to switch quickly 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.700
 Keep in mind that you are moving straight 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.159
 Next is the second point The second point is 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.950
 Basically it's like waiting for back 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.069
 It is feeling Please be aware of back waiting 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.870
 Even if you don't wait in the back posture completely, as consciousness 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.040
 It's like this when you can come back 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.579
 You can come back at any time with this way 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.340
 If you go to the forehand in a situation like 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.069
 Please be aware of this and sometimes wait fore 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.629
 There is a player who is actually doing the swing 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.029
 I want you to experience a little 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.779
 A player who is waiting for you 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.579
 I will pull a lot roughly 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.499
 I will try to pull it big when the ball comes 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.199
 I'm waiting for you to hit a good ball 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.400
 I pulled the racket when I came back from here 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.939
 I can not cope by the form that the body swims by all means 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.739
 But from the attitude of waiting for back 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.139
 You can pull backswing when you move 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.569
 Because you can pull the racket when you move 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.879
 Even if I'm basically waiting for back 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.409
 The fore is never late 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.419
 But what is it from waiting for? 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.199
 This difference is very late 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.160
 Remember, so random switching 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.459
 Basically, good people are always back 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.000
 I was conscious of my attitude to go 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.430
 One important point is that waiting 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.100
 I think it can be raised 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.300
 Next is the third point The third point is 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.310
 It is absolute NG first straight movement to lower the racket and wait 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.400
 I told you to wait for the next back 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.069
 After that you want to hit the drive firmly 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.470
 It is absolutely NG to lower the racket 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.220
 When I lowered my racket and waited 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.590
 The key to lowering the racket is backswing 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.520
 Weight is steady when waiting in the pulled state 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.699
 I'm riding and I can start moving 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.000
 I can not do a good player 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.500
 Judging the coming course and pulling according to the ball 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.150
 I'm coming to Aphor and I pull 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.460
 From the state of waiting firmly with feeling like saying 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.909
 I have been able to draw 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.319
 If you are not good at switching this all random, you hit me 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.220
 I want to hit another one with a good ball 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.659
 If I come here more than I thought I would pull and wait 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.689
 I feel like I can not move anymore 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.909
 So be sure to draw along with the ball 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.229
 To draw along with the ball 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.330
 Please be conscious and judge yourself 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.379
 I will wait for the racket to go down and back swing ahead 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.520
 In such a situation that you will pull 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.370
 If you come to the foreground in this state if you have pulled 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.150
 The system is completely broken 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.229
 But if you come to the fore in this condition 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.099
 You can move and hit this too 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.319
 Now look at the shadow play I did 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.870
 I wonder if I can make an image somehow 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.250
 I think always to match the ball 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.180
 Match the racket to the ball that pulls the racket 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.639
 Please try to be conscious of pulling
