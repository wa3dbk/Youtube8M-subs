00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
the changes to resilience first of all

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.270 
the changes to resilience first of all
Blizzard<00:00:09.960> made<00:00:10.170> their<00:00:10.380> plans<00:00:10.559> known<00:00:11.040> that

Blizzard made their plans known that

Blizzard made their plans known that
they<00:00:11.370> would<00:00:11.519> remove<00:00:11.700> PvP<00:00:12.570> resilience<00:00:13.080> from

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
they would remove PvP resilience from

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.860 
they would remove PvP resilience from
most<00:00:13.830> pvp<00:00:14.460> items<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.509> went<00:00:15.660> one

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
most pvp items they actually went one

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990 
most pvp items they actually went one
step<00:00:16.020> further<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.619> removed<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> from<00:00:17.520> every

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
step further and removed it from every

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.960 
step further and removed it from every
single<00:00:18.390> PvP<00:00:18.810> item<00:00:19.109> v.v.v<00:00:20.010> items<00:00:20.520> still<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:20.939> a

single PvP item v.v.v items still get a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.480 
single PvP item v.v.v items still get a
lot<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.210> pvp<00:00:21.750> power<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.740> see<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
lot of pvp power but as you can see it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000 
lot of pvp power but as you can see it
gives<00:00:23.699> no<00:00:23.880> resilience<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.740> can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
gives no resilience at all now you can

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.920 
gives no resilience at all now you can
see<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.550> my<00:00:26.820> resilience<00:00:27.240> reading<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
see here that my resilience reading is

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.250 
see here that my resilience reading is
that<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> 65-percent<00:00:29.189> baseline<00:00:30.119> stat<00:00:30.510> Mineo<00:00:30.960> be

sixty-five percent unifiers a naked
level<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.870> character<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.670> still<00:00:35.700> gem

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
level one character but we can still gem

level one character but we can still gem
and<00:00:36.660> enchant<00:00:36.809> items<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.920> resilience<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.579> by

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and enchant items for resilience and by

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
and enchant items for resilience and by
doing<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.020> quite<00:00:40.260> easily<00:00:40.440> build<00:00:41.040> up

doing so you can quite easily build up
as<00:00:41.280> high<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.460> 69<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.450> maybe<00:00:42.719> even<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.140> seventy

resilience rating myself along with many
other<00:01:02.730> players<00:01:03.059> hope<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.629> actual<00:01:04.140> DPS<00:01:04.680> stats

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
other players hope that actual DPS stats

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670 
other players hope that actual DPS stats
like<00:01:05.519> pvp<00:01:05.909> power<00:01:06.090> mastery<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:06.960> crit<00:01:07.380> might

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
like pvp power mastery and crit might

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
like pvp power mastery and crit might
actually<00:01:07.890> stop<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> gym<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.119> again<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.080> let's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
actually stop in gym for again so let's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
actually stop in gym for again so let's
see<00:01:10.500> how<00:01:10.530> each<00:01:10.950> stat<00:01:11.280> affects<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> damage<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
see how each stat affects the damage of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
see how each stat affects the damage of
a<00:01:12.479> chaos<00:01:12.810> hold<00:01:13.080> arguably<00:01:14.040> Destro's<00:01:14.549> most

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a chaos hold arguably Destro's most

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179 
a chaos hold arguably Destro's most
important<00:01:15.390> ability<00:01:15.810> okay<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> going

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
important ability okay so this is going

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.429 
important ability okay so this is going
to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> benchmark<00:01:18.150> chaos<00:01:18.659> bolt<00:01:18.810> I've<00:01:19.110> gemmed

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to be a benchmark chaos bolt I've gemmed

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
to be a benchmark chaos bolt I've gemmed
no<00:01:19.830> extra<00:01:20.220> stats<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> my<00:01:21.270> tag<00:01:21.479> has

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
no extra stats for this my tag has

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
no extra stats for this my tag has
jammed<00:01:21.930> nore<00:01:22.680> resilience<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.549> a

jammed nore resilience and is a
65-percent<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.400> damage

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
65-percent and as you can see the damage

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
65-percent and as you can see the damage
is<00:01:26.970> fairly<00:01:27.479> low<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.470> 98<00:01:29.189> k<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:30.390> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
is fairly low really at 98 k this is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
is fairly low really at 98 k this is
just<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:31.979> which

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just so that we can see from now which

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
just so that we can see from now which
staff<00:01:32.729> gives<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> biggest<00:01:33.659> increase<00:01:34.229> from

here now first of all we have crit and

here now first of all we have crit and
this<00:01:37.229> stuff<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.500> said<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> increase<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
this stuff is said to increase the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
this stuff is said to increase the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
damage of chaos falls directly but it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.670 
damage of chaos falls directly but it
builds<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:42.360> slow<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> interview<00:01:43.290> gym<00:01:43.560> at

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
less damage true but the point is that

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.750 
less damage true but the point is that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
her resilience is lowering my damage but

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.400 
her resilience is lowering my damage but

my intellect is able to increase it

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
now guys and I thought I'd to share what

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.160 
now guys and I thought I'd to share what
I<00:05:04.520> think<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.000> really<00:05:05.480> really<00:05:05.690> good<00:05:05.870> news

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
I think it is really really good news

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.290 
I think it is really really good news
and<00:05:06.470> that's<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.950> resilience<00:05:07.490> won't<00:05:07.850> be<00:05:08.150> the

and that's that resilience won't be the

undisputed king of stats anymore because

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.660 
I was getting quite tired of that
personally<00:05:12.470> everyone<00:05:12.980> does<00:05:13.130> stacking

personally everyone does stacking

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.240 
personally everyone does stacking
resilience<00:05:14.150> because<00:05:14.480> it<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.230> best<00:05:15.410> at<00:05:15.680> if
