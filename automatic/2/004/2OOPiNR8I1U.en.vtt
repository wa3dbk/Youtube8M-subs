knight black is a headed material but
he's<00:01:15.630> behind<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.680> development<00:01:17.750> ok<00:01:18.780> he<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
he's behind in development ok he can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.810 
he's behind in development ok he can
play<00:01:19.860> Knight<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.189> f6<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.880> Knight<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.780> d6

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
perhaps Knight to f6 was better then we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
perhaps Knight to f6 was better then we
