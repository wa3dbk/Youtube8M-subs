00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 hello everyone for the non-experts 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 we are one of the signatures with crude pine 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.460
 of advertising in Italy and this is the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 set of the new vodafone spot then 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 pine what's going on and it happens 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.500
 a very important thing like all the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 Sometimes something new happens 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 we are launching a character that you 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.559
 it will darken because the divertissement is known 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.269
 you call it like me is called pine 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.380
 only he has something more than me 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.180
 which is much more elegant 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.079
 being a penguin and therefore 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 practically lives in a tuxedo or in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.270
 titl or how we want to say intac 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.100
 site if I wanted to say American and it is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 an elegant person who has a range of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 particularity that manages to entertain 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 the public as you can see here maybe 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.570
 there are some of his fans that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.729
 will launch this character through 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.369
 our new communication 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.500
 if you find it difficult to work with a 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.360
 character like pine is at the level of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.509
 production is creative 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.080
 or the laws plus look at the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.300
 difficulties through also how to say 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 serious professionals as you see from 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.490
 monica director at the production company 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.590
 that to the filmaster who put us in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.440
 provision all their expertise for 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.209
 to succeed in concretizing then what 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.550
 it is our job to enclose everything 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.440
 how much in thirty or in 60 seconds a 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.010
 depending on what we would have 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 so on television and our work 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.290
 is to compact then you know the thing 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.540
 not easy is to have a 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 mechanism like the one that is a whole 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 of animatronic and with a head did 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.630
 in a certain way with the body inside 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.520
 a person as you know that moves 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.150
 so you have to look for a series of 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.260
 difficult thing is like saying 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.270
 solved by experience 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.060
 I also imagine it's a team effort 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.230
 how many people have worked on it 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.840
 this creativity and is a like all 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.860
 work of is is a work of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.660
 concertazione and we I pine coarse and 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.510
 roberto Battle that we are like saying i 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.180
 creative directors of the agency 18 61 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.850
 united us what we do 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.890
 we coordinate then the idea 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.110
 embryonic comes to us the idea the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.700
 we develop we try to understand what it is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.190
 the potential obviously through 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.560
 what is the logic of the product that 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.900
 we must launch and then at that point there 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.880
 we include within the agency but 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.040
 especially within the team 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.900
 that is the extended customer who 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.830
 start with us and implement 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.640
 what is a path of 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.160
 communication 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.480
 once established on paper that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.489
 that we would like to do we find ourselves doing 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 move on like saying the word to the house of 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.790
 production that at this point must 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.160
 solve all those that are 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.580
 technical difficulties to do it like 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 I said before make everything easy 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.290
 that in reality it is not easy for others 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.570
 creative credits and director of the spot 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.769
 then the director of the monica is called 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.840
 spot and as I told you the agency is 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.670
 we of the 18 sant a united then there is 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.680
 federico ghiso and giorgio cignoni who 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.709
 they are the creative directors with us 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.910
 on this project and the house in 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.860
 production of the filmaster 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.930
 so these are what the architects say 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.209
 where, of course, from there they unfold one 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.489
 series of people who do yes but look 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.280
 just take a look around and you 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.840
 realize 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.970
 there are dozens and dozens of people 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.560
 involved in this project 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.560
 thank you so much bureaucracy soon
