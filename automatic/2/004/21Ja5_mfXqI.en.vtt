00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.920

 I really like when mildred books are very 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.210
 interesting and so heartfelt 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.909
 story the next two books for me they 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.909
 namely equal to one hundred percent 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.900
 like it john green blame the stars and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.390
 if i stay gay uniform 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.210
 I read these two books quite recently 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.240
 and above and the stars used to be somewhere for a month 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.490
 maybe a half and two films I watched 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.430
 for one week and I'm crazy 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.350
 liked to blame the stars very 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.920
 interesting soulful story and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 Loved it if I stay after 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.829
 such films and books I think for a long time 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 and long reflecting on such stories and 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.149
 Here is the fate of the following 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.670
 the book is the power of athens a gift i already have you 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.630
 she said that something was my favorite 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.789
 clearance dnr is beautiful and not 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.000
 I know what a cozy book I got by the way 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.100
 already three years ago, and it says 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.290
 if you could choose yourself for christmas 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.690
 any just one gift to you 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.270
 chose and straight made as letter 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.990
 written to whom from whom the book is very 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.910
 interesting 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.610
 by the way this book was formed by me 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 my first plan rule is if you started 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.870
 I will read the book until the end as 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.040
 holy book me was such a story then 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.870
 that the first 50 pages to me on me are very 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.270
 I liked it and I could not understand what 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.530
 what happens to the whole boy with 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.060
 turkey and some man who 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.250
 incomprehensible at first what he does and what 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.880
 general occurs in this book but when 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.880
 started to wrap up 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.390
 It unfolds not in a very 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.410
 and now I have one of my favorites 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.930
 The next three books are the Disney series. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.430
 all the more beautiful story of the queen and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.160
 monster 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.900
 impossible love story by the way this is 2 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.040
 the only glue that was laid out 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.540
 photo in instagram and last Maleficent 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.110
 here 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:29.860
 pictures are very beautiful design and 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.560
 here is such a small touch 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.989
 such you see as a gray white transition 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 on all fours 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.310
 The next two books are Russian authors . 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.269
 Russian modern author is 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.100
 the only one that I liked was not 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.950
 considering of course the classics mean 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.820
 modern mail dating from Ulyana 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.510
 began a series of books of any kind 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.989
 this is the fourth book of madness madness 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.709
 beast yes if someone like such 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.280
 series like diary diaries or vampire 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.940
 Here is the real profile of something else I 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.260
 sure that he is one hundred percent 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.530
 love a series of love beyond the very 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.229
 interesting story is very interesting plot 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.500
 by the way these books are not you cannot buy 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.840
 not in some ordinary stores or 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.830
 online stores can be ordered 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.039
 only in 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.770
 vkontakte hives especially strong-willed I personally tell her 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.219
 write what book do you want 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.659
 purchase it goes you know what 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:41.050
 prints and sends you still I have 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:43.360
 love poison book is not a series but simply 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.210
 separate novel and here I have such 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.919
 bookmarks on my favorite moments 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.560
 still read let condemn me well and 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.439
 Of course, the entire series of any overseas is 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.330
 It seems 6 books the next book is 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.250
 james kane revered he was they twice 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.210
 the postman always calls twice 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.729
 I would tell you books in books 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.050
 August as well as about this italic 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.710
 alessandro baricco silk is very unusual 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.840
 registration 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.279
 this book could be done three times 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.099
 less so as very little text and such 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.300
 here are the big skip the next two books 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.969
 this is nora roberts 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.949
 fall in love with jack and big secrets 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:29.979
 small hotel I really like 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:33.159
 design and what are such cute and 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.409
 beautiful and very interesting by the way 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:41.440
 there are so many stories 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:45.729
 the next book is sesili ahern there 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.800
 where does the rainbow end this book is a lot 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.389
 there was another problem but since I gave 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.699
 read her friends and her friend 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.979
 lost 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.729
 such a book is cut one of mine 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:02.529
 favorite books 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:05.069
 nothing so this book is done all in 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.250
 somehow correspondence either letters either 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.729
 some 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.729
 text messages and either calls here a dozen to 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.580
 of the self it reads very closely 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:19.240
 easy to close and there is too much description 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.960
 long or something like this so 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.960
 next book last is alice 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.930
 siebold cute bones 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.339
 you are the book that you need me and she told me then 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.840
 really liked it by the way too 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:36.730
 present 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.630
 so the last book is 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:44.010
 sherlyn kenyon dark embrace this book 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:48.820
 I bought too long ago when I 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.410
 probably when it was still watching twilight 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.630
 when films were still coming out 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.510
 it seems to me already easy for five years exactly 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:59.590
 this book when i had such 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:02.470
 transitions can said age when i 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.930
 I loved all the vampire I 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.150
 I do not remember what this book is about 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.270
 I liked it for a long time, by the way, I only remember 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.130
 the fact that this is a series of 27 books 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.810
 time has been going to prove something like this 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:19.570
 but they are not really related like this on this 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:22.450
 book 2 take with with 2 shelves 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:25.060
 run out but it 's not all be yet 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.010
