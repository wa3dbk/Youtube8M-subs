00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
your saddle in there and it had like a

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.160 
your saddle in there and it had like a
rack<00:03:55.790> for<00:03:56.000> your<00:03:56.030> saddle<00:03:56.450> pad

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
rack for your saddle pad

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.040 
rack for your saddle pad
and<00:03:57.230> like<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> bit<00:03:58.190> box<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:58.819> everything<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.540> and

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
and like a bit box and everything so and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.300 
and like a bit box and everything so and
you<00:04:00.170> can<00:04:00.319> pick<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.620> color<00:04:00.830> on<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.130> outside

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
you can pick the color on the outside

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.920 
you can pick the color on the outside
too<00:04:01.700> they're<00:04:01.910> made<00:04:02.030> of<00:04:02.150> like<00:04:02.300> metal<00:04:02.690> not<00:04:02.900> wood

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
too they're made of like metal not wood

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.630 
too they're made of like metal not wood
so<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.470> think<00:04:03.590> they're<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:03.920> bit<00:04:04.040> more<00:04:04.130> durable

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
so I think they're a bit more durable

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.820 
so I think they're a bit more durable
and<00:04:04.760> lighter<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.390> little<00:04:05.690> less<00:04:06.170> expensive<00:04:06.800> than

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
and lighter a little less expensive than

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.000 
and lighter a little less expensive than
all<00:04:07.190> one<00:04:07.400> family<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:08.410> still<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.440> little<00:04:09.650> pricey

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
all one family but still a little pricey

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.440 
all one family but still a little pricey
