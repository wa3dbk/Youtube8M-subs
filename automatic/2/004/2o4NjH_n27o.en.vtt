00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
on the figure is not too bad I really

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
on the figure is not too bad I really
like<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.009> fit<00:01:38.220> head<00:01:38.460> sculpt<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.180> figure

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
like the fit head sculpt on this figure

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
like the fit head sculpt on this figure
I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.750> Hasbro<00:01:40.079> did<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> great<00:01:40.829> job<00:01:41.130> capturing

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I think Hasbro did a great job capturing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
I think Hasbro did a great job capturing
the<00:01:41.909> look<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> Thanos<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> sculpting

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the look of Thanos I like the sculpting

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
the look of Thanos I like the sculpting
of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.399> skin<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> teeth<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
of the skin and the teeth and I like the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
of the skin and the teeth and I like the
grin<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> good<00:01:48.240> facial

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
grin I think it's a good facial

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.770 
grin I think it's a good facial
expression<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.860> Thanos<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.000> overall<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.570> think

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
expression for Thanos so overall I think

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
expression for Thanos so overall I think
the<00:01:52.020> head<00:01:52.200> sculpt<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.009> solid<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.579> this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
know may have looked better if they'd

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.180 
know may have looked better if they'd
use<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.720> kind<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.110> same<00:02:26.290> metallic<00:02:26.770> paint<00:02:27.010> on

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
the plastic pieces it's not that it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.800

looks terrible or anything I just you
know<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.230> think<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:32.710> could<00:02:32.830> have<00:02:32.890> been<00:02:32.980> some

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
know I think there could have been some

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.060 
know I think there could have been some
more<00:02:33.490> detail<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.600> area<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.650> otherwise<00:02:35.920> I

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
more detail in that area but otherwise I

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.430 
more detail in that area but otherwise I
think<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.580> looks<00:02:36.760> good<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.600> body<00:02:37.810> you

think it looks good the the body you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.060 
think it looks good the the body you
know<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.620> basically<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.580> kind<00:02:40.240> of<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.390> glossy

overall<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.200> think<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.770> figure<00:03:12.040> looks<00:03:12.310> good

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
overall I think the figure looks good

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.390 
overall I think the figure looks good
and<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.270> really<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.900> head<00:03:14.110> sculpt<00:03:14.620> I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
and I really like the head sculpt I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.880 
and I really like the head sculpt I
think<00:03:16.000> has<00:03:16.209> ro<00:03:16.420> did<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.630> great<00:03:16.930> job<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.500> with

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
think has ro did a great job with with

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.050 
think has ro did a great job with with
the<00:03:18.040> face<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.489> everything<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.630> figure

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the face and everything on this figure

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.000 
the face and everything on this figure
so<00:03:22.060> my<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.540> only<00:03:22.840> real<00:03:23.320> complaint<00:03:23.560> with

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
so my really only real complaint with

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.770 
so my really only real complaint with
this<00:03:24.160> figures<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.760> do<00:03:24.820> think<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.269> their<00:03:25.600> nose

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
this figures I do think that their nose

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.410 
this figures I do think that their nose
is<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> little<00:03:26.080> bit<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.769> short<00:03:27.070> side<00:03:27.420> he

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
is a little bit on the short side he

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.960 
is a little bit on the short side he
stands<00:03:28.840> at<00:03:29.260> seven<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.010> half<00:03:30.040> inches<00:03:30.640> tall

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
stands at seven and a half inches tall

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.610 
stands at seven and a half inches tall
and<00:03:32.580> he's<00:03:33.580> actually<00:03:33.880> not<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.570> tallest<00:03:35.140> figure

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
and he's actually not the tallest figure

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.000 
and he's actually not the tallest figure
in<00:03:35.950> this<00:03:36.130> Avengers<00:03:36.880> wave<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.830> even<00:03:38.830> know<00:03:38.890> he's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
in this Avengers wave to even know he's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.790 
in this Avengers wave to even know he's
the<00:03:39.190> build<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.489> figure<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.720> Hulk<00:03:40.930> figure<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
the build a figure the Hulk figure the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.440 
the build a figure the Hulk figure the
age<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.160> Ultron<00:03:42.519> Hulk<00:03:42.790> figure<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.239> actually

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
age of Ultron Hulk figure is actually

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.500 
age of Ultron Hulk figure is actually
taller<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:45.220> me<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:45.519> dannis<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.300> Hulk

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
taller and to me I think dannis and Hulk

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.009 
taller and to me I think dannis and Hulk
should<00:03:46.750> be<00:03:46.870> about<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.260> same<00:03:47.470> height<00:03:49.019> areas

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
should be about the same height areas

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.040 
should be about the same height areas
next<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:51.030> diamond<00:03:52.030> select<00:03:52.450> marvel

next to that diamond select marvel

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.410 
next to that diamond select marvel
select<00:03:53.260> Thanos<00:03:53.920> figure<00:03:54.340> now<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.239> is

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
select Thanos figure now this is

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.540 
select Thanos figure now this is
obviously<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.930> seven-inch<00:03:56.500> scale<00:03:56.830> figure<00:03:57.310> but

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
obviously a seven-inch scale figure but

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.400 
obviously a seven-inch scale figure but
I<00:03:57.580> like<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.090> size<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.810> figure<00:03:59.170> for

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
I like the size of this figure for

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.650 
I like the size of this figure for
Thanos<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.670> think<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:01.000> fits<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.390> well<00:04:01.600> with

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
Thanos and I think it fits in well with

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.259 
Thanos and I think it fits in well with
the<00:04:01.989> Marvel<00:04:02.350> Legends<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:04.000> know<00:04:04.090> even

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
the Marvel Legends so you know even

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.750 
the Marvel Legends so you know even
though<00:04:04.360> this<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.810> classic<00:04:05.290> costume<00:04:05.760> you

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
though this is the classic costume you

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.820 
though this is the classic costume you
know<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:06.910> think<00:04:07.180> that's<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.600> good<00:04:07.720> size<00:04:08.019> for<00:04:08.050> a

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
know I think that's a good size for a

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.720 
know I think that's a good size for a
Marvel<00:04:09.730> Legends<00:04:10.120> Thanos<00:04:10.600> or<00:04:11.160> even<00:04:12.160> that's<00:04:12.400> you

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
Marvel Legends Thanos or even that's you

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.420 
Marvel Legends Thanos or even that's you
know<00:04:12.820> maybe<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.840> last<00:04:14.560> star<00:04:14.860> figure<00:04:15.220> that

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
know maybe the last star figure that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.030 
know maybe the last star figure that
they<00:04:15.610> released<00:04:16.000> in<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.299> Thanos<00:04:16.690> imperative

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
they released in that Thanos imperative

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.280 
they released in that Thanos imperative
San<00:04:18.040> Diego<00:04:18.370> comic-con<00:04:18.729> box<00:04:19.120> set<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.930> would

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
San Diego comic-con box set that would

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.080 
San Diego comic-con box set that would
probably<00:04:20.440> be<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.769> good<00:04:21.010> size<00:04:21.220> for<00:04:21.250> Thanos<00:04:21.910> as

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
probably be a good size for Thanos as

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.080 
probably be a good size for Thanos as
well<00:04:22.380> but<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.590> see<00:04:23.919> that<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.550> the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
well but you can see that the the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.340 
well but you can see that the the
stano's<00:04:25.539> build<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.840> figure<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.169> actually

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
stano's build a figure is actually

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.090 
stano's build a figure is actually
shorter

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
shorter

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.480 
shorter
than<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.610> blasts<00:04:27.880> are<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:29.710> articulation<00:04:30.370> on

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
than the blasts are so articulation on

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.520 
than the blasts are so articulation on
this<00:04:30.670> figure<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.120> not<00:04:31.270> too<00:04:31.510> bad

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
this figure is not too bad

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.740 
this figure is not too bad
heads<00:04:32.890> on<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.130> ball<00:04:33.400> hinge<00:04:33.700> joint<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.420> he<00:04:34.600> can

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
heads on a ball hinge joint so he can

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.970 
heads on a ball hinge joint so he can
look<00:04:34.900> left<00:04:35.170> and<00:04:35.590> right<00:04:36.340> with<00:04:36.610> no<00:04:36.760> problem<00:04:37.980> he's

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
look left and right with no problem he's

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.220

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
got it's a ball hinge joint so he's got

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.650 
got it's a ball hinge joint so he's got
some<00:04:41.260> up-and-down<00:04:41.920> movement<00:04:42.520> not<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.420> whole

and he can look up some he's got a waist
swivel<00:05:38.640> it's<00:05:39.640> a<00:05:39.730> good<00:05:39.940> movement<00:05:40.180> there<00:05:41.670> this

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
swivel it's a good movement there this

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.970 
swivel it's a good movement there this
this<00:05:43.180> waist<00:05:43.600> piece<00:05:43.990> is<00:05:44.260> actually<00:05:44.410> a<00:05:44.620> separate

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
this waist piece is actually a separate

this waist piece is actually a separate
piece<00:05:45.190> from<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.490> figure<00:05:45.730> it's<00:05:45.880> not<00:05:46.000> really

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
piece from the figure it's not really

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.140 
piece from the figure it's not really
meant<00:05:46.480> to<00:05:46.540> be<00:05:46.720> removable<00:05:47.200> but<00:05:48.070> because<00:05:48.880> it<00:05:49.030> is

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
meant to be removable but because it is

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.730 
meant to be removable but because it is
a<00:05:49.180> separate<00:05:49.630> piece<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.110> it's<00:05:50.230> kind<00:05:50.410> of<00:05:50.440> a<00:05:50.530> hard

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
a separate piece and it's kind of a hard

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.610 
a separate piece and it's kind of a hard
plastic<00:05:50.850> it<00:05:51.850> does<00:05:52.150> limit<00:05:52.780> his<00:05:52.990> movement<00:05:53.470> of

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
plastic it does limit his movement of

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.980 
plastic it does limit his movement of
his<00:05:53.740> legs<00:05:54.070> to<00:05:54.580> some<00:05:54.760> extent<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:55.690> he<00:05:55.780> can<00:05:55.900> only

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
his legs to some extent so he can only

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.320 
his legs to some extent so he can only
get<00:05:56.230> his<00:05:56.350> leg<00:05:56.590> forward<00:05:57.160> about<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.640> much<00:05:57.910> and

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
get his leg forward about that much and

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.740 
get his leg forward about that much and
then<00:05:59.050> he<00:05:59.350> can't<00:05:59.590> get<00:06:00.010> his<00:06:00.160> leg<00:06:00.310> back<00:06:00.640> much<00:06:01.420> at

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
then he can't get his leg back much at

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
taller but other than that I think it's

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.120 
taller but other than that I think it's
a<00:06:31.510> nice<00:06:31.660> looking<00:06:31.990> figure<00:06:32.260> I'm<00:06:32.620> glad<00:06:32.830> that<00:06:32.980> we

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.530 
finally got a Marvel legend stano's
figure<00:06:35.260> even<00:06:35.740> though<00:06:36.040> I<00:06:36.070> still<00:06:36.460> really<00:06:37.300> like

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
figure even though I still really like

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.020 
figure even though I still really like
that<00:06:37.780> diamond<00:06:38.260> select<00:06:38.680> Thanos

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
that diamond select Thanos

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.730 
that diamond select Thanos
but<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.449> good<00:06:40.599> thing<00:06:40.780> is<00:06:40.990> is<00:06:41.259> you<00:06:41.439> know<00:06:41.530> that's

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
but the good thing is is you know that's

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.649 
but the good thing is is you know that's
the<00:06:41.889> classic<00:06:42.340> costume<00:06:42.550> and<00:06:43.180> this<00:06:43.330> is<00:06:43.539> the

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
the classic costume and this is the

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.390 
the classic costume and this is the
modern<00:06:43.840> costume<00:06:44.469> so<00:06:44.710> you<00:06:44.770> kind<00:06:45.009> of<00:06:45.039> get<00:06:45.189> both

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
modern costume so you kind of get both

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.760 
modern costume so you kind of get both
costumes<00:06:46.000> which<00:06:46.240> I<00:06:46.360> like<00:06:46.539> I<00:06:46.750> like<00:06:47.110> Hasbro<00:06:47.590> went

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
costumes which I like I like Hasbro went

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.469 
costumes which I like I like Hasbro went
with<00:06:47.919> the<00:06:48.009> more<00:06:48.189> modern<00:06:48.490> costume<00:06:49.030> as<00:06:49.180> opposed

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
with the more modern costume as opposed

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.510 
with the more modern costume as opposed
to<00:06:49.569> the<00:06:49.719> classic<00:06:50.169> one<00:06:50.349> since<00:06:50.650> I<00:06:50.889> think<00:06:51.370> that

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
to the classic one since I think that

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.659 
to the classic one since I think that
diamond<00:06:51.939> select<00:06:52.300> Marvel<00:06:52.780> Select<00:06:53.669> figures

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
diamond select Marvel Select figures

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.540 
diamond select Marvel Select figures
