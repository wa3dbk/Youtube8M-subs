00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
alright guys ok so now we are going to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.040 
alright guys ok so now we are going to
see<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:06.080> LED<00:00:07.080> light<00:00:07.350> so<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.280> bio<00:00:08.550> disc

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
see this LED light so this is bio disc

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.799 
see this LED light so this is bio disc
counter-clock<00:00:10.050> LED<00:00:10.889> light<00:00:11.130> high<00:00:11.700> insulin<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
counter-clock LED light high insulin and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.079 
counter-clock LED light high insulin and
how<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.710> works<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.219> see<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
how it works you can see that this is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.529 
how it works you can see that this is
rechargeable<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.310> this<00:00:17.310> actually<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> inside

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
rechargeable so this actually the inside

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.000 
rechargeable so this actually the inside
battery<00:00:18.930> would<00:00:19.080> last<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.590> least<00:00:19.710> 4<00:00:19.980> hours

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
battery would last for at least 4 hours

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
battery would last for at least 4 hours
if<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.939> keep<00:00:21.180> running<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.779> 4<00:00:21.930> hours<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
if you keep running it for 4 hours and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.890 
if you keep running it for 4 hours and
this<00:00:23.250> push<00:00:23.550> button<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:23.970> basically<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> turn<00:00:24.750> it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
this push button is basically to turn it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
this push button is basically to turn it
on<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> there<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:25.949> six<00:00:26.189> different<00:00:26.369> functions

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
on and there are six different functions

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
on and there are six different functions
you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.480> control<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.080> speed<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:29.010> can<00:00:29.189> also

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you can control this speed you can also

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.090 
you can control this speed you can also
control<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:31.940> direction<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.890> then<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
control the direction and then this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
control the direction and then this
basically<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> instructions<00:00:36.660> are

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
basically all the instructions are

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.119 
basically all the instructions are
already<00:00:37.079> within<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.980> just

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
already within here so you can just

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.690 
already within here so you can just
follow<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.680> press<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.520> three

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
follow and if you press it for three

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.440 
follow and if you press it for three
seconds<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:42.870> basically<00:00:43.370> start<00:00:44.450> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
seconds then it will basically start the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.560 
seconds then it will basically start the
LED<00:00:45.989> light<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.250> feed<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.149> simple

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
LED light so to feed it it's very simple

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.619 
LED light so to feed it it's very simple
all<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.420> that

all you have to do is you can see that
this<00:00:51.780> particular<00:00:52.020> cover<00:00:52.469> comes<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.239> bio

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this particular cover comes with the bio

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
this particular cover comes with the bio
disc<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.500> let's<00:00:56.160> open<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.440> all<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
disc so let's open it and all we have to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.900 
disc so let's open it and all we have to
do<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.699> put<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:01.010> bio<00:01:02.010> disc<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
do is just put this bio disc here and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.700 
do is just put this bio disc here and
now<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.350> cover<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.890> back<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.710> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
now you can cover it back and it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
now you can cover it back and it's
pretty<00:01:07.979> straightforward<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.090> simple

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
pretty straightforward and simple

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.380 
pretty straightforward and simple
procedure<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> once<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.520> put<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.150> like

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
procedure and once you put it back like

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.830 
procedure and once you put it back like
this<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.350> turn<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.810> can

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
this now you just turn it on and you can

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.039 
this now you just turn it on and you can
see<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.970> LED<00:01:17.970> light<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.390> rotating<00:01:18.900> now

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
see that this LED light is rotating now

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.340 
see that this LED light is rotating now
from<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.490> looks<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.900> counter

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
from here it looks like it's in counter

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
from here it looks like it's in counter
clock<00:01:22.619> direction<00:01:23.060> it's<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.299> clockwise

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
clock direction it's in clockwise

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.960 
clock direction it's in clockwise
direction<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> put<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.700> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
direction but if you put it like this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580 
direction but if you put it like this
then<00:01:27.450> only<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
then only you can see that it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
then only you can see that it's
anti-clockwise<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
anti-clockwise and that's how we have to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.310 
anti-clockwise and that's how we have to
save<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.869> let's<00:01:34.140> see

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
save so if they can so now let's see

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.940 
save so if they can so now let's see
music<00:01:34.829> okay<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
music okay so now I put it like this you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.870 
music okay so now I put it like this you
can<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.990> rotating<00:01:39.990> an<00:01:40.110> empty

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
can see that it's rotating an empty

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
can see that it's rotating an empty
counterclockwise<00:01:41.880> direction<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
counterclockwise direction and this is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
counterclockwise direction and this is
how<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.470> will<00:01:43.799> put<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.790> muscles<00:01:45.210> or

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
how you will put it on your muscles or

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.610 
how you will put it on your muscles or
your<00:01:45.750> skin<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.070> body<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
your skin on the body and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.340 
your skin on the body and
you<00:01:48.890> can<00:01:49.040> keep<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.370> this<00:01:49.490> way<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:50.900> can<00:01:51.080> see

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
you can keep it this way and you can see

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.480 
you can keep it this way and you can see
that<00:01:52.090> okay<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.570> anything<00:01:54.260> so<00:01:54.920> let's<00:01:55.190> say<00:01:55.310> for
