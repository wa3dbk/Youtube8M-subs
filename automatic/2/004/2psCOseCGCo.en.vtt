hi the Mobius is a nice and capable
little<00:00:05.140> action<00:00:05.529> cam<00:00:05.770> that<00:00:05.950> can<00:00:06.100> also<00:00:06.250> be<00:00:06.460> used

Mobius features a small sensor with a

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.910 
Mobius features a small sensor with a
limited<00:00:12.550> dynamic<00:00:12.760> range<00:00:13.380> when<00:00:14.380> you<00:00:14.500> combine

limited dynamic range when you combine

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.919 
limited dynamic range when you combine
that<00:00:14.950> with<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.400> automatic<00:00:15.760> exposure<00:00:16.359> there

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:16.929 
that with the automatic exposure there

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.960 
that with the automatic exposure there
are<00:00:17.080> many<00:00:17.320> situations<00:00:17.650> when<00:00:18.369> your<00:00:18.580> camera

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
are many situations when your camera

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.120 
are many situations when your camera
struggles<00:00:19.480> to<00:00:19.720> expose<00:00:20.109> bright<00:00:20.470> skies<00:00:20.830> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
struggles to expose bright skies and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.970 
struggles to expose bright skies and
dark<00:00:21.369> foregrounds<00:00:22.179> at<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.449> same<00:00:22.660> time<00:00:23.050> you

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
dark foregrounds at the same time you

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.009 
dark foregrounds at the same time you
can<00:00:24.160> see<00:00:24.369> in<00:00:24.579> that<00:00:24.609> example<00:00:25.179> that<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.749> sky<00:00:25.990> is

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
can see in that example that the sky is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.870 
can see in that example that the sky is
very<00:00:26.439> bright<00:00:26.769> on<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:26.980> right<00:00:27.249> side<00:00:27.609> of<00:00:27.789> the

is underexposed this is because the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.590 
is underexposed this is because the
