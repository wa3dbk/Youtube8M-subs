it's<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> keep<00:01:45.090> fighting<00:01:45.330> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570

in the year I think it's just us
settling<00:02:17.820> into<00:02:18.120> our<00:02:18.239> roles<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.290> all

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
settling into our roles and and we all

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.410 
settling into our roles and and we all
knowing<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.550> come<00:02:21.000> together<00:02:21.150> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
knowing that we have to come together to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.650 
knowing that we have to come together to
win<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.940> just

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
win in and that we have to just just

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.150 
win in and that we have to just just
just<00:02:25.019> be<00:02:25.200> together<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:25.830> not<00:02:25.950> really

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
just be together and it's not really

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.180 
just be together and it's not really
about<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.880> happens<00:02:27.830> individually<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:28.860> just

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
