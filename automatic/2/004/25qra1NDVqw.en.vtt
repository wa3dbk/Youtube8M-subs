00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.120 
didn't do that is I've been busy so
maybe<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.540> should<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.139> took<00:00:16.289> taken<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.949> back

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
maybe I should have took taken that back

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
maybe I should have took taken that back
i<00:00:17.160> will<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.670> uploading<00:00:17.850> videos<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> can

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
i will be uploading videos when I can

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.890 
i will be uploading videos when I can
and<00:00:19.170> when<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> feel<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> it'll<00:00:21.869> be

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and when I feel like it and so it'll be

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.769 
and when I feel like it and so it'll be
pretty<00:00:22.590> frequently<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.420> guess<00:00:24.420> we'll<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
pretty frequently I guess we'll have to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.080 
pretty frequently I guess we'll have to
see<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.160> depends<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> mood<00:00:26.880> i'm<00:00:26.910> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
into the first thing which is tools

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.370 
into the first thing which is tools
which<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.610> created<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.060> were<00:02:00.119> about

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
which can be created they were about

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.830 
which can be created they were about
just<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.500> powerful<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:02.070> dymond<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> seems<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
just as powerful as dymond it seems the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.830 
just as powerful as dymond it seems the
durability<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.579> but

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
durability I don't really know but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.999 
durability I don't really know but
anyways<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.990> definitely<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> good<00:02:07.799> amount

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
anyways that definitely is a good amount

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.760 
anyways that definitely is a good amount
I'm<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> make<00:02:08.849> the

Endermen can't be don't come after you
well<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.740> exactly<00:03:32.130> what<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.520> is<00:03:32.550> supposed

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
well this is exactly what it is supposed

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.130 
well this is exactly what it is supposed
to<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.210> not<00:03:33.390> currently<00:03:33.870> working

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
to do it is not currently working

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.630 
to do it is not currently working
hopefully<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.040> will<00:03:35.130> get<00:03:35.250> fixed<00:03:35.490> soon

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
hopefully this will get fixed soon

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.490 
hopefully this will get fixed soon
because<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.480> would<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.260> awesome

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
because this would be a really awesome

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.250 
because this would be a really awesome
function<00:03:38.040> even<00:03:38.760> if<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.360> ender<00:03:39.540> pearl<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:40.020> used

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
function even if the ender pearl is used

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.900 
function even if the ender pearl is used
for<00:03:40.440> teleportation<00:03:40.800> which<00:03:41.280> I'm<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.700> sure<00:03:41.850> if

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
for teleportation which I'm not sure if

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.850 
for teleportation which I'm not sure if
you<00:03:41.970> guys<00:03:42.060> knew<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.990> what<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.830> is

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
you guys knew that that is what it is

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.770 
you guys knew that that is what it is
going<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.280> used<00:03:44.490> for<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:45.270> would<00:03:45.420> still<00:03:45.660> be

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
going to be used for that would still be

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.660 
going to be used for that would still be
an<00:03:45.870> awesome<00:03:46.020> thing<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.440> make<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.890> l<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.400> your

quick very quick actually so definitely
a<00:03:57.150> good<00:03:57.570> thing<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.780> tools<00:03:57.990> i'm<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.350> go

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
let's go over here and I'll just chop

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.320 
let's go over here and I'll just chop
some<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.250> one<00:04:05.400> I'm<00:04:05.520> getting<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.820> little<00:04:06.030> bit<00:04:06.240> of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
some the one I'm getting a little bit of

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.380 
some the one I'm getting a little bit of
lag<00:04:06.480> i'm<00:04:06.630> not<00:04:06.780> too<00:04:06.990> sure<00:04:07.020> why<00:04:07.910> be<00:04:08.910> i'm<00:04:09.090> trying

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
lag i'm not too sure why be i'm trying

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.810 
lag i'm not too sure why be i'm trying
out<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> new<00:04:09.630> screen<00:04:10.200> capture<00:04:10.620> which<00:04:11.280> hopefully

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
out a new screen capture which hopefully

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.220 
out a new screen capture which hopefully
will<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.090> pretty<00:04:12.360> good<00:04:12.540> as<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.990> can<00:04:13.080> see

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
will be pretty good as you can see

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.720 
will be pretty good as you can see
that's<00:04:13.410> really<00:04:13.920> fast<00:04:14.130> with<00:04:14.340> chopping<00:04:14.640> down

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
that's really fast with chopping down

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.900 
that's really fast with chopping down
the<00:04:14.790> wood<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.890> all<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.130> all<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.250> think<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.729> this

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the wood so all in all I think that this

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.760 
the wood so all in all I think that this
mod<00:04:18.210> is<00:04:18.239> definitely<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.200> good<00:04:19.290> addition<00:04:19.500> if

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770
