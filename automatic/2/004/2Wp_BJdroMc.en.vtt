00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.020
 you are studying rollers well today 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.910
 let's do a study for 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.449
 improve further 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.600
 execution of this technique 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:22.240
 precisely I invite you to study 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.609
 sequences of shots both in the environment 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.919
 track in a thermal environment 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.730
 let me explain better in a binary environment yes 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.340
 is about executing sequences of 2 4 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.180
 and 8 ie all visible numbers for 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.790
 two therefore binary environment precisely 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.340
 we'll play two hits per click of the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.410
 in this case we will play the metronome 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.270
 chrome and the eighths 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.480
 four sixteenth rounds and sixteenths 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.230
 eight rounds for each click the 32nds 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:03.220
 so-called b sows it is appropriate to learn 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.910
 to go from two to 448 and from 8 to 4 and 4 to 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.600
 2 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.250
 learn also to decelerate then 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.250
 learn to control the rebound 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.860
 now I repeat the sequence using the 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 technique of doubtful strokes of the 2 role 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.740
 now let's move on to the ternary environment 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.229
 instead studying the eighth note triplets of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.289
 chrome and the six groups of six 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 sixteenth notes, then I will perform 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.269
 triplets and sestines triplets and sestina 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.680
 the same thing we repeat with blows 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.950
 double rollers at 2 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.870
 I point out to you though that when we do the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.690
 octave triplet the pulse of 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.660
 metronome the second beat of the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:52.490
 metronome ends up on the second shot 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:56.620
 left and the other pulse on 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.620
 second shot of the right then 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.760
 remember this thing because otherwise 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.050
 you can't synchronize them 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.050
 correctly with the metronome 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:29.400
 now after studying these sequences is 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.409
 It is advisable to combine the ternary environment with 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.849
 the binary environment then study one 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:39.150
 sequence of 22 then of eighths of 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:43.829
 triplets of chrome and quadruplets of 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.640
 sixteenth note sixteenth notes of 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:56.690
 groups of 8 bis chrome and then study 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:56.690
 sequences of 24 or better 2 3 4 6 8 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.590
 at this point see you next time 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.920
 bet 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.920
 Hello
