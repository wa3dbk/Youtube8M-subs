the<00:00:27.689> most<00:00:27.869> common<00:00:28.260> misuse<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.680> Vet<00:00:29.010> Wrap<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the most common misuse of Vet Wrap is to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.279 
the most common misuse of Vet Wrap is to
use<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.090> without<00:00:30.150> sufficient<00:00:30.539> padding

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
use it without sufficient padding

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
use it without sufficient padding
underneath<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.579> happen<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.270> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
underneath what can happen is that it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.030 
underneath what can happen is that it
can<00:00:33.480> cut<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.750> circulation<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.559> distal

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
can cut up circulation to the distal

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
can cut up circulation to the distal

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
place the next layer we're going to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
place the next layer we're going to
apply<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.009> our<00:01:23.340> padded<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.630> I'm

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
apply is our padded there so I'm

applying the padding from the car and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.410 
applying the padding from the car and
rebound<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> cannon<00:01:29.009> boom

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
rebound all the way up the cannon boom

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.490 
rebound all the way up the cannon boom
making<00:01:30.420> sure<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.900> even<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> not

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
making sure that it's even and not

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
making sure that it's even and not
scrunched<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.220> anywhere<00:01:32.700> they're<00:01:33.479> not

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
scrunched up anywhere they're not

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
scrunched up anywhere they're not
putting<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.079> tight<00:01:34.439> I'm<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.890> placing<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
putting on tight I'm just placing it the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.280 
putting on tight I'm just placing it the
next<00:01:36.030> layer<00:01:36.150> we're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.659> apply<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:36.990> our

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
next layer we're going to apply is our

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
next layer we're going to apply is our
brown<00:01:37.530> goals<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.880> does<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
brown goals so what this does is to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.410 
brown goals so what this does is to
secure<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.409> Kombi<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> place<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:42.119> want<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
secure the Kombi in place you want to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.230 
secure the Kombi in place you want to
pull<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.079> your<00:01:43.140> dorsal<00:01:43.979> surface<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.759> wrap

pull on your dorsal surface and wrap
around<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.140> flexor<00:01:46.530> tendon<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> most

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
around your flexor tendon so the most

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.460 
around your flexor tendon so the most
important<00:01:48.299> thing<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.659> remember<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> apply

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
important thing to remember is to apply

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
important thing to remember is to apply
even<00:01:49.799> pressure<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.520> whole<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:50.820> around<00:01:50.939> the

even pressure the whole way around the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.740 
even pressure the whole way around the
leg<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.259> down<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:54.149> ensure<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
leg up and down to ensure that the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.380 
leg up and down to ensure that the
bandage<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> secure<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> next<00:01:57.030> year<00:01:57.240> we're

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
bandage is secure so the next year we're

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.460 
bandage is secure so the next year we're
going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> apply<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.930> our<00:01:58.200> vet<00:01:58.380> wrapped<00:01:58.680> there

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
so you can see that I'm pulling out

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.400 
so you can see that I'm pulling out
enough<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.330> remove<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> crinkles<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.320> are

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
enough to remove the crinkles that are

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.050 
enough to remove the crinkles that are
in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.620> back<00:02:04.800> wrap<00:02:04.980> but<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.550> not<00:02:05.670> putting<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
again the most important thing is to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
again the most important thing is to
apply<00:02:13.980> even<00:02:14.220> pressure<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:15.060> you're<00:02:15.510> applying
