the cello does she ever stop playing

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.490 
the cello does she ever stop playing
depends<00:05:50.880> on<00:05:51.000> her<00:05:51.090> mood<00:05:51.120> when<00:05:51.960> she's<00:05:52.139> really

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.140 
depends on her mood when she's really
really<00:05:52.680> down<00:05:53.010> I'll<00:05:53.310> bet<00:05:53.550> if<00:05:53.639> they<00:05:53.760> didn't<00:05:54.030> give

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
really down I'll bet if they didn't give

really down I'll bet if they didn't give
demerits<00:05:54.630> for<00:05:54.690> making<00:05:55.050> noise<00:05:55.169> after<00:05:55.440> hours
