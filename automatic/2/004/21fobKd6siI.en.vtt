hang<00:02:57.510> out<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.200> edges<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:59.180> actually<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
hang out at the edges and actually the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.589 
hang out at the edges and actually the
cards<00:03:00.870> still<00:03:01.230> are<00:03:01.950> very<00:03:02.340> secure<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.269> I

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
cards still are very secure and I

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.170 
cards still are very secure and I
decided<00:03:04.019> when<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.489> together<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
decided when I put this together that I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.380 
decided when I put this together that I
would<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.959> roll<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.590> tall<00:03:07.950> cards<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.670> then<00:03:09.060> a

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
would do a roll of tall cards and then a

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.110 
would do a roll of tall cards and then a
row<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.720> long<00:03:09.930> cards<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.739> row<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.400> tall<00:03:11.640> cards

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
row of long cards a row of tall cards

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
row of long cards a row of tall cards
and<00:03:12.329> then<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> row<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.810> long<00:03:13.019> cards<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.769> seems

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and then a row of long cards it seems

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.490 
and then a row of long cards it seems
like<00:03:14.430> when<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:14.819> swapping<00:03:15.209> oh<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.079> then<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> row

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
like when I'm swapping oh and then a row

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500 
like when I'm swapping oh and then a row
of<00:03:16.530> tall<00:03:16.890> cards<00:03:17.250> down<00:03:17.400> at<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.670> bottom<00:03:18.030> but

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
of tall cards down at the bottom but

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.210 
of tall cards down at the bottom but
when<00:03:18.569> I'm<00:03:18.810> swapping<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.500> seems<00:03:19.859> like<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.160> get

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
when I'm swapping it seems like I get

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.190 
when I'm swapping it seems like I get
more<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> tall<00:03:21.120> cards<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.079> don't

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
more of the tall cards and so I don't

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.860 
more of the tall cards and so I don't
need<00:03:22.530> quite<00:03:22.890> as<00:03:23.160> much<00:03:23.190> room<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.849> display<00:03:24.569> all

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
need quite as much room to display all

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.729 
need quite as much room to display all
of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> long<00:03:25.530> cards<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:28.139> is<00:03:28.349> what<00:03:28.560> I

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
of the long cards and so this is what I

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.210 
of the long cards and so this is what I
am<00:03:29.250> doing<00:03:29.609> now<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.010> a

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.150 
so well the first thing that I did is I
put<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.690> cards<00:04:04.079> down<00:04:04.169> exactly<00:04:04.859> where<00:04:05.129> I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
put the cards down exactly where I

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.640 
put the cards down exactly where I
wanted<00:04:05.730> them<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.419> for<00:04:06.569> example<00:04:07.109> in<00:04:07.230> my<00:04:07.379> long

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
wanted them so for example in my long

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.729 
wanted them so for example in my long
roll<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:09.000> my<00:04:09.389> card<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.260> then<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.379> have<00:04:10.709> a

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
roll I have my card and then I have a

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.909 
roll I have my card and then I have a
clothespin<00:04:11.519> attached<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.959> so

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
clothespin attached to it and so

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.129 
clothespin attached to it and so
basically<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.669> laid<00:04:15.120> all<00:04:15.359> my<00:04:15.540> cards<00:04:15.930> down

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
basically I laid all my cards down

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.800 
basically I laid all my cards down
exactly<00:04:16.680> where<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:16.950> wanted<00:04:17.340> them<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.579> be<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.239> I

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
exactly where I wanted them to be and I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.469 
exactly where I wanted them to be and I
also<00:04:18.989> put<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.380> clothes<00:04:19.709> pins<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.239> card

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
also put the clothes pins on to the card

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.060 
also put the clothes pins on to the card
when<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.750> was<00:04:21.989> putting<00:04:22.289> them<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.830> board

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
when I was putting them on the board

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.040 
when I was putting them on the board
just<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.789> would<00:04:23.970> know<00:04:24.210> what<00:04:24.840> my

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
just so that I would know what my

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.650 
just so that I would know what my
spacing<00:04:25.440> needed<00:04:25.949> to<00:04:26.099> be<00:04:26.250> once<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.120> had<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
spacing needed to be once I had the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.600 
spacing needed to be once I had the
cards<00:04:28.050> exactly<00:04:28.590> where<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.740> wanted<00:04:29.099> them<00:04:29.280> on<00:04:29.310> my

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
cards exactly where I wanted them on my

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.730 
cards exactly where I wanted them on my
board<00:04:29.909> then<00:04:30.539> it<00:04:30.719> was<00:04:30.840> just<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.169> matter<00:04:31.409> of

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
board then it was just a matter of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.239 
board then it was just a matter of
flipping<00:04:32.039> them<00:04:32.400> over<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.919> adhering

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:35.249 
flipping them over and adhering

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.769 
flipping them over and adhering
that<00:04:35.459> the<00:04:36.419> Terran<00:04:36.929> tape<00:04:37.249> so<00:04:38.249> I<00:04:38.729> am<00:04:38.999> I<00:04:39.269> am<00:04:39.539> just

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:39.779 
that the Terran tape so I am I am just

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.869 
that the Terran tape so I am I am just
putting<00:04:39.989> this<00:04:40.289> tape<00:04:40.649> onto<00:04:41.249> the<00:04:41.369> back<00:04:41.549> of<00:04:41.579> the

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
putting this tape onto the back of the

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.269 
putting this tape onto the back of the
clothespin<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.779> then<00:04:43.289> just<00:04:43.559> cutting<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.099> off

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:44.279

and here it to the back of the
clothespin<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.749> snip<00:04:51.749> it<00:04:51.779> and<00:04:52.199> then<00:04:52.889> one<00:04:53.219> more

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:53.459 
clothespin and snip it and then one more

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
your board and so I'm putting this one

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.079 
your board and so I'm putting this one
right<00:05:17.849> here<00:05:18.479> making<00:05:19.289> sure<00:05:19.499> that<00:05:19.829> I<00:05:19.889> have<00:05:20.249> the

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.089 
right here making sure that I have the

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.409 
right here making sure that I have the
bottom<00:05:21.449> all<00:05:21.659> lined<00:05:21.989> up<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:23.729> then<00:05:23.879> I<00:05:23.969> can<00:05:24.029> just

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
bottom all lined up and then I can just

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.350 
bottom all lined up and then I can just
press<00:05:24.719> it<00:05:24.959> right<00:05:25.199> on<00:05:25.469> to<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.610> board<00:05:26.909> and<00:05:27.149> that

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
press it right on to the board and that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.929 
press it right on to the board and that
is<00:05:27.539> on<00:05:27.749> there<00:05:27.959> very<00:05:27.989> very<00:05:28.349> securely<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.279> the

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
is on there very very securely and the

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.389 
is on there very very securely and the
reason<00:05:30.329> I<00:05:30.419> know<00:05:30.479> this<00:05:30.659> is<00:05:31.169> because<00:05:31.589> once<00:05:31.889> I<00:05:32.129> had

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:32.399 
reason I know this is because once I had

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.509 
reason I know this is because once I had
put<00:05:32.699> a<00:05:32.879> clothespin<00:05:33.479> down<00:05:33.779> and<00:05:34.169> thought<00:05:35.129> I<00:05:35.159> had

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:35.519 
put a clothespin down and thought I had

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:37.429 
put a clothespin down and thought I had
it<00:05:35.549> where<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:35.819> wanted<00:05:36.299> it<00:05:36.419> but<00:05:36.629> then<00:05:36.809> realized<00:05:37.229> I

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:37.439 
it where I wanted it but then realized I

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.739 
it where I wanted it but then realized I
was<00:05:37.559> a<00:05:37.589> little<00:05:37.859> bit<00:05:38.009> off<00:05:38.219> so<00:05:38.999> I<00:05:39.059> tried<00:05:39.389> to<00:05:39.419> take

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:39.749 
was a little bit off so I tried to take

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.319 
was a little bit off so I tried to take
it<00:05:39.779> up<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.979> but<00:05:41.489> because<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:41.879> had<00:05:42.179> already

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:42.329 
it up and but because I had already

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:46.309 
it up and but because I had already
burnished<00:05:43.079> it<00:05:43.349> down<00:05:43.649> I<00:05:44.089> was<00:05:45.089> not<00:05:45.269> able<00:05:45.629> to<00:05:45.869> get

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
burnished it down I was not able to get

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.739 
burnished it down I was not able to get
it<00:05:46.469> up<00:05:46.709> and<00:05:47.039> it<00:05:47.129> actually<00:05:47.339> tore<00:05:47.879> my<00:05:48.089> board<00:05:48.419> and

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:48.749 
it up and it actually tore my board and

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.859 
it up and it actually tore my board and
so<00:05:49.379> this<00:05:49.559> is<00:05:49.829> on<00:05:50.129> there<00:05:50.519> pretty<00:05:50.789> good<00:05:50.879> so<00:05:51.719> now

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:51.869 
so this is on there pretty good so now

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.350 
so this is on there pretty good so now
I'm<00:05:52.019> just<00:05:52.199> putting<00:05:52.409> these<00:05:52.679> down<00:05:53.149> I'm<00:05:54.149> just

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
I'm just putting these down I'm just

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.969 
I'm just putting these down I'm just
making<00:05:54.659> sure<00:05:54.719> that<00:05:55.049> I<00:05:55.079> have<00:05:55.379> them<00:05:55.529> exactly

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
making sure that I have them exactly

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.409 
making sure that I have them exactly
where<00:05:56.309> I<00:05:56.339> want<00:05:56.610> them<00:05:56.699> and<00:05:56.879> then<00:05:56.999> I<00:05:57.059> have<00:05:57.329> them

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
where I want them and then I have them

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.350 
where I want them and then I have them
lined<00:05:57.749> up<00:05:58.049> once<00:05:58.799> I<00:05:58.949> have<00:05:59.159> them<00:05:59.279> down<00:05:59.549> then<00:06:00.239> I

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
lined up once I have them down then I
