once again and of course the third Burke
is<00:01:39.889> ionic<00:01:40.490> potency<00:01:41.240> ionic<00:01:42.049> web<00:01:42.409> reacts<00:01:43.280> more

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
is ionic potency ionic web reacts more

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.029 
is ionic potency ionic web reacts more
rapidly<00:01:44.329> now<00:01:44.659> we<00:01:44.719> do<00:01:45.020> know<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.770> game

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
rapidly now we do know that in this game

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.739 
rapidly now we do know that in this game
there<00:01:46.340> will<00:01:46.459> be<00:01:46.639> a<00:01:46.670> lot<00:01:46.969> more<00:01:46.999> different

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
there will be a lot more different

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.109

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
attacks it seems that the ionic web will

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.849 
attacks it seems that the ionic web will
do<00:01:52.939> more<00:01:53.270> damage<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.020> enemies<00:01:54.380> which<00:01:54.679> is
