00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.329
 Hi all 

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:02.850
 I am day 15 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.700
 in this video tutorial I will teach you to loot your psp 3000 at the level of running 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.000
 and you are in a brief those of ps 1 and run the plugins 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.529
 but he clarified that it is not 100% sure that it will work since it is only in phase 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.859
 of test and it is not a check as the true is only provisional 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.869
 what we need is a psp 3000 with update 5 0 3 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.769
 the program for psp chicken and the program called custom firmware enabler 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.769
 both programs can download them from the description 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.950
 First of all, clarify that your PSP does not run any risk, however. 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.520
 I am not responsible for collateral damage to your psp 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.510
 well let's get started 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.010
 first of all make sure that the version of your psp is the 5 0 3 ino 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.990
 greater since if it is greater it will not work 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.530
 connect your psp to the pc with cable or sb now download the chicken program from 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.630
 the description 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.460
 there you will see two files 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.690
 these two drag them to the memory of their psp 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.000
 If you ask them to substitute the data they give you yes 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.810
 then download the custom firmware enabler and also drag it to the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.450
 memory of your psp 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.500
 now we disconnect the psp from the pc the chicken is an image with a code in 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.480
 its interior 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.570
 the psp to visualize it is restarted and is in a state without security 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.060
 in which it is possible to skip the protections of the psp and can run 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 home applications emulators and so on 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.090
 so what they will do is from the menu of your psp and the photos and open the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600
 Image with the name is cute 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.290
 once it restarts we go to the menu games and memories pib of the psp and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 we run the custom firmware enabler program 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.210
 when the program is fully opened they give the circle and then they give 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.710
 the x and wait a moment 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.799
 When the process is over, you can run games in iso and cc or run 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.210
 ps 1 games etcetera 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.630
 not if you are in the iso folder of your psp memory at the beginning if you do not 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.259
 are you creating it with your name in capital letters 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.639
 can compress the and your apps or and will weigh less 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.639
 I left the limit the video that explains it in the description 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.540
 the drawback with this simile is that whenever they turn off their psp and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.959
 they want to reload games they need to re-activate the chicken image and the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.079
 custom firmware enabler 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.459
 but nothing happens with doing it again and again 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.599
 I hope you have understood all the doubts I will answer them personally 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.379
