00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.969 

so<00:00:00.420> here's<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.719> game<00:00:00.900> called<00:00:01.140> house<00:00:01.380> living

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
so here's a game called house living

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.720 
so here's a game called house living
simulator<00:00:03.020> 2013<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.770> simulation<00:00:05.400> of

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
simulator 2013 this is a simulation of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.760 
simulator 2013 this is a simulation of
what<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.390> like<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.720> live<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.319> house<00:00:07.500> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
what it's like to live in a house and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.280 
what it's like to live in a house and
Here<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.010> am<00:00:08.099> walking<00:00:08.460> around<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.570> house<00:00:09.809> that

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
Here I am walking around this house that

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
Here I am walking around this house that
I'm<00:00:10.880> presumably<00:00:12.139> simulating<00:00:13.139> living<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.130> now

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I'm presumably simulating living in now

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
I'm presumably simulating living in now
I'm<00:00:14.820> assuming<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> game<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.809> was

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I'm assuming this is a game that was

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620 
I'm assuming this is a game that was
we're<00:00:16.440> crawling<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
we're crawling as this is a the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.050 
we're crawling as this is a the
simulation<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.369> giant

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
simulation of what it's like for a giant

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
simulation of what it's like for a giant
man-sized<00:00:21.810> snail<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:23.130> live<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> house<00:00:23.670> but

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
man-sized snail to live in the house but

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
man-sized snail to live in the house but
I'm<00:00:24.240> guessing<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.830> game<00:00:26.099> was

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
I'm guessing actually this game was

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.570 
I'm guessing actually this game was
created<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:27.480> mostly<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> homeless<00:00:29.039> audience

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
created for mostly a homeless audience

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
created for mostly a homeless audience
so<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.029> experience<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.990> thrill<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
so they can experience the thrill of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
so they can experience the thrill of
having<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.489> house<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.239> course<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> problem

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
having a house of course the problem

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
having a house of course the problem
there<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.410> people<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.520> homeless

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
there is people that are homeless

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.530 
there is people that are homeless
generally<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.530> computers<00:00:38.540> they

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
generally don't have computers they

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
generally don't have computers they
don't<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> house<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.559> hard<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> store

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
don't have a house so it's hard to store

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500 
don't have a house so it's hard to store
a<00:00:41.100> computer<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.670> they're<00:00:41.820> gonna<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
a computer if they're gonna go out and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
a computer if they're gonna go out and
spend<00:00:43.110> their<00:00:43.260> heart<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.829> hard-earned<00:00:44.370> money

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
spend their heart or hard-earned money

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.330 
spend their heart or hard-earned money
on<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.000> portable<00:00:45.629> computer<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
on a portable computer you know it's it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.180 
on a portable computer you know it's it
seems<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> waste<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> buy<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
seems like a waste of time just to buy a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.790 
seems like a waste of time just to buy a
computer<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.620> an

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
one of those futuristic keyboards I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
one of those futuristic keyboards I
heard<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.520> where<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.840> keyboard<00:01:22.080> only

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
heard about where the keyboard only

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.609 
heard about where the keyboard only
actually<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.970> seven<00:01:24.360> buttons<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.200> 1<00:01:25.409> 2

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to focus more on the actual gameplay

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.690

there's<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.870> TV<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.560> think<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.819> black

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
there's the TV I think it's just a black

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.260 
there's the TV I think it's just a black
void<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> TV<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:27.120> apparently

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
void but it is a TV and now apparently

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.990 
void but it is a TV and now apparently
this<00:02:27.840> snail<00:02:28.140> has<00:02:28.650> two<00:02:29.220> pillows<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.910> I'm

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
this snail has two pillows so I'm

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.670 
this snail has two pillows so I'm
assuming<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.420> snail<00:02:30.660> lives<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:31.140> someone<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
assuming the snail lives with someone I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.470 
assuming the snail lives with someone I
wonder<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.610> snail<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.360> an

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
wonder if the snail is in like an

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.390 
wonder if the snail is in like an
interspecies<00:02:34.140> relationship<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> human

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
I hope not like where how would a human

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.880 
I hope not like where how would a human
have<00:02:38.730> sex<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> giant<00:02:39.660> snail<00:02:39.900> whatever

can fly and that's also the strength of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.460 
can fly and that's also the strength of
a<00:03:10.319> line<00:03:10.560> um<00:03:11.310> there's<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.030> toilet<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:13.350> the

a line um there's a toilet and is the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.500 
a line um there's a toilet and is the
