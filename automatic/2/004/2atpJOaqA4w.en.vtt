00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 aperture is a device in the lens 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.429
 which consists of several so 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.460
 called lamellas yes that is 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.710
 metal plates here have their 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 position they can 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.039
 that's the way to block the hole 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 objective and accordingly me 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 the position of these curtain chick we can 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.519
 adjust the amount of light that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 we pass through the lens to the matrix 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:39.790
 that is more or less light good 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:47.310
 to the training chamber 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.310
 your questions for my lunch in general all. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.500
 the diaphragm is measured in values ff. 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.539
 this is a f-number to it 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 it is necessary to calculate the focal length 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.189
 Lens divided by effective 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.210
 diaphragm diameter that is if we have 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.320
 for example a 50mm lens and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.340
 his diaphragm is completely open 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.710
 standing for example 14 then effective 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.320
 diameter will be equal to 50 millimeters 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.320
 divided by 1 and 4 that is, it will be 35 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.410
 if we take another example for example 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.790
 one hundred thirty five millimeters 20 and 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.860
 then the effective diameter in this case 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.860
 will be 135 divided by 2 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.260
 diaphragm numbers change with 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.220
 a certain step 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.080
 as you may have noticed this 1420 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.020
 this is either a list you need to understand that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.330
 every next aperture value 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.030
 reduces or increases the amount of 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.740
 light entering two massed 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 beats 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.550
 between these values ​​can be 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.880
 intermediate value it will be 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.340
 depend on the design of your rot and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.080
 alphabet dot com 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.420
 that is, well, or roughly speaking, that 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.170
 don't bother much yes you should 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 understand the first is as we said already 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.489
 regulates the amount of light which 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.050
 gets into the lens and the second is 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.370
 artistic tool that can 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.360
 manage them c sharply portrayed 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.480
 spaces that is if we have 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.730
 diaphragm as open as possible 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.580
 then the border itself is sharply depicted 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.190
 spaces with very 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.660
 the more we stifle diaphragm topic 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.450
 us this border is sharply portrayed 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.519
 spaces further warm up the mushroom and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.019
 again where if you saw our friend article 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.680
 about very often used is 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.610
 reduction 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 mushrooms clamping the diaphragm we can 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.180
 increase the flu that is how it works 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.650
 when we shoot for example let portrait 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.710
 we always try to open the diaphragm 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.770
 to isolate the shape being removed from 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.450
 forms to highlight composite won 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.360
 and pictures so that we do not distract you 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.490
 open the aperture the background is blurred if 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.070
 for example you are shooting a landscape but vice versa 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.920
 the diaphragm needs to be clamped so that we have there 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.030
 let's say 1 medium distant background backgrounds 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.840
 parts of the image were all tie-ins 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.290
 principle 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.379
 as a tool that ends it 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 the diaphragm there is such advice to us and the world is not 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.879
 shoot at fully open apertures 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.280
 which lens do you shoot that 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.159
 for example, all the fast fixes themselves 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.060
 very often at the maximum open 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.720
 the diaphragms start there halos some 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.280
 near objects near bright areas 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.980
 sharply with him is very high with such 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.290
 open apertures me for example 1 and 4 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.819
 if i will shoot in backlight he 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.040
 there will be a lot of hares to catch and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.099
 the picture will be so very low 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.750
 contrast but this must be taken into account I can 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.609
 it is also used as a tool all 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.099
 These hares, however , have a separate year. 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:13.140
 history is best to take straight your 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.849
 lens but a few meanings 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.430
 aperture take off roughly the same 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.470
 plot and then at 100 percent 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.639
 increase see the pictures here then 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.949
 be clearly aware 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.880
 approximately what apertures will be the picture 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.789
 most dramatically 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.880
 then the seeds for you nakid diaphragms she 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.539
 we will begin for example one two times by this 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.770
 perplex 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:37.380
 well, you remember, respectively, the result 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.020
 such diaphragms adjust the amount 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.620
 light and manageable border sharply 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.620
 depicted space 

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:50.919
 matching you lens is strong 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:53.739
 Can the First shoot more in 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.919
 such difficult lighting conditions somehow 

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:57.729
 for example china in a dark room if 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.129
 where the light is very 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:07.269
 that you can open the diaphragm without 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:11.279
 outbreaks in focus 

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:11.279
 wallpaper them there already on the wall 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.630
 clamp aperture sensitivity 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.640
 raise the shutter speed increase now q 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.590
 talk further about you are all relative 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.320
 S THE same picture just 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:35.100
 relatively retire 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.100
 sign up don't always be a pastor . floor
