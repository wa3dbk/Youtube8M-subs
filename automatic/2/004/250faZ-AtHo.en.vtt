the mounting points for the five mounts

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.599 
the mounting points for the five mounts
aren't<00:01:03.960> exactly<00:01:04.469> the<00:01:04.619> same<00:01:04.859> as<00:01:05.039> on<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.189> 35

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:05.609 
aren't exactly the same as on the 35

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:07.669 
aren't exactly the same as on the 35
because<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.240> throttle<00:01:06.630> body<00:01:06.719> sits<00:01:07.079> straight

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
because the throttle body sits straight

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:13.099 
because the throttle body sits straight
as<00:01:07.889> opposed<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.249> angled<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:09.209> a<00:01:09.270> 45<00:01:10.459> so<00:01:12.109> this

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
as opposed to angled at a 45 so this

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.199 
as opposed to angled at a 45 so this
being<00:01:13.350> rigid<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.920> won't<00:01:14.069> have<00:01:14.219> to<00:01:14.429> do<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:15.209 
being rigid you won't have to do this

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.809 
being rigid you won't have to do this
one<00:01:15.450> which<00:01:15.569> attaches<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.109> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> firewall

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
one which attaches here to the firewall

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:22.819 
one which attaches here to the firewall
are<00:01:17.819> to<00:01:18.029> the<00:01:18.319> front<00:01:19.319> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.469> engine<00:01:20.159> bay<00:01:21.829> but

are to the front of the engine bay but

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.760 
are to the front of the engine bay but
the<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.159> over<00:01:23.279> here<00:01:23.749> fits<00:01:24.749> fine<00:01:25.109> gives<00:01:25.679> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the one over here fits fine gives it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.639 
the one over here fits fine gives it
about<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> inch<00:01:26.670> clearance<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.529> give<00:01:28.529> you

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
about a inch clearance and give you

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.929 
about a inch clearance and give you
space<00:01:28.950> between<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> belts<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:32.209> the<00:01:33.209> tubing

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
space between the belts and the tubing

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.749 
space between the belts and the tubing
you<00:01:35.939> also<00:01:36.419> have<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.779> do<00:01:36.929> on<00:01:37.169> the<00:01:37.859> 35<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:39.270> tube

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
you also have to do on the 35 this tube

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.889 
you also have to do on the 35 this tube
there's<00:01:41.759> about<00:01:42.029> a<00:01:42.090> six<00:01:42.989> inch<00:01:43.139> silicone<00:01:44.899> rubber

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
there's about a six inch silicone rubber

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.649 
there's about a six inch silicone rubber
tubing<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.279> supposed<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> connect<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
tubing that is supposed to connect to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.289 
tubing that is supposed to connect to
the<00:01:48.899> PCV<00:01:49.380> valve<00:01:49.849> since<00:01:50.849> you<00:01:50.939> already<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.209> it

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299

the PCV valve since you already have it
placed<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.869> within<00:01:52.139> the<00:01:52.409> elbow<00:01:53.219> itself<00:01:53.639> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
placed here within the elbow itself you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.469 
placed here within the elbow itself you
take<00:01:54.749> the<00:01:55.079> rubber<00:01:55.649> tubing<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.219> came<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.549> go

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
take the rubber tubing that came with go

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.999 
take the rubber tubing that came with go
to<00:01:57.539> like<00:01:57.779> an<00:01:57.989> advanced<00:01:58.380> autoparts<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.219> by

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
to like an advanced autoparts and by

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
to like an advanced autoparts and by
vacuum<00:02:02.009> line<00:02:02.189> caps<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.809> one's<00:02:03.959> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
vacuum line caps I think this one's a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.380 
vacuum line caps I think this one's a
3/4<00:02:05.149> insert<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.169> cut<00:02:07.859> it<00:02:07.979> about<00:02:08.610> two

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
3/4 insert it into and cut it about two

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.530 
3/4 insert it into and cut it about two
inches<00:02:09.829> that'll<00:02:10.829> stop<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.099> packing

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
inches that'll stop the packing

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.559 
inches that'll stop the packing
from<00:02:12.810> here<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:15.530> yeah<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:16.799> how<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> got<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
from here and yeah that's how I got the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.970 
from here and yeah that's how I got the
engine<00:02:18.569> intake<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.620> fit<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.459> my<00:02:21.230> 3.9<00:02:22.230> liter<00:02:22.349> v6

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
engine intake to fit on my 3.9 liter v6

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.000 
engine intake to fit on my 3.9 liter v6
I<00:02:23.250> hope<00:02:23.579> this<00:02:23.730> helped
