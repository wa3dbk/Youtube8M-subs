plant cilantro where the basil was in
the<00:00:24.510> garden<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.080> if<00:00:25.470> you've<00:00:25.619> ever<00:00:25.800> tried

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the garden and if you've ever tried

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.950 
the garden and if you've ever tried
cilantro<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> spring<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.660> it's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
cilantro in the spring you know it's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
cilantro in the spring you know it's
just<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.560> successful<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> goes<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.119> seed

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
just not successful it goes to seed

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.020 
just not successful it goes to seed
immediately<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:32.279> you're<00:00:32.430> looking<00:00:32.759> for

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
immediately so when you're looking for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.310 
immediately so when you're looking for
cilantro<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.930> 4-inch<00:00:34.440> pots<00:00:34.969> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.360> often<00:00:36.750> very

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
cilantro in 4-inch pots it is often very

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
cilantro in 4-inch pots it is often very
crowded<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> pots<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.940> you'll<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.360> at

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
crowded in the pots if you'll look at

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.709 
crowded in the pots if you'll look at
this<00:00:40.170> pot<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.250> there's<00:00:41.719> probably

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this pot you can see there's probably

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.410 
this pot you can see there's probably
eight<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:42.989> ten<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.950> cilantro<00:00:44.579> plants<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
eight or ten or more cilantro plants and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
eight or ten or more cilantro plants and
if<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.899> were<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.260> plant<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
if you were to plant that just like it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.750 
if you were to plant that just like it
is<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:49.680> okay<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.280> while<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is it's going to do okay for a while but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.100 
is it's going to do okay for a while but
then<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> plants<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> start<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
then the plants are going to start to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100 
then the plants are going to start to
struggle<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.070> probably<00:00:53.879> die<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.960> you've

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
struggle and probably die and if you've

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
struggle and probably die and if you've
had<00:00:55.289> trouble<00:00:55.469> growing<00:00:55.800> cilantro<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> past

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
had trouble growing cilantro in the past

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.770 
had trouble growing cilantro in the past
that<00:00:57.270> might<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.600> why<00:00:58.039> now<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.250> plant<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.850> kind

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that might be why now this plant is kind

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
that might be why now this plant is kind
of<00:01:00.899> small<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.129> rather<00:01:02.550> easy<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
of small so it would be rather easy to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.899 
of small so it would be rather easy to
take<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> apart<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.930> divide<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.909> separate

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
take it apart and divide it and separate

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.170 
take it apart and divide it and separate
it<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.869> plant<00:01:07.229> however<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.040> quite<00:01:08.549> crowded

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it this plant however is quite crowded

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270 
it this plant however is quite crowded
and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> plant<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.619> quite<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> bit

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and the and the plant is quite a bit

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.490 
and the and the plant is quite a bit
larger<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.510> looks<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
larger so it looks like it would be a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
larger so it looks like it would be a
better<00:01:13.770> buy<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
better buy but really it's going to be a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.390 
better buy but really it's going to be a
struggle<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.380> plant<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.979> survive<00:01:17.369> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
struggle for that plant to survive just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.120 
struggle for that plant to survive just
like<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.770> plant

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
like it is so what I would do is I plant

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.539 
like it is so what I would do is I plant
it<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.900> once<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.229> planted<00:01:22.530> let<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> grow<00:01:23.520> for

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it and once it's planted let it grow for

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.789 
it and once it's planted let it grow for
a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.090> bit<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.960> growing<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.590> would

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a little bit but as it's growing I would

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
a little bit but as it's growing I would
take<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:28.080> these<00:01:28.290> extra

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
take out one or two of these extra

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
take out one or two of these extra
plants<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> base<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
plants all the way down to the base you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.749 
plants all the way down to the base you
can<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> into<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> kitchen<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.700> cook

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
can take that into the kitchen and cook

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.480 
can take that into the kitchen and cook
with<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.049> way<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.710> plant<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> going

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
with it but that way this plant is going

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670 
with it but that way this plant is going
to<00:01:35.579> eventually<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.320> at

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
to eventually just have one or two at

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.490 
to eventually just have one or two at
one<00:01:38.490> place<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.420> will<00:01:39.570> survive<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.290> do

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one place and it will survive and do

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.810 
one place and it will survive and do
much<00:01:41.040> better<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.610> way

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
much better that way

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
much better that way
now<00:01:42.450> another<00:01:42.750> plant<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.649> fabulous<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
now another plant that is fabulous to

established<00:01:53.119> again<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.420> plant<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.110> multiple

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
established again this plant is multiple

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
established again this plant is multiple
plants<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.729> pot<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:57.420> many<00:01:57.689> many

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
plants in one pot there are many many

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.749 
plants in one pot there are many many
plants<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> little

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
plants in there and this one is a little

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.459 
plants in there and this one is a little
bit<00:02:00.000> further<00:02:00.240> along<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.020> roots<00:02:01.259> are

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
bit further along the roots are

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
bit further along the roots are
extending<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.159> from<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.180> pot<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> little

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
extending out from the the pot a little

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.230 
extending out from the the pot a little
bit<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.259> again<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> might<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> cut<00:02:05.820> some

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
bit so again I might go in and cut some

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880 
bit so again I might go in and cut some
of<00:02:06.299> those<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.079> down<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> base

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
of those all the way down to the base

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.119 
of those all the way down to the base
this<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:09.030> however<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.840> barely<00:02:10.379> crowded<00:02:10.950> but

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
this one however is barely crowded but

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.850 
this one however is barely crowded but
much<00:02:11.730> smaller<00:02:11.970> plants<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.140> not

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
much smaller plants it's not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
much smaller plants it's not
it<00:02:14.250> doesn't<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> root<00:02:15.120> system<00:02:15.360> that's

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it doesn't have a root system that's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.990 
it doesn't have a root system that's
winding<00:02:16.560> around<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.100> twisting<00:02:17.460> around<00:02:17.730> too

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
winding around and twisting around too

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.300 
winding around and twisting around too
much<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.140> teased<00:02:19.620> apart<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
much so that could be teased apart and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.090 
much so that could be teased apart and
separated<00:02:20.820> into<00:02:21.260> probably<00:02:22.260> eight<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.650> ten

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
separated into probably eight or ten

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.630 
separated into probably eight or ten
different<00:02:23.240> parsley<00:02:24.240> plants<00:02:25.130> same<00:02:26.130> thing<00:02:26.370> here

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
different parsley plants same thing here

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.420 
different parsley plants same thing here
with<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.970> fennel<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.430> really

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
with this fennel now this is really

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.830 
with this fennel now this is really
really<00:02:29.670> crowded<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.420> there's<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:30.810> least

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
really crowded I know there's at least

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.820 
really crowded I know there's at least
20<00:02:31.470> plants<00:02:31.740> there<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.530> divide<00:02:34.530> those

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
20 plants there and so to divide those

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.160 
20 plants there and so to divide those
just<00:02:35.160> gently<00:02:35.580> squeeze<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.030> pot<00:02:36.450> pull<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> out

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
just gently squeeze the pot pull it out

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.860 
just gently squeeze the pot pull it out
you<00:02:37.620> see<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.980> roots<00:02:38.250> are<00:02:38.490> kind<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.870> twisting

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you see the roots are kind of twisting

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.199 
you see the roots are kind of twisting
around<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.470> separate<00:02:41.250> those<00:02:41.459> out<00:02:41.640> sort<00:02:42.000> those

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
around so separate those out sort those

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.840 
around so separate those out sort those
out<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.630> you'll<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.410> gently<00:02:43.980> pull<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.670> apart

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
out and you'll just gently pull it apart

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
out and you'll just gently pull it apart
it's<00:02:45.510> best<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.380> when<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.770> soil

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it's best to do with this when the soil

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.710 
it's best to do with this when the soil
is<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.280> bit<00:02:47.670> damp<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:49.160> tear<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.250> apart<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:51.180> then

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
is a bit damp and tear it apart and then

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.410 
is a bit damp and tear it apart and then
you<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.170> take<00:02:52.470> these<00:02:52.800> little<00:02:53.160> divisions<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you can take these little divisions that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.150 
you can take these little divisions that
you've<00:02:54.690> got<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.260> might<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.890> two<00:02:56.130> or

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you've got and you might have two or

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.550 
you've got and you might have two or
three<00:02:56.340> plants<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.090> each<00:02:57.209> division<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.020> pop

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
three plants in each division and pop

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.610 
three plants in each division and pop
those<00:02:58.830> up<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.400> another<00:02:59.730> pot<00:03:00.000> let<00:03:00.360> them<00:03:00.540> sit<00:03:00.930> for

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
those up in another pot let them sit for

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.760 
those up in another pot let them sit for
a<00:03:01.650> week<00:03:02.070> or<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.880> roots<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.530> heal<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
a week or so for the roots to heal and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.750 
a week or so for the roots to heal and
repair<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:06.230> or<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.620> could<00:03:07.800> also<00:03:07.980> put<00:03:08.400> them<00:03:08.640> in

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760

them<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.360> fennel<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.440> fennel<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:32.430> be

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
them on the fennel so the fennel can be

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.789 
them on the fennel so the fennel can be
their<00:03:32.790> host<00:03:33.060> plant<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.110> dill<00:03:34.410> that's<00:03:34.709> a

little bit stretched a little bit long

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.140 
little bit stretched a little bit long
so<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> would<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.650> my<00:03:38.250> best<00:03:38.489> choice<00:03:38.850> I

for<00:03:44.190> roots<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:45.030> are<00:03:45.090> really<00:03:45.420> twisting<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
for roots that are really twisting and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
winding around like that make sure

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.190 
winding around like that make sure
you're<00:03:47.940> pulling<00:03:48.209> them<00:03:48.540> out<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.750> really

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
you're pulling them out and really

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.979 
you're pulling them out and really
separate<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:50.070> before<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.880> plant<00:03:51.150> them<00:03:51.390> now

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
separate them before you plant them now

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.750 
separate them before you plant them now
even<00:03:52.019> with<00:03:52.500> some<00:03:52.739> vegetables<00:03:53.400> you'll<00:03:53.580> get

plenty<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.080> regular<00:04:01.470> for<00:04:01.680> me<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.310> I'll

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
plenty of regular for me so I'll

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
separate them about twelve inches apart

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.880 
separate them about twelve inches apart
because<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.930> gets<00:04:07.290> big

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
because it gets big

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.430
