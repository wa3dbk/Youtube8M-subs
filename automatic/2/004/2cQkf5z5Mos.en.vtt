00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
other weirdest glitches again I started

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.290 
other weirdest glitches again I started
writing<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.440> very<00:02:03.860> reluctantly<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.849> still

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
writing that very reluctantly I still

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.300 
writing that very reluctantly I still
felt<00:02:05.539> overwhelmed<00:02:06.140> by<00:02:06.229> college<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.739> I<00:02:07.039> was

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
felt overwhelmed by college and I was

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.249 
felt overwhelmed by college and I was
feeling<00:02:07.520> tired<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.300> no<00:02:08.450> motivation<00:02:09.020> so

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
feeling tired and with no motivation so

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.530 
feeling tired and with no motivation so
I<00:02:09.530> started<00:02:10.160> writing<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:11.209> by<00:02:11.330> little

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
I started writing that little by little

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.690 
I started writing that little by little
after<00:02:12.110> every<00:02:12.650> small<00:02:12.890> writing<00:02:13.190> session<00:02:13.640> I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
after every small writing session I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.070 
after every small writing session I
would<00:02:13.760> look<00:02:14.000> back<00:02:14.209> at<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.540> realize<00:02:15.050> that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
would look back at it and realize that

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.679 
would look back at it and realize that
what<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.500> wrote<00:02:15.739> was<00:02:15.800> not<00:02:16.190> good<00:02:16.400> enough<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:17.330> felt

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
what I wrote was not good enough it felt

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.750 
what I wrote was not good enough it felt
rushed<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.439> bland<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:19.219> I<00:02:19.250> would<00:02:19.519> rewrite

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
rushed and bland so I would rewrite

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.980 
rushed and bland so I would rewrite
again<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.750> I

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
again and I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.830 
again and I
until<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.650> had<00:02:21.800> something<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.910> I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
until I had something that I like like I

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.020 
until I had something that I like like I
said<00:02:24.080> because<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.500> was<00:02:24.650> unmotivated<00:02:25.030> writing

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
said because I was unmotivated writing

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.850 
said because I was unmotivated writing
that<00:02:26.240> felt<00:02:26.570> less<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:26.990> hobby<00:02:27.260> less<00:02:27.680> like

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that felt less like a hobby less like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.500 
that felt less like a hobby less like
something<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.310> wanted<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.670> do<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.090> more<00:02:29.270> like<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
something I wanted to do and more like a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.800 
something I wanted to do and more like a
chore<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.370> left<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> while<00:02:32.300> until<00:02:32.330> I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
chore so I left it for a while until I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
chore so I left it for a while until I
was<00:02:32.990> feeling<00:02:33.290> motivated<00:02:33.770> again<00:02:33.860> eventually<00:02:34.700> I

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
was feeling motivated again eventually I

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.580 
was feeling motivated again eventually I
finished<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> most<00:02:35.690> difficult<00:02:36.170> session<00:02:36.500> in

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
finished the most difficult session in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.830 
finished the most difficult session in
college<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.070> entered<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.460> short<00:02:37.670> break<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.180> was

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
college and entered a short break I was

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.520 
college and entered a short break I was
feeling<00:02:39.140> good<00:02:39.230> again

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
feeling good again

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.010 
feeling good again
so<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.460> finished<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.850> script<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.330> was<00:02:41.390> happy<00:02:41.870> with

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
so I finished a script I was happy with

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.620 
so I finished a script I was happy with

on<00:02:44.660> two<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.200> early<00:02:45.440> segments<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.160> of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
on two of the early segments one of

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.000 
on two of the early segments one of
which<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.700> put<00:02:46.910> as<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> teaser<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.750> was<00:02:48.710> really

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
which I put as a teaser I was really

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.950 
which I put as a teaser I was really
feeling<00:02:49.220> it

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
feeling it

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.020 
feeling it
but<00:02:50.960> then<00:02:51.110> my<00:02:51.260> laptop<00:02:51.680> crashed<00:02:51.950> not<00:02:52.760> just

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
but then my laptop crashed not just

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.810 
but then my laptop crashed not just
crashed<00:02:53.300> broke<00:02:53.960> beyond<00:02:54.440> repair<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:55.100> took<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.730> to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
crashed broke beyond repair I took it to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.400 
crashed broke beyond repair I took it to
the<00:02:55.850> workshop<00:02:56.120> they<00:02:56.570> told<00:02:56.840> me<00:02:56.990> that<00:02:57.170> there<00:02:57.290> was

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the workshop they told me that there was

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.780 
the workshop they told me that there was
no<00:02:57.590> way<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.740> fix<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.310> would<00:02:58.430> have<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.640> buy<00:02:58.760> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
no way to fix it I would have to buy a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.720 
no way to fix it I would have to buy a
new<00:02:58.970> one<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.680> this<00:03:00.680> happened<00:03:01.190> just<00:03:01.280> as<00:03:01.610> I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
new one and this happened just as I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.090 
new one and this happened just as I
thought<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.180> backing<00:03:02.600> up<00:03:02.720> my<00:03:02.870> files<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:04.070> I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
thought of backing up my files but I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.010 
thought of backing up my files but I
thought<00:03:04.400> about<00:03:04.550> doing<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:05.120> just<00:03:05.420> far<00:03:05.720> too

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
thought about doing that just far too

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.210 
thought about doing that just far too
late<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:08.000> lost<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.660> script<00:03:08.960> I<00:03:09.080> wrote<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.620> lost

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
late so I lost the script I wrote I lost

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.070 
late so I lost the script I wrote I lost
several<00:03:10.520> other<00:03:10.790> documents<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.480> spent<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.900> lot<00:03:12.020> of

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
as you can imagine I didn't take that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.290 
as you can imagine I didn't take that
too<00:03:17.600> good<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.050> actually<00:03:18.920> got<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.460> crest<00:03:19.790> and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
all of a sudden the motivation I had

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.580 
all of a sudden the motivation I had
must<00:03:22.760> have<00:03:22.880> dropped<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.270> like<00:03:23.450> negative<00:03:23.960> one<00:03:24.260> I

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
must have dropped to like negative one I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.400 
must have dropped to like negative one I
was<00:03:25.250> beyond<00:03:25.910> unmotivated<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.900> extremely

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
was beyond unmotivated and extremely
