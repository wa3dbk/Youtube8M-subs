00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.740
 Hello everyone, I am Mark Brown. 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.380
 Here is the Game Production Toolbox. 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.340
 A series about game design 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.960
 Now showing the iPhone game "Random Hero" 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.780
 It is a mobile shooting platform game and a real game. 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.180
 But it feels bad and has no fun like playing cabbage. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.360
 It doesn't seem to mean anything, right? 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.960
 "Super Time Force" is a completely different experience. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.380
 It's energetic, full of feedback bursts of bursts like currents oscillating back and forth in your Xbox 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.020
 It is more fun 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.000
 I think this is a show of personal developers - here is Capy - 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 How do you remember the game? 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 That is: 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.900
 "gaming" 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.660
 This is an abstract concept 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.500
 In general, an invisible art 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.380
 But it is crucial for making action games or platform games. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.900
 Once the player starts using the handle, they can feel whether you are doing good or bad. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.140
 It mostly exists in the basic operation of the game. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 Control the moments in the game 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.780
 Hidden under the surface of the game 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 A good way to test gameplay is to strip all the decorations. 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.880
 Look at the game if there are no scores, stories, pictures, music, and clever level design 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 Isn't there even a trap that your game is still very fun? 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.760
 Super Mario Game will still be fun 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.120
 In Mario 64, Mario’s character is very interesting to control. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.940
 He has bouncing, stepping on the wall, jumping high, jumping, and fleas. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.160
 You may spend a few hours in the empty house. 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 It is said that in the early months of game development 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.140
 "Mario 64" has always been like this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.140
 Miyamoto has been adjusting Mario’s movement before doing anything else. 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.460
 The "gameplay" here is related to friction, momentum and the weight of Mario. This is the most important. 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.980
 In fact, the level design and enemies in Mario 64 are made for Mario's show. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.280
 The level allows players to feel the movement of Mario 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.160
 And test if the player has mastered Mario’s athletic ability. 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.280
 Other developers have already done this as an example. The original level of Super Meat Boy is also very fun. 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.360
 But rough controls and boring moves are still abound in platform games. 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.520
 The same best action game is just fun when the enemy is constantly appearing. 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.600
 But many action games lack such ability. 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.660
 I can't help much when it comes to the basic mechanism. 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.360
 Gameplay is completely different in every type of game. 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.180
 And "learning from Miyamoto" is not a useful suggestion. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.760
 But there are a lot of tricks in the polishing stage. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.420
 You can learn these skills from good games and make your game a lot better. 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.160
 I will plagiarize a lot of ideas here. They come from Vlambeer, Cactus, Grapefrukt. 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.460
 If you want to learn more, take a look at the introduction below. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.860
 The first thing that comes out is the screen jitter. Vlambeer can be said to be the king of this gadget. 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.620
 The screen sways uncontrollably as you shoot, hit the enemy, and smash the big fish 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.400
 This provides instant feedback that makes the player feel that he is communicating with the game world. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.380
 Vlambeer also likes to pause a few frames when you hit or kill an enemy. 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.140
 This makes the game more impactful 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 You can see this in fighting games too. 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.740
 Look at the action in "Street Fighter". This is more like sending an enemy back to his hometown. 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.500
 "God of War" did the same 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.280
 Most of Zelda did the same. 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.920
 To be honest, any means of showing that you hit the enemy is valuable. 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.360
 Let them flash, repel, bleed, change animations, or play sounds. 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.840
 It effectively provides feedback to enhance gameplay 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500
 There are other similar effects that can make players really feel like they are part of the world. 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.180
 For example, the recoil of a tiny dust when it hits the ground. 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.120
 The sound effect is very key, the sound effect is low and loud. 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.120
 The gunshot sounds like it shouldn't be like this... 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.080
 It sounds like this... 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.000
 You can add randomness to the sound to avoid duplication. 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.540
 Or use the ideas in Mario and Peggle to play different sounds in a combo to enhance fun. 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.320
 Next, use the field of view more creatively. 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.720
 In the "Luftrausers" vision will not follow your aircraft movement 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.460
 It moves intelligently to show your movements and the dangers around you 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.420
 In the Miami Hotline, more will show the direction of the character. 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.220
 This allows the player to understand the orientation of the character. 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.720
 Make things big and big 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.480
 The bullet is made as big as the character's face like in the Nuclear Throne. 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.480
 Like the "Super Time Force", the explosion is done like a small atomic bomb. 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.500
 Like the "Hotline Miami", the blood is made like a red fountain. 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.820
 The Miami Hotline has a mechanism that no other game has. 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.880
 The body and plasma will stay on the floor 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.380
 Give you some time to recall the mess you created when you enter the car. 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 And let you think that the previous battle is really not easy 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.500
 Finally we got 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.320
 "sugar" (Juice) 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.780
 It refers to everything that can enhance your content on the game. 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.240
 If it is a shooting game, then let the gun have a recoil speed to speed up the fire, shake the camera every time you shoot it. 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.200
 If it's a jump game, then give your character a friction camera to stay still to help the player complete each jump 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.740
 Gameplay requires developers to spend months, even years, polishing 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.800
 So in this five-minute video you probably can't find the secret to making gameplay. 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.660
 But I hope that you can learn some basic motion optimization methods. 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.040
 Let every play really enjoy the game content 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.640
 If you can follow this advice then maybe, probably, maybe 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.240
 I don't have to play so many lifeless iOS games in my future work.
