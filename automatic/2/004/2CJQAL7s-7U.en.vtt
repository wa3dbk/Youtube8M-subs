decision in a minute if we have a quick
glance<00:00:48.949> of<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.280> traits<00:00:49.550> there<00:00:49.820> will<00:00:49.910> be<00:00:50.030> a

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
glance of the traits there will be a

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.670 
glance of the traits there will be a
link<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.660> description<00:00:51.230> below<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:51.500> that

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
link in the description below so that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.069 
link in the description below so that
you<00:00:51.859> can<00:00:52.010> see<00:00:52.219> in<00:00:52.340> more<00:00:52.519> detail<00:00:53.059> but<00:00:53.809> I've<00:00:53.930> gone

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
you can see in more detail but I've gone

30<00:00:54.379> points<00:00:54.769> into<00:00:55.010> explosives<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.969> that's<00:00:56.359> the

30 points into explosives and that's the

30 points into explosives and that's the

dominant line of traits and that gives

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.270 
dominant line of traits and that gives

be<00:03:04.340> incredibly<00:03:04.790> useful<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:06.489> decided<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.700> get

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
be incredibly useful I decided to get

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.460 
be incredibly useful I decided to get
the<00:03:07.910> nightmare<00:03:08.630> runes<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.230> particular

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
the nightmare runes for this particular

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.160 
the nightmare runes for this particular
build<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.880> nightmare<00:03:11.270> runes<00:03:11.570> basically

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
build and the nightmare runes basically

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.260 
build and the nightmare runes basically
increase<00:03:12.500> our<00:03:12.680> conditions<00:03:13.190> in<00:03:13.370> every<00:03:13.640> way<00:03:13.850> now

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
increase our conditions in every way now

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.900 
increase our conditions in every way now
the<00:03:14.750> night<00:03:15.140> marion's<00:03:15.560> give<00:03:15.980> us<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.310> big<00:03:16.670> boost

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
the night marion's give us a big boost

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.789 
the night marion's give us a big boost
in<00:03:17.150> conditional<00:03:17.660> damage<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.200> conditional

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
in conditional damage and conditional

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.949 
in conditional damage and conditional
duration<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.580> that's<00:03:20.209> why<00:03:20.390> they<00:03:20.540> caught<00:03:20.780> my

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
duration and that's why they caught my

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.100 
duration and that's why they caught my
eye<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:22.190> got<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.610> pvp<00:03:23.330> Knights<00:03:23.600> amulet

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
eye I then got the pvp Knights amulet

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.009 
eye I then got the pvp Knights amulet
and<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:25.040> Knights<00:03:25.280> amulet<00:03:25.730> gives<00:03:25.940> us<00:03:26.209> actually

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
and the Knights amulet gives us actually

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.470 
and the Knights amulet gives us actually
quite<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> decent<00:03:27.950> crit<00:03:28.459> chance<00:03:28.489> as<00:03:28.970> well<00:03:29.299> as<00:03:29.450> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
quite a decent crit chance as well as a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.780 
quite a decent crit chance as well as a
big<00:03:29.720> increase<00:03:30.019> in<00:03:30.140> our<00:03:30.440> power<00:03:30.709> now<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.250> power

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
big increase in our power now the power

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.160 
big increase in our power now the power
as<00:03:31.970> I've<00:03:32.150> probably<00:03:32.630> explained<00:03:33.019> before

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
as I've probably explained before

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.289 
as I've probably explained before
increases<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.130> damage<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.549> everything<00:03:35.090> and

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
increases the damage of everything and

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.240 
increases the damage of everything and
then<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:36.019> precision<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:36.769> get<00:03:36.920> from<00:03:36.950> this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
then the precision that we get from this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.670 
then the precision that we get from this
is<00:03:37.459> increasing<00:03:37.970> got<00:03:38.150> crit<00:03:38.450> chance<00:03:38.480> as<00:03:38.930> well<00:03:39.560> as

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
is increasing got crit chance as well as

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.440 
is increasing got crit chance as well as
the<00:03:39.830> increased<00:03:40.190> vitality<00:03:40.519> which<00:03:41.209> actually

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
the increased vitality which actually

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.420 
the increased vitality which actually
gives<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:42.019> build<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.440> massive<00:03:42.709> health<00:03:43.160> pool

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
gives this build a massive health pool

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.160 
gives this build a massive health pool
one<00:03:44.209> thing<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.510> might<00:03:44.870> be<00:03:45.019> worth

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
one thing that might be worth

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.350 
one thing that might be worth
considering<00:03:45.709> is<00:03:46.100> if<00:03:46.370> your<00:03:46.579> team<00:03:46.850> wants<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.209> to

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
considering is if your team wants you to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.150 
considering is if your team wants you to
go<00:03:47.570> full<00:03:47.840> support<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.590> tournament<00:03:49.010> match

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
go full support in the tournament match

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.340 
go full support in the tournament match
then<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.239> always<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.900> option<00:03:50.930> of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
then you do always have the option of

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.069 
then you do always have the option of
changing<00:03:51.620> one<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.130> your<00:03:52.310> utility<00:03:52.940> skills<00:03:53.239> for

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
changing one of your utility skills for

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.840 
changing one of your utility skills for
example<00:03:54.500> if<00:03:54.650> your<00:03:54.860> team<00:03:55.100> wanted<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.670> go

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
example if your team wanted you to go

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.210 
example if your team wanted you to go
full<00:03:56.090> support<00:03:56.540> are<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.350> probably<00:03:57.860> end<00:03:58.100> up

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
full support are you probably end up

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.009 
full support are you probably end up
changing<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.670> bomb<00:03:58.940> kit<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.360> something<00:03:59.780> like

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019
