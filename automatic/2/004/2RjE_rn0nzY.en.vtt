to<00:00:24.550> be<00:00:24.640> well<00:00:24.759> rested<00:00:25.169> but<00:00:26.169> I<00:00:26.230> just<00:00:26.410> finished

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
to be well rested but I just finished

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
running an 8k eight actually point 17 i

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.760 
running an 8k eight actually point 17 i
think<00:00:30.220> in<00:00:30.749> 34<00:00:31.749> minutes<00:00:31.900> which<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.410> fastest

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
think in 34 minutes which is the fastest

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.910 
think in 34 minutes which is the fastest
I<00:00:32.860> think<00:00:33.129> I've<00:00:33.219> actually<00:00:33.460> ever<00:00:33.820> run<00:00:34.180> period

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I think I've actually ever run period

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.939 
I think I've actually ever run period
that<00:00:35.920> distance<00:00:37.289> which<00:00:38.289> has<00:00:38.440> been<00:00:38.739> really

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
that distance which has been really

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.790 
that distance which has been really
awesome<00:00:39.039> my<00:00:39.879> last<00:00:40.059> few<00:00:40.359> runs<00:00:40.559> had<00:00:41.559> a<00:00:41.590> lot<00:00:41.770> of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
awesome my last few runs had a lot of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.920 
awesome my last few runs had a lot of
speed<00:00:42.190> just<00:00:43.149> something<00:00:43.359> I'm<00:00:43.420> not<00:00:43.539> a<00:00:43.570> stabbing

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
speed just something I'm not a stabbing

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.229 
speed just something I'm not a stabbing
I'm<00:00:44.920> normally<00:00:45.309> very<00:00:45.899> slow<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.980> for<00:00:48.399> me<00:00:48.550> speed

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
I'm normally very slow but for me speed

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.340 
I'm normally very slow but for me speed
so<00:00:50.019> I<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:51.489> been<00:00:51.640> thinking<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.149> I'm<00:00:52.350> I've

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
so I was been thinking that I'm I've

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.349 
so I was been thinking that I'm I've
been<00:00:53.500> very<00:00:53.620> undertrained<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.940> marathon

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
been very undertrained the marathon

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.700 
been very undertrained the marathon
because<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:55.750> didn't<00:00:55.929> really<00:00:56.079> get<00:00:56.170> very<00:00:56.559> many

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
because I didn't really get very many

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.979 
because I didn't really get very many
quality<00:00:56.800> long<00:00:57.340> runs<00:00:57.550> in<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:58.660> be<00:00:58.750> honest<00:00:58.929> I

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
quality long runs in to be honest I

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.709 
quality long runs in to be honest I
think<00:00:59.140> my<00:00:59.230> longest<00:00:59.800> long<00:01:00.010> run<00:01:00.190> was<00:01:00.359> only<00:01:01.359> 25

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719
