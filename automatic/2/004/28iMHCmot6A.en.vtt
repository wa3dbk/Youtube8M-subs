that link that down below and then I'll

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.020 
that link that down below and then I'll
go<00:00:39.750> something<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.469> screens<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.040> mercy

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.750 

a<00:00:46.090> lot<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:46.989> work<00:00:47.350> into<00:00:47.530> this

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.880 

the<00:00:53.420> first<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.780> can<00:00:53.840> be<00:00:54.050> anything<00:00:54.260> as<00:00:54.560> some

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
the first you can be anything as some

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.890 
the first you can be anything as some
glycerin<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.120> skin<00:00:56.360> protective

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
glycerin and it is the skin protective

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.300 
glycerin and it is the skin protective
so<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.410> won't<00:00:57.650> harm<00:00:57.830> your<00:00:58.070> skin<00:01:00.130> next<00:01:01.130> you'll

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
so it won't harm your skin next you'll

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.890 
so it won't harm your skin next you'll
be<00:01:01.340> naming<00:01:01.640> some<00:01:02.000> food<00:01:02.240> coloring<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.840> the

be naming some food coloring and the
colors<00:01:03.260> that<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.470> picked<00:01:03.770> out<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.250> brands

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
colors that I picked out in the brands

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.910 
colors that I picked out in the brands
are<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.940> closest<00:01:05.449> colors<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.140> products

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
are the closest colors to the products

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.100 
are the closest colors to the products
that<00:01:07.010> I<00:01:07.070> was<00:01:07.310> trying<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.880> do<00:01:08.300> so<00:01:08.690> if<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.930> use

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
that I was trying to do so if you use

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.360 
that I was trying to do so if you use
achill<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> use<00:01:09.980> you're<00:01:10.130> probably

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
achill is that I use you're probably

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.040 
achill is that I use you're probably
gonna<00:01:10.580> get<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.940> closest<00:01:11.480> color<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.930> the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
gonna get the closest color to the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.750 
gonna get the closest color to the
actual<00:01:12.350> product<00:01:14.890> next<00:01:15.890> we'll<00:01:16.100> be<00:01:16.190> dating<00:01:16.520> some

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
actual product next we'll be dating some

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.190 
actual product next we'll be dating some
nail<00:01:16.910> polish<00:01:17.180> drawers<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.660> can<00:01:17.780> just<00:01:17.990> use

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
nail polish drawers so you can just use

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.870 
nail polish drawers so you can just use
like<00:01:18.350> really<00:01:18.680> any<00:01:18.950> container<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:19.730> think

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
like really any container I just think

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.340 
like really any container I just think
that<00:01:19.970> nail<00:01:20.180> plus<00:01:20.390> jars<00:01:20.630> make<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.990> look<00:01:21.140> even

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
that nail plus jars make it look even

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.050 
that nail plus jars make it look even
more<00:01:21.620> similar<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:22.490> here's<00:01:22.730> just<00:01:22.790> an

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
more similar and then here's just an

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.690 
more similar and then here's just an
example<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.570> what<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.870> looks<00:01:23.900> like<00:01:24.550> make<00:01:25.550> sure

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
example of what it looks like make sure

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.640 
example of what it looks like make sure
we'll<00:01:25.790> need<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.940> metal<00:01:26.210> bowl<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.320> metal

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
we'll need a metal bowl and then a metal

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.830 
we'll need a metal bowl and then a metal
pot<00:01:30.520> starting<00:01:31.520> by<00:01:31.670> filling<00:01:32.030> up<00:01:32.150> at<00:01:32.300> your<00:01:32.510> pot

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
pot starting by filling up at your pot

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.320 
pot starting by filling up at your pot
probably<00:01:33.290> halfway<00:01:33.530> are<00:01:34.010> 3/4<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.880> way<00:01:35.000> fold

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
probably halfway are 3/4 of the way fold

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.730 
probably halfway are 3/4 of the way fold
this<00:01:35.660> part<00:01:35.840> doesn't<00:01:36.170> really<00:01:36.320> matter<00:01:36.560> it

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
this part doesn't really matter it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.999 
this part doesn't really matter it
doesn't<00:01:36.890> need<00:01:37.160> an<00:01:37.400> exact<00:01:37.850> measurement<00:01:38.509> and

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
doesn't need an exact measurement and

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.250 
doesn't need an exact measurement and
then<00:01:40.009> just<00:01:40.220> pop<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.400> onto<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.000> stove

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.930 

taking<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.410> glycerin<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.340> then<00:01:45.580> I'm<00:01:45.700> just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
taking the glycerin and then I'm just

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.640 
taking the glycerin and then I'm just
filling<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.360> up<00:01:46.450> probably<00:01:46.690> like<00:01:46.930> three<00:01:47.380> four

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
filling it up probably like three four

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.610 
filling it up probably like three four
set<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:48.220> tablespoon<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.170> filled<00:01:50.470> up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
set of a tablespoon and that filled up

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.430 
set of a tablespoon and that filled up
my<00:01:50.650> jar<00:01:51.130> halfway<00:01:51.940> about<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:53.020> uses<00:01:53.380> as

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
my jar halfway about so it just uses as

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.500 
my jar halfway about so it just uses as
much<00:01:53.470> as<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.890> think<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.280> then<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.910> use<00:01:55.180> the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
much as you think and then I use the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.760 
much as you think and then I use the
food<00:01:55.780> coloring<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.260> I'm<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.560> kind<00:01:56.710> of

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
food coloring and I'm just kind of

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.990 
food coloring and I'm just kind of
showing<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.070> what<00:01:57.160> it<00:01:57.370> looks<00:01:57.490> like<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.850> will

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
showing you what it looks like it will

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.630 
showing you what it looks like it will
be<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.150> lot<00:01:58.540> like<00:01:58.840> thinner<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.530> less<00:01:59.860> pigmented

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
be a lot like thinner and less pigmented

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.080 
be a lot like thinner and less pigmented
um<00:02:00.940> with<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.080> glycerin<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.670> might

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
um with the glycerin in it so you might

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.660 
um with the glycerin in it so you might
want<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.479> add<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.229> lot<00:02:05.470> more<00:02:05.530> than<00:02:05.890> what<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.220> added

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
want to add a lot more than what I added

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.260 
want to add a lot more than what I added
in<00:02:06.820> there

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
in there

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.570 
in there
um<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.930> ended<00:02:08.229> up<00:02:08.320> going<00:02:08.619> back<00:02:08.740> into<00:02:09.160> adding<00:02:09.490> a

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
um I ended up going back into adding a

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.889 
um I ended up going back into adding a
lot<00:02:09.700> more<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.149> because<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.690> wouldn't

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
lot more just because I wouldn't

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.300 
lot more just because I wouldn't
necessarily<00:02:11.170> show<00:02:11.740> up<00:02:11.800> on<00:02:11.920> my<00:02:12.010> skin<00:02:12.250> because

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
necessarily show up on my skin because

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.430 
necessarily show up on my skin because
the<00:02:12.550> glycerin<00:02:13.060> thinned<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.780> out<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.990> little<00:02:14.200> bit

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the glycerin thinned it out a little bit

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.470 
the glycerin thinned it out a little bit
too<00:02:14.620> much<00:02:17.790> after<00:02:18.790> you're<00:02:18.910> done<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.330> you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
too much after you're done with that you

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.020 
too much after you're done with that you
can<00:02:19.540> take<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.140> off<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.530> these<00:02:20.650> stew<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.370> then

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
can take it off of these stew and then

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.060 
can take it off of these stew and then
you<00:02:22.209> just<00:02:22.420> want<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> take<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.350> bottle<00:02:23.770> and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
you just want to take the bottle and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.680 
you just want to take the bottle and
you're<00:02:24.250> going<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.550> want<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.850> slowly<00:02:25.239> dip<00:02:25.570> it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
you're going to want to slowly dip it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.390 
you're going to want to slowly dip it
into<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.080> hot<00:02:26.290> water<00:02:26.320> there<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.130> all<00:02:27.280> you're

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
into the hot water there is all you're

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.250 
into the hot water there is all you're
doing<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.910> because<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.480> take<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
doing this is because if you take the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.650 
doing this is because if you take the
hot<00:02:29.470> glycerin<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.280> pour<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:30.970> into<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.360> bottle

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
hot glycerin and pour it into the bottle

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.170 
hot glycerin and pour it into the bottle
then<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.989> bottle<00:02:32.440> will<00:02:32.590> crack<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.760> it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
then the bottle will crack and so it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.350 
then the bottle will crack and so it's
just<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.450> lot<00:02:34.630> easier<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.290> do<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.440> this

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.150 

next<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.480> pour<00:02:39.750> your<00:02:39.780> product<00:02:40.230> into<00:02:40.470> your
