second<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.800> fp7<00:00:29.130> would<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> laser<00:00:30.029> sight

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
second is the fp7 would be a laser sight

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.560 
second is the fp7 would be a laser sight
and<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.120> why<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.149> he<00:00:33.329> supposed

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
class we're learning with hands clasp

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.350 
class we're learning with hands clasp
hands<00:00:38.370> engineer<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.600> highways<00:00:40.230> see<00:00:40.620> them

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
hands engineer and highways see them

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.160 
hands engineer and highways see them
hardline<00:00:42.360> does<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:42.930> matter<00:00:43.050> about

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
hardline does it really matter about

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.920 
hardline does it really matter about
your<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.590> bag<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.920> try<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.399> lightly

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
your first bag I try to go lightly

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.190 
your first bag I try to go lightly
actually<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> best<00:00:48.989> class

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
actually so this is the best class

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.810 
actually so this is the best class
because<00:00:50.270> fire<00:00:51.270> rate<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> swapping<00:00:52.079> is

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
because fire rate and swapping is

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.319 
because fire rate and swapping is
extremely<00:00:53.820> quick<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.350> sure

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
extremely quick and I'm really sure

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
extremely quick and I'm really sure
after<00:00:57.329> patch<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:58.129> before<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.340> patch

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
after patch but I know before the patch

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
after patch but I know before the patch
if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.449> aim<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.840> side<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.320> laser

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
if you aim down the side with laser

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.640 
if you aim down the side with laser
sight<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:03.000> pretty<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.570> couldn't<00:01:04.379> miss

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
sight on you pretty much couldn't miss

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.789 
sight on you pretty much couldn't miss
if<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.519> were<00:01:05.640> aiming<00:01:05.790> anywhere<00:01:06.479> around<00:01:06.799> their

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
if you were aiming anywhere around their

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.730 
if you were aiming anywhere around their
body<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.260> example<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.619> how

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
body so just as an example of how

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
body so just as an example of how
quickly<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.130> swap<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> our<00:01:12.060> quick<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> fire

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
quickly I can swap and our quick to fire

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
quickly I can swap and our quick to fire
rate<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> sugar<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.280> their

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
rate is because of sugar that's their

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.679 
rate is because of sugar that's their
extremely<00:01:15.360> good<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.990> black<00:01:16.170> ops<00:01:16.380> 2<00:01:17.570> if<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
extremely good in black ops 2 if you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.850 
extremely good in black ops 2 if you
have<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.970> twice<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.000> good

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
have two of them on it's twice as good

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.330 
have two of them on it's twice as good
because<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.400> times<00:01:23.729> two<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.299> two<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
because one times two is two so it's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.080 
because one times two is two so it's
twice<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:27.979> do<00:01:28.979> shrieks<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.700> score

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
twice as good do shrieks will score

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
twice as good do shrieks will score
streaks<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> something<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
streaks actually which is something that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
streaks actually which is something that
i<00:01:31.770> liked<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> they've<00:01:32.220> done<00:01:32.400> doesn't<00:01:33.329> matter

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
i liked it they've done doesn't matter

is going to help especially in a fairly

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.850 
is going to help especially in a fairly
close<00:03:00.120> quarters<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.570> because<00:03:01.170> knifing

close quarters like that because knifing

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.660 
close quarters like that because knifing
has<00:03:02.820> been<00:03:03.209> downgraded<00:03:03.690> bit<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.890> you're<00:03:05.520> just

a decision I believe all this if I made
a<00:04:00.750> few<00:04:00.989> decisions<00:04:01.860> but<00:04:02.190> there's<00:04:02.370> no<00:04:02.459> point

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
a few decisions but there's no point

for<00:04:30.270> me<00:04:30.360> in<00:04:30.479> black<00:04:30.630> ops<00:04:30.810> OOP<00:04:31.050> aiming<00:04:31.770> i<00:04:31.949> think

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
for me in black ops OOP aiming i think

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.909 
for me in black ops OOP aiming i think
is<00:04:32.669> better<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.510> game<00:04:33.780> on<00:04:33.960> standby<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.650> i

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
is better on this game on standby and i

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.710 
is better on this game on standby and i
think<00:04:35.130> it's<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> lot<00:04:35.400> quicker<00:04:35.610> with<00:04:36.300> we<00:04:36.570> aim

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
think it's a lot quicker with we aim

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.310 
think it's a lot quicker with we aim
