00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:10.910
 we are here at the smau a bari after the 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.509
 non smau presentation of this Milan 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.850
 time with all the products at the venue 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.740
 complete in particular we have the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.270
 core version unlike the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.890
 previous time in which we present the 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.940
 ato version and with 5 8 gb of ram and 256 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.700
 the solid state disk 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.329
 the thickness is very similar to the version 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.520
 atom that we had shown remains a while 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.680
 heavier we talk about about one 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.350
 hundred grams more though the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.780
 concept of the services ability remains 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.090
 however the same then the possibility 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.090
 to access the battery for 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.280
 replace it to the hard disk at 3g 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.250
 integrated and wireless product 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.399
 very devoted to the business field the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.970
 venue 11 today we present it with one 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.820
 series of kits that make it a product 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.770
 compact that becomes both a desktop like 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.470
 for example with the docking station of 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.549
 connectable lucky station productivity 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.369
 even to two monitors at the same time 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.969
 then it manages the dual display at 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.920
 read 45 recharges the tablet e 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.679
 that we turn into a solution 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.780
 desktop to all effects 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:24.109
 doors on board 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.609
 we have three usb 3.0 two in one part 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:31.249
 back is one in the front to manage 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.369
 any peripherals on the fly then 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:36.380
 we have a rj45 port for the la network 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.109
 corporate network but above all we have 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.259
 two video outputs one displayport and one 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.270
 hdmi useful to manage the dual disp the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.979
 dual monitor so especially given the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.460
 tablet performance even for those 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.220
 that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.409
 we use the double monitor we have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 also obviously being two who 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.729
 station in a port replicator 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.979
 the input for the power supply that goes to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.800
 charge the tablet then on 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.790
 front part in addition to having the led of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.210
 recharge 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.850
 we also have a headphone jack 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.330
 microphone and a combo a solution 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.459
 so very very complete with spies 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.730
 second accessory I want to present 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.060
 and the mobile keyboard 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.550
 the very sturdy metal keyboard for 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.220
 those users who need one 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.150
 of an experience very similar to that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.410
 of an ultrabook this keyboard has one 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.390
 really nice feature that 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.640
 that of materials of a certain of a 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.590
 certain type but above all the possibility 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.019
 also to increase productivity 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.930
 because it goes to integrate a battery 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.390
 additional which adds about 50 per 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.760
 percent of the performance of the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.799
 battery already integrated in the tablet 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.980
 Another element of this kit always 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.930
 very interesting I'll show you it is 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.489
 the fact that it can be anyway 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.150
 recharged also separately from the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.890
 tablet for which we say it can be 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.180
 managed a recharge even longer 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.220
 term 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.780
 as you can see from the connectors it comes to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.190
 a proprietary solution is not one 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.750
 third part is specially designed 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.810
 for dell 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.060
 we always have a third solution 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.670
 traditional input mode for 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.140
 those users who do not want to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.690
 make the tablet heavier 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.780
 in fact a very limited weight that the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.600
 there are keyboard we call light 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.750
 of the magnetic connectors that allow 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.170
 to connect the tablet very easily 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.880
 to the keyboard there is always the mode of 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.100
 traditional physical input with the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.770
 touchpad in the back 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.420
 we also have a magnetic stand that 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.020
 can therefore adjust and the inclination of the 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.660
 Tablet 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.110
 the complete solution also becomes one 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.870
 cover for tablet as in this case 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.780
 very elegant and above all it also goes to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.750
 add the appropriate hook for the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.980
 digital stylus pen among other things now 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.860
 certified for graphometric vi 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.110
 I invite you to see our products on 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.090
 site dell especially to linger on 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.519
 these solutions on these kits that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.640
 make the tablet or a solution all in 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.640
 one
