start off by making these two little

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.850 
start off by making these two little
funnel<00:02:00.210> pieces<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.929> go<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.380> top<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> the

Train to do this take our large

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.359 
Train to do this take our large
rectangle<00:02:06.030> piece<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.229> place<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> two<00:02:07.920> ends

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
rectangle piece and place the two ends

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.070 
rectangle piece and place the two ends
together<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> form<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.780> cylinder

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
together so that you form a cylinder

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.949 
together so that you form a cylinder
just<00:02:10.769> like<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:12.450> I'm<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:12.810> going

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.670 
stitch here is what that looks like and
now<00:03:45.000> taking<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.660> piece<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.200> cut<00:03:46.350> out

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
now taking this piece that we cut out

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.130 
now taking this piece that we cut out
earlier<00:03:47.130> I'm<00:03:47.790> going<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.150> place<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.690> on<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
earlier I'm going to place that on the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.800 
earlier I'm going to place that on the
back<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.950> piece<00:03:50.130> we<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.520> made<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.150> again

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
back of the piece we just made and again

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.600 
back of the piece we just made and again
using<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.440> blanket<00:03:52.800> stitch<00:03:52.920> I'm<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.550> to

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
using the blanket stitch I'm going to

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.670 
using the blanket stitch I'm going to
sew<00:03:53.820> along<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.240> edge<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.930> secure<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.530> in

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
sew along this edge to secure that in

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.640 
sew along this edge to secure that in
place<00:03:55.710> just<00:03:57.050> like<00:03:58.050> that

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
place just like that

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.210 
place just like that
and<00:03:59.330> now<00:04:00.330> taking<00:04:00.630> your<00:04:01.290> other<00:04:01.680> pieces<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and now taking your other pieces the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.820 
and now taking your other pieces the
larger<00:04:02.730> pieces<00:04:02.990> we're<00:04:03.990> basically<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:04.530> going

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
larger pieces we're basically just going

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.160 
larger pieces we're basically just going
to<00:04:04.920> do<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> exact<00:04:05.490> same<00:04:05.580> thing<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.420> form<00:04:06.930> this

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
to do the exact same thing so form this

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.470 
to do the exact same thing so form this
rectangular<00:04:07.920> piece<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.060> goes<00:04:09.210> around

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
rectangular piece so that it goes around

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.890 
rectangular piece so that it goes around
the<00:04:09.660> Arctic<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> blanket<00:04:12.300> stitch<00:04:12.510> to

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the Arctic and so a blanket stitch to

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.160 
the Arctic and so a blanket stitch to
attach<00:04:13.200> those<00:04:13.890> two<00:04:14.070> pieces<00:04:14.280> together<00:04:15.170> like

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
attach those two pieces together like

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.160 
attach those two pieces together like
that<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:17.299> then<00:04:18.299> use<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> blanket<00:04:19.020> stitch

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
that and then use the blanket stitch

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.830 
that and then use the blanket stitch
again<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:20.010> attach<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.670> piece<00:04:20.940> onto<00:04:21.690> this

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
again to attach this piece onto this

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.490 
again to attach this piece onto this
piece<00:04:23.000> okay<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.060> once<00:04:24.540> you've<00:04:24.810> done<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:24.990> it

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
piece okay so once you've done that it

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.350 
piece okay so once you've done that it
should<00:04:25.770> look<00:04:25.920> something<00:04:25.980> like<00:04:26.430> this

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
should look something like this

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.440 
should look something like this
as<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.320> can<00:04:28.440> see<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:29.160> also<00:04:29.460> attached<00:04:30.180> the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
as you can see I have also attached the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.450 
as you can see I have also attached the
little<00:04:30.720> wheels<00:04:30.930> onto<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.560> bottom<00:04:31.919> I'm<00:04:32.400> just

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
little wheels onto the bottom I'm just

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.790 
little wheels onto the bottom I'm just
using<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.540> couple<00:04:33.750> stitches<00:04:34.020> on<00:04:34.350> each<00:04:34.530> wheel

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
using a couple stitches on each wheel

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.460 
using a couple stitches on each wheel
and<00:04:35.040> I've<00:04:36.030> also<00:04:36.180> added<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.810> little<00:04:37.110> ribbon<00:04:37.380> on

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
and I've also added a little ribbon on

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.260 
and I've also added a little ribbon on
the<00:04:37.590> back<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.010> that's<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.880> like<00:04:39.060> I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
the back and that's so that if I like I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.740 
the back and that's so that if I like I
can<00:04:39.600> add<00:04:39.810> some<00:04:40.050> more<00:04:40.080> carriages<00:04:40.970> so<00:04:41.970> finally

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
can add some more carriages so finally

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.480 
can add some more carriages so finally
this<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.140> one<00:04:43.320> more<00:04:43.470> thing<00:04:43.650> we<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:44.040> do<00:04:44.220> and

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
this is one more thing we have to do and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.880 
this is one more thing we have to do and
that<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.060> taking<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.570> base<00:04:45.750> piece<00:04:46.050> we're<00:04:46.710> gonna

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
that is taking a base piece we're gonna

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.360 
that is taking a base piece we're gonna
put<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.280> piece<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.760> top<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.770> then<00:04:50.040> again

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
put this piece on top and then again

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.909 
put this piece on top and then again
using<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.060> blanket<00:04:51.450> stitch<00:04:51.570> simply<00:04:52.440> sew<00:04:52.650> all

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
the way around the edge to secure that

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.370 
the way around the edge to secure that
in<00:04:55.320> place

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
in place

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.800
