00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.990
 hello everyone in this little 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.290
 videotutorial I bring you the way 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.929
 open your Xbox 360's a 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.669
 quickly and easily the first thing that 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.339
 we must do is create a document 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.230
 of text I already have it I created it and 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.180
 we're going to do there is going to be put 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.750
 necessary information for later 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:27.510
 put it on our xbox 360 once 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.510
 we have it created we open google chrome 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 and up in the address bar 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.960
 We put 192 points 168 point 1.1 which is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 the address of the router 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.050
 here we will get the username and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.750
 the password in my case both are 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.820
 admin on another router can be name of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.930
 user 1234 and password 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 1234 we give you to login and we 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.680
 open the router page once here 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.140
 we give advanced to we are going to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.980
 and there will come out a section that puts 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.650
 mz host we give him and where does he put this 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.240
 small space is to put an ip the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.350
 ip that later we will assign to our 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:21.369
 consoles teams 360 we will put 192 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.890
 points 168 point 1.92 same and we give to 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.950
 save 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.630
 once done this you stay with the ip 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 to put it later in the document of 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.190
 text and we go to the section ns here 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.560
 we will leave this the primary dns and the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.479
 secondary 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.399
 of primary school one more than there is 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.090
 a difference of a number that is 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.369
 add one sometimes five put a 6 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 well what we do is copy this 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.009
 also and we're going to put it in the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.299
 text document as you can see I already 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.840
 I have it here here put the ip the dns 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.510
 primary and secondary once done 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.450
 all this we can close the browser 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.030
 and we go to our xbox 360 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.560
 once here we go to the section 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.030
 system configuration 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.610
 network configuration 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.959
 here we can see that we have both 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.860
 options but I have it in network of 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.860
 cable so we give it 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.599
 and we are going to configure network 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.120
 we see that here we have the dns and what 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.739
 configuration and what we copied before you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.780
 we give configuration and pe and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.880
 we select manual 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.490
 now in ip address what are we going to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.900
 do is going to be put the ip that we put 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:52.920
 in the text document 192 point 10 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.920
 168 point 1.92 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.240
 framed network insurance what 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.270
 we are going to do is put the effect 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:06.160
 resolve to always put 250 and 5,200 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.220
 55,255 zero point 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.560
 and commissioning link we will put the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:20.890
 page where we enter the router in 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:23.190
 this case is 192 points 168 point 1.1 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.290
 we give to ready 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.020
 and now we 're going to the configuration of 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.290
 tns 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.540
 and we also put it in manual 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.549
 we see that here we have the primary and the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.769
 secondary as we have in the document 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.769
 text as well we give the primary 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:46.830
 and here we have to put 87 points 216 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.830
 points 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:56.030
 point 65 now we 're going to secondary and 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.160
 we repeat the same operation but 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:06.400
 putting instead the 5 at the end putting 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:09.560
 the 6 87.216 point 1.66 we give to ready 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.600
 and back 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.600
 we tested connection with xbox live 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:23.140
 and we can see now that everything has 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.140
 gone well and we have the cream open 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.699
