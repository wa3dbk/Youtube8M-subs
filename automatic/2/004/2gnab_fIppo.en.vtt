00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
and like I said I'm not done there's a

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.200 
and like I said I'm not done there's a
lot<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.310> know<00:05:33.340> there's<00:05:33.699> other<00:05:33.820> things<00:05:33.940> that

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
lot you know there's other things that

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.270 
lot you know there's other things that
I'm<00:05:34.300> gonna<00:05:34.389> do<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:34.900> might<00:05:35.710> get<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:35.949> bonded

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
I'm gonna do I might get it bonded

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.040 
I'm gonna do I might get it bonded
together<00:05:36.400> now<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:36.789> it's<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.270> small

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
together now that it's so small

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.740 
together now that it's so small
literally<00:05:38.740> like<00:05:38.830> an<00:05:38.949> end<00:05:39.580> now<00:05:40.300> there's<00:05:40.510> a<00:05:40.600> lot

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
literally like an end now there's a lot

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.629 
literally like an end now there's a lot
smaller<00:05:41.110> I'm<00:05:41.410> probably<00:05:41.949> gonna<00:05:42.130> get<00:05:42.280> it<00:05:42.370> bonded

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
smaller I'm probably gonna get it bonded

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.670 
smaller I'm probably gonna get it bonded
together<00:05:42.900> which<00:05:43.900> will<00:05:44.080> close<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.530> gap

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
together which will close the gap

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.550 
together which will close the gap
forever<00:05:45.210> which<00:05:46.210> means<00:05:46.240> there's<00:05:46.930> no<00:05:47.139> way<00:05:47.169> that

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
forever which means there's no way that

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.820 
forever which means there's no way that
it's<00:05:47.710> going<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.889> come<00:05:48.039> apart<00:05:48.389> so<00:05:49.620> YouTube<00:05:50.620> I

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
it's going to come apart so YouTube I

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.020 
it's going to come apart so YouTube I
mean<00:05:51.010> if<00:05:51.190> you're<00:05:51.370> out<00:05:51.550> there<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:51.880> you're

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
mean if you're out there and you're

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.460 
mean if you're out there and you're
dealing<00:05:52.360> with<00:05:52.389> a<00:05:52.510> gap<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.110> you're<00:05:53.229> not

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
dealing with a gap and you're not

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.250 
dealing with a gap and you're not
confident<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.340> really<00:05:55.210> really<00:05:55.449> really<00:05:55.930> try<00:05:56.229> to

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
confident to really really really try to

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.890 
confident to really really really try to
get<00:05:56.979> these<00:05:57.099> bands<00:05:57.400> and<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:58.240> think<00:05:58.690> that<00:05:58.780> will

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
get these bands and I think that will

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.300 
get these bands and I think that will
boost<00:05:59.139> your<00:05:59.320> confidence<00:05:59.530> a<00:05:59.949> lot<00:06:00.099> I<00:06:00.130> know

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
men it's probably going through it with

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.089 
men it's probably going through it with
the<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:05.020> gaps<00:06:05.289> and<00:06:05.500> stuff<00:06:05.680> and<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.039> I
