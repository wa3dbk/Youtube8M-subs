flashlight serving help so in the back

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.969 
flashlight serving help so in the back
of<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.119> is<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> shown<00:01:39.540> ya<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> kill<00:01:40.530> still

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of that is a shown ya you kill still

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
of that is a shown ya you kill still
can't<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> allows<00:01:42.990> me

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
can't really see it but this allows me

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
can't really see it but this allows me
to<00:01:43.259> monitor<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.680> amps<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> 2<00:01:45.270> bubblers

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to monitor my amps this is a 2 bubblers

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.889 
to monitor my amps this is a 2 bubblers
I<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:46.649> cell<00:01:47.540> over<00:01:48.540> there

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
I got my cell over there

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.120 
I got my cell over there
and<00:01:49.100> all<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> wired<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.939> ground<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.130> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and all it is is wired to ground and it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.060 
and all it is is wired to ground and it
grounds<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.020> panel<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.229> DC<00:01:55.740> DC

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
grounds out the panel or the DC DC

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
grounds out the panel or the DC DC
converter<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.420> cell<00:01:57.659> output<00:01:58.140> swings

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
converter so my cell output swings

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.999 
converter so my cell output swings
around<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.280> I've<00:02:00.119> got<00:02:00.299> my<00:02:00.420> 2<00:02:00.479> bubblers

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
around and I've got my 2 bubblers

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.270 
around and I've got my 2 bubblers
and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.479> goes<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.439> let's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and then this is what goes in so let's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.080 
and then this is what goes in so let's
fire<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> engine<00:02:10.459> all<00:02:11.459> right<00:02:11.640> now<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.030> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
fire up the engine all right now this is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.050 
fire up the engine all right now this is
a<00:02:12.239> manual<00:02:12.720> kill<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:14.400> switch<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.940> be

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
a manual kill so this switch has to be

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.850 
a manual kill so this switch has to be
this<00:02:15.480> guarded<00:02:15.900> switch<00:02:16.110> has<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.349> be<00:02:16.379> up<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.769> on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
this guarded switch has to be up and on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.970 
this guarded switch has to be up and on
for<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.220> system<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.550> operate<00:02:23.840> anyway<00:02:24.980> so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
for this system to operate anyway so

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.250 
for this system to operate anyway so
let's<00:02:26.640> take<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.849> look<00:02:26.970> at<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.239> does<00:02:27.390> we

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
let's take a look at what it does we

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.740 
let's take a look at what it does we
have<00:02:29.040> our<00:02:29.190> power<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:32.209> idle<00:02:33.209> was<00:02:33.420> raised

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
have our power on and idle was raised

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.070 
have our power on and idle was raised
ever<00:02:34.260> slightly<00:02:34.849> when<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.880> turned<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
ever slightly when I turned it on the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.660 
ever slightly when I turned it on the
four<00:02:37.319> squirrel-cage<00:02:37.650> blowers<00:02:38.280> make<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> little

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
four squirrel-cage blowers make a little

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.180 
four squirrel-cage blowers make a little
bit<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.940> noise<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.209> nothing<00:02:39.599> too<00:02:39.750> much<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.470> as

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
bit of noise but nothing too much and as

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.440 
bit of noise but nothing too much and as
you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.489> see<00:02:41.700> we<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> little<00:02:42.269> bit<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
you can see we have a little bit of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.059 
you can see we have a little bit of
activity<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.140> level<00:02:46.739> in<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.829> first

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
activity here so the level in the first

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.110 
activity here so the level in the first
bubbler<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:48.120> little<00:02:48.480> down<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:50.700> thinking

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
bubbler is a little down I'm thinking

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.089 
bubbler is a little down I'm thinking
that<00:02:51.299> when<00:02:51.599> when<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.380> cell<00:02:52.590> eats<00:02:52.799> up<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
that when when this cell eats up and

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.410 
that when when this cell eats up and
cools<00:02:53.280> down<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.519> might<00:02:53.790> expand<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.360> contract

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
cools down I might expand and contract

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.890 
cools down I might expand and contract
and<00:02:54.930> pull<00:02:55.829> some<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.160> back<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.360> figure

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and pull some of this back so I figure

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.270 
and pull some of this back so I figure
might<00:02:58.079> end<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.319> with<00:02:58.470> some<00:02:58.620> electrolyte<00:02:59.099> which

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
might end up with some electrolyte which

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.589 
might end up with some electrolyte which
is<00:02:59.400> why<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.549> had<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> second<00:03:00.150> bubbler<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
is why I had the second bubbler and

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.180 
is why I had the second bubbler and
there's<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.799> third<00:03:02.040> one

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
there's going to be a third one

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.610 
there's going to be a third one
installed<00:03:02.579> right<00:03:02.760> before<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> intake<00:03:03.620> for

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
installed right before the intake for

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.980 
installed right before the intake for
any<00:03:05.190> flashbacks<00:03:05.489> right<00:03:06.079> now<00:03:07.079> we're<00:03:07.290> pulling

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
any flashbacks right now we're pulling

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:18.220 
any flashbacks right now we're pulling
as<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.680> can<00:03:09.800> see<00:03:10.010> 30<00:03:11.860> 33<00:03:14.020> 33<00:03:15.020> amps

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.690 

just<00:03:19.230> about<00:03:19.379> three<00:03:19.680> point<00:03:19.980> nine<00:03:20.010> volts<00:03:20.540> so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
just about three point nine volts so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.849 
just about three point nine volts so
with<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:23.879> cell<00:03:24.180> basically<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:25.439> cell<00:03:25.680> only

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
with this cell basically this cell only

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
have four switch plates in there SMAC

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.250 
have four switch plates in there SMAC
style<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:32.250> more<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.870> plates

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.750 
style and the more you the more plates
you<00:03:34.409> put<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.739> there<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.129> more<00:03:35.159> electrical

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you put in there the more electrical

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.550 
you put in there the more electrical
resistance<00:03:36.239> I've<00:03:36.389> got<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.629> few<00:03:37.019> positive<00:03:37.439> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560

if<00:03:44.519> you've<00:03:44.730> seen<00:03:44.969> my<00:03:45.150> other<00:03:45.180> smacks<00:03:45.989> Deary

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
if you've seen my other smacks Deary

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.720 
if you've seen my other smacks Deary
demonstration<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.099> looks<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.670> that

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
demonstration it looks just like that

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.300 
demonstration it looks just like that
except<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.879> uh<00:03:51.530> obviously<00:03:52.530> got<00:03:52.739> some<00:03:52.950> vpr

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
except it's uh obviously got some vpr

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.890 
except it's uh obviously got some vpr
hardware<00:03:53.669> on<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:53.879> since<00:03:54.180> I'm<00:03:54.329> shoving<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
hardware on it since I'm shoving a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.080 
hardware on it since I'm shoving a
thirty<00:03:55.319> three<00:03:55.530> amperes<00:03:55.919> through<00:03:56.189> it<00:03:56.370> at<00:03:56.669> a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
thirty three amperes through it at a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.020 
thirty three amperes through it at a
four<00:03:57.689> volt<00:03:57.900> but<00:03:58.859> this<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.189> a<00:03:59.220> extremely

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
four volt but this is a extremely

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.259 
four volt but this is a extremely
efficient<00:04:00.720> setup<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.319> had<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.919> have<00:04:02.040> another

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
efficient setup I had to have another

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.399 
efficient setup I had to have another
ammeter<00:04:03.269> I'm<00:04:03.419> going<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.629> add<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
ammeter I'm going to add in on the

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.289 
ammeter I'm going to add in on the
intake<00:04:04.950> side<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:06.000> do<00:04:06.090> some

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
intake side so that I can do some

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.110 
intake side so that I can do some
real-time<00:04:06.689> calculations<00:04:06.959> as<00:04:07.560> far<00:04:07.799> as

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
real-time calculations as far as

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.929 
real-time calculations as far as
efficiency<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.560> let<00:04:10.919> me<00:04:11.010> shut<00:04:11.219> this<00:04:11.370> off<00:04:11.609> for<00:04:11.879> a

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
efficiency so let me shut this off for a

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.959 
efficiency so let me shut this off for a
second<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:13.260> give<00:04:14.129> it<00:04:14.219> a<00:04:14.280> couple<00:04:14.459> seconds

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
second and give it a couple seconds

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:21.680 
second and give it a couple seconds
let's<00:04:15.959> see<00:04:16.109> how<00:04:16.169> my<00:04:16.320> idle<00:04:16.680> does<00:04:16.859> again<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:20.690> mean

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
let's see how my idle does again I mean

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.939 
let's see how my idle does again I mean
that<00:04:21.810> might<00:04:21.959> just<00:04:22.139> be<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:22.289> response<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
that might just be a response to the

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.379 
that might just be a response to the
electrical<00:04:23.370> load<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:23.699> the<00:04:23.760> electrical<00:04:24.240> load

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
electrical load but the electrical load

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.809 
electrical load but the electrical load
is<00:04:24.599> only<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:25.080> six<00:04:26.070> or<00:04:26.220> seven<00:04:26.250> amperes

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
is only like six or seven amperes

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.460 
is only like six or seven amperes
yeah<00:04:29.819> it<00:04:30.060> goes<00:04:30.240> dips<00:04:30.690> down<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:30.960> then<00:04:31.229> back<00:04:31.440> up

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
yeah it goes dips down and then back up

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.670 
yeah it goes dips down and then back up
that<00:04:32.310> might<00:04:32.490> just<00:04:32.639> be<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.879> alternator<00:04:33.680> either

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
that might just be the alternator either

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.879 
that might just be the alternator either
way<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:34.860> have<00:04:35.099> no<00:04:35.960> no<00:04:36.960> way<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.139> gauge<00:04:37.349> any<00:04:37.620> gains

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
way I have no no way to gauge any gains
