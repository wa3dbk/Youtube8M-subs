00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
this whenever they we can't get an EMP

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.290 
this whenever they we can't get an EMP
up<00:02:28.220> or<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.400> don't<00:02:28.459> have<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.670> counter<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.090> just

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
up or we don't have a counter up just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.520 
up or we don't have a counter up just
for<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.420> split<00:02:29.720> second<00:02:30.050> they<00:02:30.140> don't<00:02:30.380> know

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
for that split second they don't know

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.699 
for that split second they don't know
where<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.709> met<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.250> used<00:02:31.580> suppressor<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.780> next

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.059 
the you know you'll really see this on
everything<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.959> should<00:03:03.500> probably<00:03:03.620> use<00:03:03.860> tak

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
everything I should probably use tak

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.910 
everything I should probably use tak
mask<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.489> this<00:03:04.640> but<00:03:04.849> this<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.120> more<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.540> not

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
mask on this but this is more of a not

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.080 
mask on this but this is more of a not
face-to-face<00:03:06.920> combat<00:03:07.459> this<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.819> more<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.000> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
face-to-face combat this is more of a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.970 
face-to-face combat this is more of a
distance<00:03:08.480> combat<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.349> there's<00:03:09.560> no<00:03:09.680> really

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
distance combat so there's no really
