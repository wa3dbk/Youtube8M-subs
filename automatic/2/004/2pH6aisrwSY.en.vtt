00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
night well no it's kind of you know fix

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
night well no it's kind of you know fix
firmly<00:00:54.270> into<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.750> head<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.230> these<00:00:55.379> little

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
firmly into your head with these little

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
firmly into your head with these little
surgical<00:00:56.100> pins<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.379> they<00:00:58.379> don't<00:00:58.590> hurt<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
surgical pins and they don't hurt that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.990 
surgical pins and they don't hurt that
much<00:00:59.579> but<00:01:00.350> certainly<00:01:01.350> walking<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.670> moving

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
much but certainly walking and moving

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
much but certainly walking and moving
around<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.629> helps<00:01:04.259> make<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> pain<00:01:05.100> get

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
around really helps make the pain get

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.430 
around really helps make the pain get
better<00:01:05.789> because<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.450> circulation<00:01:07.170> just

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
better because the circulation just

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.410 
better because the circulation just
brings<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> endorphins<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.149> makes<00:01:09.300> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
brings the endorphins out and makes you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
brings the endorphins out and makes you
feel<00:01:09.630> better<00:01:09.899> so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.130> thought<00:01:11.280> I'd<00:01:11.430> show

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
feel better so I just thought I'd show

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.779 
feel better so I just thought I'd show
you<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:12.180> bit<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.899> nighttime

when I lay down my sister-in-law gave me

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.130 
when I lay down my sister-in-law gave me
a<00:01:33.509> crazy<00:01:33.960> memory<00:01:34.830> foam<00:01:35.070> pillow<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.780> cut<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
a crazy memory foam pillow and I cut it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.010 
a crazy memory foam pillow and I cut it
apart<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.009> made<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.880> size<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
apart and made one this size I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
apart and made one this size I
originally<00:01:40.920> had<00:01:41.100> made<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.700> size<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
originally had made one this size that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
originally had made one this size that
fit<00:01:42.479> between<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.990> bars<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.650> was<00:01:43.770> not

fit between the bars but it was not

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.600 
fit between the bars but it was not
comfortable<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:45.500> memory<00:01:46.500> foam<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
comfortable so memory foam is really a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.870 
comfortable so memory foam is really a
strong<00:01:48.470> bit<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.829> putting<00:01:50.369> pieces<00:01:50.579> together

twerking twisting fashion which is very

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
twerking twisting fashion which is very
gentle<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.769> very<00:03:52.010> easy<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.519> do

supports your lower back so depends I
want<00:04:15.040> your<00:04:15.160> focal<00:04:15.520> length<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.970> if<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.270> need

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
want your focal length is if you need

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.260 
want your focal length is if you need
glasses<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:17.200> kind<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.470> tricky<00:04:17.920> but<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:19.030> works

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270

so I produced a DVD years ago called
focus<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.210> flexibility<00:04:28.900> which<00:04:29.650> turns<00:04:30.010> out<00:04:30.250> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
focus on flexibility which turns out to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.580 
focus on flexibility which turns out to
be<00:04:30.430> very<00:04:30.730> helpful<00:04:31.060> for<00:04:31.450> me<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:31.870> my<00:04:31.990> recovering

be very helpful for me and my recovering
gave<00:04:32.770> me<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:32.920> lot<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.250> understanding<00:04:34.000> about<00:04:34.300> how

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
gave me a lot of understanding about how

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.750 
gave me a lot of understanding about how
the<00:04:34.570> body<00:04:34.840> moves<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:36.130> my<00:04:36.310> book<00:04:36.520> it's

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
the body moves and then my book it's

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.240 
the body moves and then my book it's
never<00:04:37.030> too<00:04:37.270> late<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:38.530> doing<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.920> lot<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.070> the
