00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 today's tutorial is 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:17.390
 the materials for today are a fabric of 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.930
 suede a piece of suede cloth 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.250
 strass ribbon 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:29.020
 fruit cord artisan tongs 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.670
 suitcase type auction 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.670
 gold peak brooch 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.450
 a bit of chain 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.510
 rings 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.510
 scissors 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.920
 and silicone 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.230
 The first thing we are going to do then is 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.760
 begin to apply the silicone in a 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 little piece of cloth that we have 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.810
 then then let's take the tape from 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.930
 strass that we are going to take the measure in the 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.440
 doll leaving a small space of a 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.210
 centimeter and a half more or less to 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.210
 to be able to stick it in the cloth 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.700
 let's start to paste the first layer 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.890
 of the fruit cord for that we're going to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.939
 again silicone again in all 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 the outline and so with much 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.070
 calm let's go placing the cord 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.850
 giving the shape that is leaving us the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 strass ribbon 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.260
 we are getting for small moments 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.659
 until the tape is well attached 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.119
 stay with the shape and once this is done 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.030
 let's repeat the process for the other 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.740
 side and then we will repeat it with the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.740
 following colors that we want to handle 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.569
 to me 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.720
 in the world 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.090
 who was leaving our project 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.980
 let's let it dry and then then 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.250
 let's start trimming all the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 outline with the scissors until we 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.930
 stay with a shape we want 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.930
 Y 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.390
 well once we have cut back then already 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.629
 it's not a project we're going to take the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.659
 bag type auction that is the size of 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.510
 the bracelet we're making and we're going 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:59.430
 to start tightening then with the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.430
 clamps artisan to close 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.989
 once we have placed the auction type 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.569
 suitcase on both sides we have this way 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.470
 our bracelet we go then now to 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.950
 take the ring the peak the gold and the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.950
 chain 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.710
 and let's start by opening the ring 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.060
 to put it through the hole of the auction 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.910
 and then place 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.770
 the gold peak or the brooch that you 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.990
 want to place the closing 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.990
 we repeat the action for the other side 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.050
 again we take the ring we open it 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.760
 we put it through the hole and then 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.760
 then we add the chain 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.480
 well so then our 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.890
 project I hope you liked it
