00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
his left hand anyway Pacquiao attempts a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.449 
his left hand anyway Pacquiao attempts a
right<00:03:05.570> hook<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:05.989> as<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.290> said<00:03:06.350> he<00:03:06.560> always<00:03:06.920> drops

right hook and as I said he always drops
his<00:03:07.610> left<00:03:07.850> hand<00:03:08.060> because<00:03:08.180> he's<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> flawed

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
thing

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.540 
thing
jab<00:04:20.630> slipped<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.380> outside<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.100> he

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
jab slipped to the outside and he

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.310 
jab slipped to the outside and he
