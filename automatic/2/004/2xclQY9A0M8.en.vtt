digital security expert so the way you
guys<00:00:23.909> eat<00:00:24.300> today<00:00:24.599> is<00:00:25.109> wildly<00:00:25.980> inefficient

more<00:00:29.069> about<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.149> do<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.659> we<00:00:30.749> drive

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
more about that what we do so we drive

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
happening is not scalable right we have

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190 
happening is not scalable right we have
to<00:01:11.730> figure<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.180> how<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> feed<00:01:12.690> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:12.990> more

to figure out how to feed a lot more

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.700 
to figure out how to feed a lot more
people<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.110> figure<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.380> how<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> eat

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
people we have to figure out how to eat

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.080 
people we have to figure out how to eat
feed<00:01:17.010> them<00:01:17.190> more<00:01:17.430> efficiently<00:01:20.090> with

feed them more efficiently with

feed them more efficiently with
population<00:01:21.870> growth<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.470> problem<00:01:23.460> gets

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
population growth that problem gets

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.480 
population growth that problem gets
compounded<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.510> another<00:01:24.840> 50%<00:01:25.050> right<00:01:25.920> we

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
compounded by another 50% right we

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.040 
compounded by another 50% right we
figured<00:01:26.760> out<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> feed<00:01:27.240> 50<00:01:27.570> percent<00:01:27.930> more

figured out how to feed 50 percent more
people<00:01:28.260> during<00:01:29.220> your<00:01:29.340> lifetime<00:01:29.870> now<00:01:30.870> we<00:01:30.930> get

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
people during your lifetime now we get

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100 
people during your lifetime now we get
to<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.410> it<00:01:31.530> again<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:33.300> we're<00:01:33.450> looking<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.990> ways

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
to do it again so we're looking for ways

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.670 
to do it again so we're looking for ways
to<00:01:34.170> make<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.550> efficient<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:39.650> one<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to make that more efficient so one of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
to make that more efficient so one of
the<00:01:40.800> other<00:01:40.950> problems<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.300> we<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the other problems is that we don't have

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.560 
the other problems is that we don't have
any<00:01:42.810> data<00:01:42.990> about<00:01:43.880> anything<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> ever<00:01:45.150> ate<00:01:45.390> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
any data about anything you ever ate in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.290 
any data about anything you ever ate in
your<00:01:45.720> entire<00:01:46.050> life<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.830> every<00:01:47.790> other<00:01:47.970> business

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
your entire life in every other business

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.140 
your entire life in every other business
we<00:01:48.900> use<00:01:48.930> computers<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.710> collect<00:01:50.250> data<00:01:50.490> analyze

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
we use computers to collect data analyze

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.540 
we use computers to collect data analyze
the<00:01:51.690> data<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.140> use<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.370> better

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
the data and use that to make better

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.690 
the data and use that to make better
decisions<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.520> with

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
decisions we don't know what to do with

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.290 
decisions we don't know what to do with
food<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:58.020> absolutely<00:01:58.770> ludicrous<00:01:59.270> to<00:02:00.270> think

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
food it's absolutely ludicrous to think

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.010 
food it's absolutely ludicrous to think
that<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.210> by<00:02:03.360> without<00:02:03.570> applying

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that we can get by without applying

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.139 
that we can get by without applying
computers<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:04.740> problem<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:05.370> well<00:02:05.870> so

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
computers to this problem as well so

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.930 
computers to this problem as well so
what<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.269> thinking<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:10.490> robots<00:02:11.490> should<00:02:11.640> make

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
what I'm thinking is robots should make

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.830 
what I'm thinking is robots should make
your<00:02:12.060> food

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
your food

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.680 
your food
and<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.770> robot<00:02:15.069> making<00:02:15.459> your<00:02:15.580> food<00:02:15.819> would<00:02:16.540> know

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
and a robot making your food would know

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.240 
and a robot making your food would know
a<00:02:16.720> lot<00:02:16.989> about<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.560> would<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.040> data

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
a lot about you it would have the data

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.930 
a lot about you it would have the data
about<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.760> made<00:02:18.940> for<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.150> last<00:02:19.209> time<00:02:20.940> so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
about what it made for you last time so

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.710 
about what it made for you last time so
imagine<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.890> machine<00:02:24.000> with<00:02:25.000> three<00:02:25.239> buttons<00:02:25.599> on

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
imagine a machine with three buttons on

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.900 
imagine a machine with three buttons on
it<00:02:26.340> what<00:02:27.340> i<00:02:27.370> yesterday<00:02:28.170> what<00:02:29.170> my<00:02:29.349> friends<00:02:29.680> like

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
