00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
springs in one in each hole and then you

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.950 
springs in one in each hole and then you
put<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.210> other<00:00:36.260> clip<00:00:38.300> feed<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
something like this this is where it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.869 
something like this this is where it's
gonna<00:00:46.140> want<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.590> away<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.399> by

gonna want to get away from you and by
the<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.840> put<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.820> turntable<00:00:50.820> just

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the way you put the turntable just

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.020 
the way you put the turntable just
protect<00:00:52.020> early<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> motor<00:00:53.640> board

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
protect early back into the motor board

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
protect early back into the motor board
because<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> don't<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.710> pushed

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
because you don't want this to be pushed

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.010 
because you don't want this to be pushed
up<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> air<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.660> gets

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
up in the air see this if that gets

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.389 
up in the air see this if that gets
pushed<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> air<00:00:58.680> won't<00:00:58.859> let<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.219> put

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
pushed up in the air won't let you put

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
pushed up in the air won't let you put
this<00:00:59.520> back<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> turn<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.559> till<00:01:01.770> it's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this back on so I turn this till it's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
this back on so I turn this till it's
exactly<00:01:02.579> pointing<00:01:03.180> toward<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:03.719> holes

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
exactly pointing toward the two holes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.100 
exactly pointing toward the two holes
and<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.100> drop<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.640> down<00:01:05.939> onto<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.840> get

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and then I drop this down onto here get

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
and then I drop this down onto here get
the<00:01:07.260> springs<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.159> okay<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the springs down there okay that's the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.800 
the springs down there okay that's the
easy<00:01:09.750> part<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.500> next<00:01:11.280> part<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.970> put<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
easy part the next part is to put the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.039 
easy part the next part is to put the
two<00:01:13.490> separators<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> enter<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> lock

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
two separators you have to enter a lock

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.039 
two separators you have to enter a lock
these<00:01:16.350> two<00:01:16.650> things<00:01:16.979> they'll<00:01:17.790> only<00:01:17.970> fit<00:01:18.780> one

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
these two things they'll only fit one

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190 
these two things they'll only fit one
way<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> they<00:01:22.049> look

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
way just like that so that they look

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
way just like that so that they look
like<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.659> grabber<00:01:24.689> tangs

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
like that so that the two grabber tangs

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.510 
like that so that the two grabber tangs
are<00:01:25.619> facing<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> bakelite<00:01:27.630> parts

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
are facing down into the bakelite parts

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
are facing down into the bakelite parts
you<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.790> drop<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you just drop them down on here and you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.980 
you just drop them down on here and you
make<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.689> one

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
make sure that one of them is in one

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
make sure that one of them is in one
side<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> them<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> other

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
side and one of them is in the other

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.770 
side and one of them is in the other
side<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.890> takes<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.400> practice<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
side it takes some practice don't be you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.300 
side it takes some practice don't be you
know<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.320> discouraged<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.009> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
shelves a little bit against the springs

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
smooth that is make sure that the bottom

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.920 
smooth that is make sure that the bottom
shelf<00:04:37.710> comes<00:04:38.010> out<00:04:38.250> as<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.850> top<00:04:39.090> shelf<00:04:39.510> the

shelf comes out as the top shelf the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.750 
shelf comes out as the top shelf the
separator<00:04:40.470> goes<00:04:40.740> out<00:04:40.949> to<00:04:41.130> hold<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.400> records

separator goes out to hold the records
up<00:04:41.940> make<00:04:42.510> sure<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.810> happens<00:04:43.199> on<00:04:43.350> both<00:04:43.380> sides

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
up make sure it happens on both sides

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.640 
up make sure it happens on both sides
and<00:04:44.699> there<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.120> just<00:04:45.810> as<00:04:45.990> good<00:04:46.139> as<00:04:46.260> new
