I'm<00:00:21.740> going<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:21.920> do<00:00:22.130> is<00:00:22.910> we're<00:00:23.840> going<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:23.990> have

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
I'm going to do is we're going to have

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.400 
I'm going to do is we're going to have
fast-track<00:00:24.920> on<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.270> one<00:00:26.449> side<00:00:26.690> of<00:00:26.869> log<00:00:27.110> loader

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
fast-track on the one side of log loader

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.310 
fast-track on the one side of log loader
and<00:00:28.119> then<00:00:29.119> I'm<00:00:29.330> going<00:00:29.510> to<00:00:29.539> transition<00:00:30.080> from

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
and then I'm going to transition from

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.150 
and then I'm going to transition from
fast-track<00:00:31.279> to<00:00:31.580> super<00:00:32.059> streets<00:00:32.480> on<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.010> other

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
fast-track to super streets on the other

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.119 
fast-track to super streets on the other
side<00:00:34.659> that<00:00:35.659> works<00:00:35.899> out<00:00:36.140> best<00:00:36.379> because<00:00:36.920> I'm

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
side that works out best because I'm

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.379 
side that works out best because I'm
using<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.960> rail<00:00:38.960> King<00:00:39.609> operating<00:00:40.609> log<00:00:40.879> dump<00:00:41.179> car

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:41.389 
using a rail King operating log dump car

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:46.719 
using a rail King operating log dump car
and<00:00:42.399> with<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.550> height<00:00:43.729> of<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.030> sides<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:46.370> kind

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
and with the height of the sides it kind

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:48.430 
and with the height of the sides it kind
of<00:00:46.819> interferes<00:00:47.479> with<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.839> hook<00:00:48.079> if

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
of interferes with the hook if

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.069 
of interferes with the hook if
fast-track<00:00:49.190> was<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:49.489> both<00:00:49.670> sides<00:00:49.999> one<00:00:50.780> side

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
fast-track was on both sides one side

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.079 
fast-track was on both sides one side
the<00:00:51.649> log<00:00:51.979> loader<00:00:52.190> needs<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.609> be<00:00:52.729> up<00:00:52.850> higher

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
the log loader needs to be up higher

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.520 
the log loader needs to be up higher
than<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.479> other<00:00:53.629> side<00:00:54.399> so<00:00:55.399> I<00:00:56.079> got<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.260> track

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
than the other side so I got the track

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.369 
than the other side so I got the track
voltage<00:00:59.109> set<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.319> 13<00:01:00.769> bolts<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:03.049> just<00:01:03.229> want

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
voltage set the 13 bolts and I just want

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:16.930 
voltage set the 13 bolts and I just want
to<00:01:03.440> show<00:01:03.619> how<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:03.920> works<00:01:15.190> when<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.340> dump<00:01:16.610> side

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
to show how it works when the dump side

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.230 
to show how it works when the dump side
I<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.290> normal<00:01:18.740> line<00:01:19.010> 'el<00:01:19.720> log<00:01:20.720> dump<00:01:21.050> car
