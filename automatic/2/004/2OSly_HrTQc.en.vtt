00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 WEST IN IRELAND 

00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:19.120
 - Sergeant Gerry Boyle "Cop Shop". A SHOE OF STARS 

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:21.311
 - What was that? A sheep? - A lamb. 

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:25.015
 "I mean what your parents would say." WORKS WITH WELLNESS 

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.050
 - I have information about yesterday's murder. - What murder? 

00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.245
 How many murders did you have in the last 24 hours? 

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:32.040
 Well, it's enough if we know. 

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:33.440
 DEBAUCHERY 

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.305
 I wish I had my handcuffs. 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.020
 AND DRYING 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.500
 I don't think your mom would be very happy about this now. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500
 UNTIL NOW 

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.985
 We're going to get a briefing from the guy who came from the FBI. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.023
 And these people are dangerous. Nearly $ 500 million worth of cocaine on board. 

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:56.680
 - Yes, Sergeant? - I thought only black people could be dealers. 

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.740
 - And the Mexicans. - Apologize to the Lord. - Sorry? Why? 

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:04.715
 - For example, a racist outrage. - I am Irish, sir, racism is part of my culture. 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.640
 PERFECT SUMMER MUSEUM 

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.635
 I thought we could start exploring the area. 

00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:17.015
 Sorry, I missed "so". 

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:20.700
 - I'd like to ask a few questions. - There's a black man at the door. 

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.883
 It is a Celtic-speaking countryside. Didn't you teach this on Langley? 

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:26.620
 How's my lord? Sir? 

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:29.900
 Langley is the CIA, you're an idiot, not an FBI. 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.200
 GLEESON AND CHEADLE'S UNLIMITED SPIRIT 

00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:35.350
 I can't decide if you're really stupid or very clever. 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.410
 - Are you okay? - Just a headache. 

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:39.920
 There, look! 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.980
 - Have you been shot? - And. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.115
 Hurt? 

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:51.300
 - So she grew up in the housing estate. - No, not there. 

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:57.625
 I really have a very upscale background. 

00:01:57.692 --> 00:01:59.643
 Summer holidays in the hampton countryside, skiing in Aspen. 

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.180
 I thought the blacks couldn't ski. 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.187
 Or swim? 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.200
 A GUARDIS
