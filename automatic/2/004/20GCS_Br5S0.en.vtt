 has come from that time to today 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.160
 the competition always falls against the politician's own she lives 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.850
 I think so 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.940
 these find something external 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.839
 different figures on the debate 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.309
 I think this is very special 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:42.659
 would like to know how that is possible then it should be nice higher powers 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.729
 thereby alpro because simply so to realize 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.869
 and that this will become van der kunstraat 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.689
 exhibited 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.119
 What do you think of 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.119
 that the Turkish consulate will stop this system 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.040
 very admirable and also very important 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.469
 and i am a dutch grower from here in the netherlands the all 33 years and i live 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:13.230

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:17.209
 admire it because we can get it connected 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.379

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.660

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.020

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.649
 creative people up 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:35.009
