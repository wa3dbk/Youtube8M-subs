00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
together and that's when there's some

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.860 
together and that's when there's some
sort<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.720> syndrome<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:35.520> creates<00:00:35.970> pain<00:00:36.420> and

sort of syndrome that creates pain and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.060 
sort of syndrome that creates pain and
is<00:00:37.170> changing<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> horse<00:00:38.460> moves

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
is changing the way the horse moves

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.849 
is changing the way the horse moves
typically<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.450> am<00:00:42.450> tipped<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.109> a<00:00:43.500> horse

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
typically I am tipped off that a horse

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.760 
typically I am tipped off that a horse
maybe<00:00:44.309> having<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.000> musculoskeletal<00:00:45.510> issue<00:00:46.170> if

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
maybe having a musculoskeletal issue if

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.029 
maybe having a musculoskeletal issue if
I<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> new<00:00:47.850> flare<00:00:48.329> developing<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> hoof

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I see a new flare developing on a hoof

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.340 
I see a new flare developing on a hoof
that<00:00:50.070> previously<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.300> wearing<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> nice

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that previously was wearing in a nice

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.119 
that previously was wearing in a nice
balanced<00:00:53.100> pattern<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.960> flare<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.010> be

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
balanced pattern so a flare can be

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
balanced pattern so a flare can be
caused<00:00:56.340> by<00:00:56.370> many<00:00:56.609> different<00:00:57.149> things<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
caused by many different things but

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
caused by many different things but
essentially<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> looks<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.210> an

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
essentially what it looks like is an

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.160 
essentially what it looks like is an
excessive<00:01:01.320> wall<00:01:01.679> growth<00:01:02.550> usually<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.780> either

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
excessive wall growth usually on either

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560 
excessive wall growth usually on either
the<00:01:04.410> lateral<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.250> medial<00:01:05.280> side<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.360> hoof

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the lateral or medial side of the hoof

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.290 
the lateral or medial side of the hoof
although<00:01:07.470> toe<00:01:07.890> flares<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.520> occur<00:01:08.820> sometimes

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
although toe flares can occur sometimes

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.920 
although toe flares can occur sometimes
as<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:09.690> if<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.460> new<00:01:11.850> flare<00:01:12.270> developing

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
as well if I see a new flare developing

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
as well if I see a new flare developing
in<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.110> horse<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.650> previously<00:01:14.220> balanced

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
in a horse that was previously balanced

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.749 
in a horse that was previously balanced
I<00:01:15.650> suspect<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:17.040> musculoskeletal

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I suspect that there's musculoskeletal

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.420 
I suspect that there's musculoskeletal
pain<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> horse<00:01:19.470> has<00:01:19.650> changed<00:01:20.189> its

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pain and that the horse has changed its

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.940 
pain and that the horse has changed its
pattern<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.119> movement<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.200> avoid<00:01:22.530> loading

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
pattern of movement to avoid loading

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
pattern of movement to avoid loading
either<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.579> limb<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.840> hoof<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> way

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
either the limb or the hoof in a way

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.620 
either the limb or the hoof in a way
that<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.770> painful<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> time

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that is painful this would be the time

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.410 
that is painful this would be the time
when<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:27.899> refer<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> client<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.520> Amanda

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
when I would refer the client to Amanda

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.920 
when I would refer the client to Amanda
so<00:01:31.430> when<00:01:32.430> Anne<00:01:32.729> lets<00:01:33.000> me<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.689> horse

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so when Anne lets me know that the horse

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.039 
so when Anne lets me know that the horse
has<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> new<00:01:34.590> flare<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.159> its<00:01:35.310> hoof<00:01:35.780> one<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
has a new flare in its hoof one of the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.560 
has a new flare in its hoof one of the
things<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.740> look<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.399> what<00:01:39.000> kind

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
things that I will look at is what kind

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.940 
things that I will look at is what kind
of<00:01:39.750> movement<00:01:40.320> has<00:01:40.710> changed<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.240> caused<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
of movement has changed that caused it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.569 
of movement has changed that caused it
if<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.219> horse<00:01:44.520> has<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.869> pain<00:01:46.469> in<00:01:46.920> its

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
if the horse has a pain in its

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.850 
if the horse has a pain in its
musculoskeletal<00:01:48.210> system<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.439> has<00:01:49.619> recently

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
musculoskeletal system that has recently

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
musculoskeletal system that has recently
cropped<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.640> that's<00:01:51.299> something<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> would

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
cropped up that's something that I would

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.469 
cropped up that's something that I would
address<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.799> chiropractic<00:01:53.430> care<00:01:53.670> for

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
address with chiropractic care for

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
address with chiropractic care for
instance<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> horse<00:01:55.590> had<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.829> flare<00:01:56.250> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
instance if the horse had a flare on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.870 
instance if the horse had a flare on
this<00:01:56.789> right<00:01:57.090> front<00:01:57.509> foot<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.710> were<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.130> the

this right front foot and it were on the
lateral<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.840> outside<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> hoof<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.850> would

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
lateral the outside of the hoof I would

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990 
lateral the outside of the hoof I would
look<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> joints<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.460> base<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
look at the joints in the base of the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.920 
look at the joints in the base of the
neck<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.530> right<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.460> I'd<00:02:09.300> also<00:02:09.479> look

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
neck on the right here and I'd also look

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.680 
neck on the right here and I'd also look
at<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.350> right<00:02:10.560> shoulder<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:12.210> what<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
at the right shoulder and see what is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 
at the right shoulder and see what is
going<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.200> up<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.650> structure<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.310> would

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
going on up in that structure that would

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.120 
going on up in that structure that would
have<00:02:14.850> caused<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.420> horse<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:16.170> change<00:02:16.590> how<00:02:16.920> it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
have caused the horse to change how it's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.800 
have caused the horse to change how it's
moving<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:19.140> resulted<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.069> flare<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
moving that resulted in the flare the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.900 
moving that resulted in the flare the
flared<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
flared so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.780 
flared so
can<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.410> relatively<00:02:24.410> easily<00:02:24.790> corrected

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
can be relatively easily corrected

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.880 
can be relatively easily corrected
depending<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.770> how<00:02:27.770> long<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.610> been<00:02:28.760> going<00:02:28.850> on

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
depending on how long it's been going on

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.620 
depending on how long it's been going on
but<00:02:30.890> what<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.040> usually<00:02:31.520> find<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.150> instance

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
but what I usually find in this instance

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.870 
but what I usually find in this instance
when<00:02:32.870> there's<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.110> new<00:02:33.350> Flair<00:02:33.880> accompanied

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
when there's a new Flair accompanied

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.240 
when there's a new Flair accompanied
with<00:02:35.120> decreased<00:02:35.750> performance<00:02:36.470> or<00:02:36.680> pain<00:02:36.950> is

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
with decreased performance or pain is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.150 
with decreased performance or pain is
that<00:02:38.150> even<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.810> remove<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.530> Flair<00:02:39.860> if

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
that even if I remove the Flair if

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.300 
that even if I remove the Flair if
there's<00:02:40.940> no<00:02:41.210> work<00:02:42.200> done<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.800> body<00:02:43.010> or<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
there's no work done on the body or the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.400 
there's no work done on the body or the
body<00:02:43.550> issues<00:02:43.910> aren't<00:02:44.090> addressed<00:02:44.480> by<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.930> next

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
body issues aren't addressed by the next

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.310 
body issues aren't addressed by the next
trim<00:02:45.740> that<00:02:46.400> flare<00:02:46.730> will<00:02:46.970> return<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.110> it's

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
trim that flare will return so it's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.460 
trim that flare will return so it's
another<00:02:48.650> instance<00:02:49.250> where<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:50.360> really<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:51.230> to
