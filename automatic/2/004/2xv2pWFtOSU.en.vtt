00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.020
 The pants get used to my legs 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.930
 I really like that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.730
 Do you want us to turn back again? 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.800
 No, I would care for it 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.380
 why are you coming to the breaking point 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.640
 head for nothing in a few minutes listening to it 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.950
 to rain again 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:41.010
 How did you know that? 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 times the sky do I mean it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.200
 You see, you have to decide 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 Do we want to go on or do we want 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 turning back 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.630
 we clarify in no case finally 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 i carry the responsibility i know what 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 is possible 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.180
 they do not know me yet but I give 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.180
 never follow me 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.090
 the way i try is 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.530
 not only what I as a teacher 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.760
 were not trained as climbers 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.760
 at home 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:31.659
 heidi peter 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.790
 In the rain, it should overdo it 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.340
 not again heidi and Peter know each other 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.340
 Here's what they say 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 with good wine 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.690
 is going through in a long wide way 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 a forest and then it came on one 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.220
 glade with a beautiful 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.690
 they are so beautiful many thousands of flowers 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.490
 blue bellflowers and yellow ones 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.100
 Key flowers growing on the meadow 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.020
 and changed his little head with that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.069
 It's actually an exercise for grandmother 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.200
 road edge 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.359
 the little red riding hood we flÃ¼ck the flowers and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.549
 all of a sudden I got lost 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:33.159
 I lost my letter got me 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:34.959
 I may run says a once 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.150
 softly agree with us we are the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.299
 seven dwarfs probably behind the seven 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.370
 We have a small hut and 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.310
 77 pieces are and seven valleys there and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.150
 seven and we need somebody 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.620
 who was making for us today clean 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.989
 not always snow white at the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.919
 zwergen 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.769
 of course, the snow white was the 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.639
 Clean but that was before you 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.889
 got married 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.419
 So that's new to me you mean 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.099
 Little Red Riding Hood has fast girls 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.099
 watch out for the dwarves 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
 it will immediately look like it 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.220
 your world is the mountains 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.060
 you're up here at home 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.970
 st 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.970

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.030
