00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 also like this in photoshop what 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.650
 first thing we're going to do is change the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.610
 tires take out I have 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.770
 the PNG and the copy where the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.520
 self-control we are going to reduce it by 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.820
 while we are going to improve problems 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.449
 we change layer and with the brush of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.960
 black color hardens to 0 let's paint 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 the previous lack so you do not notice 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.700
 well more or less like that control of another 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.170
 Once we forgive we will give you control 3 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.310
 control ta santa and accommodate more or 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.430
 less there 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.920
 the tournaments of professional good as well 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.150
 Now we are going to pass another tire for 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.310
 put it on the other rubber control plus or 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.380
 except there good is that we have changed 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.840
 saves now what we do with 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.590
 the car is to lower it let's grab the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.560
 pen tool and let's go to the layer 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.320
 1 to the classroom layer we are going to make a 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.520
 selection 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.100
 of the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.079
 the author's pair does not have to be very 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.120
 perfect no matter how 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.250
 trimmed when they close debris 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.450
 here the layouts to prepare a 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:28.240
 control and lower a bit against the j 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.240
 walsh there are controls 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.460
 and then as already got off after what 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.670
 let's do let's grab the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 patch tool and let's move if 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.170
 they want they can erase it with a brush 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.930
 the same color of the wolf sun forum and 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.909
 I'm going to paint it the same color as 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.119
 good background I've already deleted it from the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.470
 antenna I have lowered taxes income what 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.189
 next we're going to do with a car 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.110
 We are going to cover the handles of the 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.570
 doors now that I already cut my 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.770
 mail handle I will pass it where it is 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.760
 the car we are going to use a little zoom 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.540
 let's rotate the good pretty much like that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.709
 let's move on 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.840
 another covers handle where the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.560
 self-control t 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 the turns 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.299
 and accommodates it 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.299
 to your taste 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.890
