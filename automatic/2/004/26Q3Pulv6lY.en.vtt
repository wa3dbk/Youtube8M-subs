 to win but to lose insurance that 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.470
 you have lost something on the beach 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.660
 Of course it is the worst place because 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.460
 then to see who finds it clear that 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.620
 these men are some experts are 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.160
 pedro treasure hunters that we arrived 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.200
 late 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.050
 after the party there is no one who 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.000
 lift up with the first light of the day Jesus 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.840
 and his team come on let's go 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 they have several hours ahead you seem 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 Ghostbusters you remember all the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 ghost hunter still having a pint 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 like yours more or less but nothing 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.550
 farther from reality 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.500
 the pedro pedro 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.079
 and jesus ghost hunters of vilanova and the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.089
 geltrÃº barcelona 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.649
 but good here what we do is walk 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.610
 through the countryside a little walk with the 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.220
 Beach 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.990
 Carlos a small wage with four 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.510
 euros that people have lost when they 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.330
 they bathe so that the expectation and what 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.900
 it just seems like it's ten cents 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 man for the same vermouth does not reach us 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.780
 but already for an olive or what is that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.790
 to start is fine here one does not have 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.410
 have plans in the morning I guess 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.370
 that you have to come with all the time of 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.370
 world and with great patience 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.510
 to see what comes out does not take you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.130
 Here is a digital detector 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.619
 digital metals 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.369
 this has cost him pedro this has 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.369
 cost then 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.880
 200,000 300,000 pesetas therefore 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 I understand that here is more of a hobby than 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.040
 desire to amortize the device not 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.060
 amortized this is to distract yourself 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060
 it does not just come out 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.920
 there there he attracted there senator 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.890
 and you should already know from experience 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.880
 what is a can 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.880
 a disappointment 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.410
 we have come to make medium holes 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.430
 subway and find a can we throw it to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.709
 trash like this we collaborate with the medium 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:23.120
 around here this appears 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.690
 a beer plug and out there 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.140
 since this can hurt and here that 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.930
 it sounds 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.120
 good man this is that he already has I do not know 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.030
 if much more value something that you 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.980
 you often find also basically 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.620
 what is found is jewelery of this 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.090
 cheap of the people who have come the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.270
 night of san juan has taken four 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.060
 beers or at night 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.250
 couples that are spending a little while 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.390
 better is someone who asked his hand to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.970
 the partner and told him that at night 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.920
 that's why he told him that nothing and you 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.290
 I'm going to ask the typical question but this 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.150
 reportage can not miss that is the most 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.490
 curious that you have found 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.640
 tracing the beach 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.150
 a very handsome ring a ring and I thought 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.430
 you were going to say something else 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.080
 or less a car because it makes a bundle 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.060
 but something like more 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.900
 a ring this hobbie brings together many 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.260
 tracking fans close in 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.770
 beaches occasions to compete and even 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.040
 they have their own magazine detection and 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.730
 coins 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.730
 and I have 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.040
 good 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.800
 and a ring does not 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.920
 I do not know if this is good or not I will 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.500
 I see all the same, I do not know, it looks like gold 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.180
 German here 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.290
 we're going halfway or how the thing is going 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.290
 as if it has a lot of value 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.909
 to see if now I will be the one 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.520
 find here coins of the kings 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:11.640
 Catholics look there is 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.890
 50 cents and we go halfway but I 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.459
 now I have no change either case already 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.289
 I'll give it later 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.330
 a beer with 50 cents 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.810
 what has been achieved today perhaps does not 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.810
 much 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.949
 Y 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.960
 more or less one of 50 one of 10 a 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.990
 ring 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.210
 we will have to keep looking for the waiting 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.210
 find the hidden treasure
