00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.690 

this<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.700> demonstration<00:00:30.120> of<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.780> one<00:00:31.080> o'clock

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
this is a demonstration of a one o'clock

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:55.569 
this is a demonstration of a one o'clock
combination<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:33.000> hand<00:00:33.270> changes

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.100 

okay<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.449> thing<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.660> we're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
okay the first thing that we're going to

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.160 
okay the first thing that we're going to
look<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.769> actual<00:00:58.890> hand<00:00:59.280> change<00:00:59.579> itself

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
look at is the actual hand change itself

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.040 
look at is the actual hand change itself
the<00:01:01.170> Hang<00:01:01.379> change<00:01:01.680> starts<00:01:02.329> from<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.600> outward

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
the Hang change starts from an outward

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.050 
the Hang change starts from an outward
circle<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.009> movement<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
circle so it's that movement there and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.350 
circle so it's that movement there and
that's<00:01:06.540> where<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.899> change<00:01:07.110> -1<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.950> middle<00:01:08.360> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that's where we change -1 the middle so

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
that's where we change -1 the middle so
there<00:01:09.509> we<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.380> change<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> comes<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
there we go and change it comes to here

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820 
there we go and change it comes to here
well<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:12.840> position<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> left<00:01:13.590> hand

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
well about this position the left hand

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.300 
well about this position the left hand
comes<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.450> hand<00:01:15.720> leaves<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
comes up the right hand leaves as the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.389 
comes up the right hand leaves as the
club<00:01:17.580> comes<00:01:17.940> over<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.590> gravity<00:01:20.130> soft

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
club comes over and the gravity soft

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.050 
club comes over and the gravity soft
pulling<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.780> slides<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:22.679> my<00:01:22.920> hand<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> then

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pulling it slides into my hand and then

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.090 
pulling it slides into my hand and then
I<00:01:24.149> feel<00:01:24.360> completely<00:01:24.840> circle<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> bring<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I feel completely circle and bring it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.210 
I feel completely circle and bring it
back<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.399> order<00:01:26.759> again

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
back to order again

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
back to order again
so<00:01:29.220> we'll<00:01:29.399> just<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.700> slowly<00:01:30.030> through<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so we'll just go slowly through that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.830 
so we'll just go slowly through that
again<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.289> do<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.770> me<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:33.300> outlet

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
again so you can do it with me so outlet

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.570 
again so you can do it with me so outlet
and<00:01:34.679> change<00:01:35.630> slides<00:01:37.610> order<00:01:40.190> outward<00:01:41.190> and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
and change slides order outward and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.690 
and change slides order outward and
change<00:01:42.590> slide<00:01:43.610> order<00:01:46.909> outward<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.630> change

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
change slide order outward and change

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.400 
change slide order outward and change
slide<00:01:50.750> order<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.590> club<00:01:52.920> should<00:01:53.130> end<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.580> here

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
so that the button is just say at the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.889 
so that the button is just say at the
level<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.580> finger<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
level of the little finger here the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.449 
level of the little finger here the
third<00:02:01.200> finger<00:02:01.560> should<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.920> comfortably

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
third finger should be comfortably

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.639 
third finger should be comfortably
sitting<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.119> top<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.660> button<00:02:03.869> itself<00:02:04.289> or

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
sitting on top of the button itself or

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.919 
sitting on top of the button itself or
the<00:02:04.860> ball<00:02:08.000> okay<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.239> I'm<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> do<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the ball okay now I'm going to do this a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.559 
the ball okay now I'm going to do this a
little<00:02:10.140> bit<00:02:10.289> quicker<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.330> round

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
little bit quicker so this time round

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.350 
little bit quicker so this time round
rather<00:02:13.470> than<00:02:13.680> changing<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.879> come<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.239> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
rather than changing you can come in to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.540 
rather than changing you can come in to
order<00:02:15.569> position<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.680> stop<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.220> here

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
order position here and stop in here

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.059 
order position here and stop in here
we're<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> float<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.050> club<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.950> we're

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
we're going to float the club so we're

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.940 
we're going to float the club so we're
going<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> pendulum<00:02:21.090> float<00:02:21.830> when<00:02:22.830> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
going to do a pendulum float when it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
going to do a pendulum float when it
comes<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.090> club's<00:02:24.390> reversing

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
comes to here and the club's reversing

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.520 
comes to here and the club's reversing
and<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.940> carry<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> hand

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and we can carry on and do the hand

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.949 
and we can carry on and do the hand
changes<00:02:28.950> again<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.560> outward<00:02:31.560> man<00:02:32.069> change

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
changes again so outward man change

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:44.319 
changes again so outward man change
float<00:02:35.840> swing<00:02:36.840> back<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.269> change<00:02:39.349> float<00:02:40.760> back

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.420 

so<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.420> should<00:02:45.629> feel<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.140> plug<00:02:46.469> just<00:02:47.129> gently

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
so you should feel the plug just gently

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.690 
so you should feel the plug just gently
sliding<00:02:47.969> into<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.250> every<00:02:50.250> time<00:02:50.489> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
sliding into you and every time you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000 
sliding into you and every time you
swing<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> club<00:02:51.329> through<00:02:51.750> into<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.680> out<00:02:52.829> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
swing the club through into the out of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.119 
swing the club through into the out of
position<00:02:53.519> because<00:02:54.390> you're<00:02:54.780> going<00:02:55.129> horizontal

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
position because you're going horizontal

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.390 
position because you're going horizontal
here<00:02:56.519> if<00:02:57.209> there's<00:02:58.049> enough<00:02:58.319> momentum<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.980> swing

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
here if there's enough momentum to swing

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.490 
here if there's enough momentum to swing
the<00:02:59.700> club<00:02:59.879> through<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.719> slide<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.319> into

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the club through and to slide it into

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.399 
the club through and to slide it into
the<00:03:01.620> parlor<00:03:02.189> hand<00:03:03.200> okay<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.230> can

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
the parlor hand okay now so you can

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.899 
the parlor hand okay now so you can
practice<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:08.400> before<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:08.700> go

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
practice that a little bit before we go

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:09.860 
practice that a little bit before we go
on<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> next<00:03:09.329> thing

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
on to the next thing

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.250 
on to the next thing
now<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.370> next<00:03:11.670> part<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.480> elbow

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
now the next part of this is elbow

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.860 
now the next part of this is elbow
circles<00:03:13.739> over<00:03:14.069> circles<00:03:14.519> are<00:03:14.760> basically<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
circles over circles are basically the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.099 
circles over circles are basically the
elbows<00:03:16.260> go<00:03:16.290> tight<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.129> torso<00:03:17.669> and<00:03:18.109> the

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
elbows go tight to the torso and the

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.569 
elbows go tight to the torso and the
club<00:03:19.349> swung<00:03:19.739> through<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.280> that's<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
club swung through so that's the

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.390 
club swung through so that's the
outwards<00:03:21.120> circle<00:03:22.669> in<00:03:23.669> with<00:03:23.939> circle<00:03:25.099> in<00:03:26.099> one

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
outwards circle in with circle in one

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.679 
outwards circle in with circle in one
circle<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.989> do<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.409> left<00:03:30.409> outward<00:03:31.409> circle

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689 
circle we do the left outward circle

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.459 
circle we do the left outward circle
outward<00:03:33.689> circle<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.579> circle<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:37.290> one

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
outward circle in with circle in one

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.830 
outward circle in with circle in one
circle<00:03:37.969> so<00:03:38.969> now<00:03:39.180> we're<00:03:39.299> going<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.480> join<00:03:39.689> them

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
circle so now we're going to join them

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.229 
circle so now we're going to join them
together<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.829> we're<00:03:41.370> going<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.639> do<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.769> circle

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
together and we're going to do a circle

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.280 
together and we're going to do a circle
change<00:03:45.239> circle<00:03:46.579> float<00:03:47.780> reverse<00:03:48.780> change

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
change circle float reverse change

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:59.949 
change circle float reverse change
circle<00:03:50.159> change<00:03:50.959> circle<00:03:54.500> change<00:03:55.500> circle<00:03:56.930> but

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:09.679 

change<00:04:01.519> circle<00:04:02.519> foot<00:04:05.180> okay<00:04:08.060> now<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.659> next

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
change circle foot okay now the next

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.999 
change circle foot okay now the next
thing<00:04:10.169> is<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.650> outward<00:04:10.859> reverse<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:13.560> outward

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.009 
thing is the outward reverse the outward

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.339 
thing is the outward reverse the outward
reverse<00:04:14.370> basically<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.750> one<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.109> end

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
reverse basically is the one of the end

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.460 
reverse basically is the one of the end
movements<00:04:17.389> in<00:04:18.389> this<00:04:18.659> in<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.079> combination

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
movements in this in the combination

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.879 
movements in this in the combination
that<00:04:19.889> reverses<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:21.000> club<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:22.169> rather<00:04:22.560> than

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
that reverses the club but rather than

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.730 
that reverses the club but rather than
just<00:04:22.949> doing<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.550> float<00:04:23.940> reverse<00:04:24.389> which<00:04:25.349> is<00:04:25.530> that

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
just doing a float reverse which is that

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.670 
just doing a float reverse which is that
one<00:04:25.919> I've<00:04:26.099> just<00:04:26.340> shown<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:27.050> what<00:04:28.050> we<00:04:28.199> do<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.500> we

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
one I've just shown you what we do is we

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.890 
one I've just shown you what we do is we
swing<00:04:28.949> the<00:04:29.099> club<00:04:29.280> inward<00:04:30.240> because<00:04:30.599> it's<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
swing the club inward because it's the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.110 
swing the club inward because it's the
gun<00:04:31.139> coming<00:04:31.590> out<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:32.039> being<00:04:32.250> with<00:04:32.490> circle<00:04:33.000> at

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
gun coming out of being with circle at

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.700 
gun coming out of being with circle at
the<00:04:33.150> end<00:04:33.320> outward<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:35.490> from<00:04:35.940> here<00:04:36.710> rather

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
the end outward and now from here rather

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.140 
the end outward and now from here rather
than<00:04:37.919> carrying<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.490> all<00:04:38.610> over<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.940> club

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
than carrying that all over the club

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.130 
than carrying that all over the club
going<00:04:39.509> in<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.780> upward

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
going in the upward

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.830 
going in the upward
we<00:04:41.560> draw<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:41.920> club<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.610> ear<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.510> it's

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
we draw the club to the ear so it's

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.610 
we draw the club to the ear so it's
coming<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.290> here<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.630> at<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.750> same<00:04:46.780> time<00:04:47.320> the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
coming to here and at the same time the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.670 
coming to here and at the same time the
elbows<00:04:47.980> coming<00:04:48.250> forward<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.780> club<00:04:50.080> drops

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
elbows coming forward the club drops

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.750 
elbows coming forward the club drops
behind<00:04:50.980> my<00:04:51.280> back

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
behind my back

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.320 
behind my back
and<00:04:51.850> I'm<00:04:52.750> doing<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.980> outlet<00:04:54.460> position<00:04:55.030> again

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
and I'm doing the outlet position again

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.450 
and I'm doing the outlet position again
Simon<00:04:55.600> going<00:04:56.020> back<00:04:56.230> into<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.590> outlet<00:04:56.980> circle

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
Simon going back into the outlet circle

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.910 
Simon going back into the outlet circle
so<00:04:58.450> we'll<00:04:58.540> just<00:04:58.720> go<00:04:58.900> through<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:59.230> again<00:04:59.380> so

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
so we'll just go through that again so

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.150 
so we'll just go through that again so
it's<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:00.850> last<00:05:01.260> circle<00:05:02.260> of<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.590> sequence

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
it's the last circle of the sequence

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.040 
it's the last circle of the sequence
we've<00:05:03.370> done<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.790> outward<00:05:04.240> circle<00:05:04.720> change

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
we've done the outward circle change

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.260 
we've done the outward circle change
hands<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.620> now<00:05:05.980> we<00:05:06.040> do<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.430> inward<00:05:06.820> circle

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
hands and now we do the inward circle

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.820 
hands and now we do the inward circle
using<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.900> circle<00:05:08.320> here<00:05:10.290> pull<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.440> club<00:05:11.680> to

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
using with circle here pull the club to

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.880 
using with circle here pull the club to
the<00:05:11.860> ear<00:05:12.160> drop<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.670> behind<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.590> out<00:05:14.590> and

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
the ear drop it behind you out and

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:26.280 
the ear drop it behind you out and
circle<00:05:16.350> change<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:19.210> would<00:05:19.480> circle<00:05:25.020> if<00:05:26.020> we<00:05:26.140> go

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
circle change it would circle if we go

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.750 
circle change it would circle if we go
again<00:05:26.560> pull<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.880> club<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.450> eat<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.760> that

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
again pull the club to eat to you that

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.380 
again pull the club to eat to you that
would<00:05:31.000> circle<00:05:31.480> trench<00:05:31.870> it<00:05:32.470> was<00:05:32.770> circle<00:05:33.390> pull

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
would circle trench it was circle pull

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.350 
would circle trench it was circle pull
the<00:05:34.540> club<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.020> ear<00:05:35.850> outward<00:05:36.850> circle

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
the club to the ear outward circle

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:45.240 
the club to the ear outward circle
change<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.500> width<00:05:38.770> circle<00:05:41.520> okay<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:45.010> next

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
change in width circle okay the next

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.650 
change in width circle okay the next
thing<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.520> we're<00:05:45.790> still<00:05:46.060> going<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.210> add<00:05:46.419> to

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
thing that we're still going to add to

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.500 
thing that we're still going to add to
it<00:05:46.810> is<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.169> heart<00:05:47.470> shape<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:49.000> heart<00:05:49.210> shapes

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
it is the heart shape the heart shapes

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.630 
it is the heart shape the heart shapes
basically<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.530> harsh<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.919> known<00:05:51.190> as<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.430> heart

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
basically the harsh a known as the heart

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.020 
basically the harsh a known as the heart
shape<00:05:51.880> swing<00:05:52.210> actually<00:05:52.750> swing<00:05:53.020> outward<00:05:54.030> is

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
shape swing actually swing outward is

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.710 
shape swing actually swing outward is
basically<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:57.190> front<00:05:57.490> circle<00:05:58.090> followed<00:05:58.540> by

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
basically the front circle followed by

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.900 
basically the front circle followed by
small<00:05:59.020> back<00:05:59.229> circle<00:06:00.120> any<00:06:01.120> one<00:06:01.330> heart<00:06:01.570> shape

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
small back circle any one heart shape

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.190 
small back circle any one heart shape
will<00:06:03.910> need<00:06:04.060> given<00:06:04.360> with<00:06:04.479> heart<00:06:04.750> shape

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
will need given with heart shape

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.409 
will need given with heart shape
because<00:06:05.500> we're<00:06:05.680> changing<00:06:05.710> direction<00:06:06.419> after

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
because we're changing direction after

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.680 
because we're changing direction after
the<00:06:07.510> hand<00:06:07.750> change<00:06:08.970> so<00:06:09.970> we<00:06:10.060> just<00:06:10.210> do<00:06:10.390> that<00:06:10.510> on

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
the hand change so we just do that on

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.860 
the hand change so we just do that on
the<00:06:10.780> other<00:06:10.870> side<00:06:12.960> outward<00:06:13.960> heart<00:06:14.200> shape<00:06:17.820> order

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
the other side outward heart shape order

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.610 
the other side outward heart shape order
in<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.080> Parchin

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.250 

okay<00:06:25.880> stop<00:06:26.880> on<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.240> right<00:06:27.420> again<00:06:27.600> I<00:06:27.990> always

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
okay stop on the right again I always

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.100 
okay stop on the right again I always
like<00:06:28.500> to<00:06:28.530> start<00:06:28.860> from<00:06:29.070> the<00:06:29.220> right

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
like to start from the right

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.720 
like to start from the right
so<00:06:31.110> with<00:06:31.260> this<00:06:31.350> sequence<00:06:31.620> basically<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.490> always

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
so with this sequence basically I always

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
so with this sequence basically I always
start<00:06:33.030> with<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.590> outward<00:06:34.590> elbow<00:06:35.070> circle<00:06:35.750> so

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
start with the outward elbow circle so

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.360 
start with the outward elbow circle so
circle<00:06:37.580> change<00:06:38.870> in<00:06:39.870> would<00:06:40.170> circle<00:06:40.650> heart

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
circle change in would circle heart

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.640 
circle change in would circle heart
shape<00:06:41.670> inward<00:06:42.210> heart<00:06:42.360> check<00:06:42.830> reverse<00:06:45.650> outlook

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
shape inward heart check reverse outlook

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.050 
shape inward heart check reverse outlook
heart-shaped<00:06:47.450> Apple<00:06:48.450> to<00:06:49.370> change<00:06:50.370> in<00:06:50.850> would

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
heart-shaped Apple to change in would

00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:32.960 
heart-shaped Apple to change in would
circle<00:06:51.540> in<00:06:52.200> with<00:06:52.440> hardship<00:06:53.330> reverse

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.850 

that's<00:07:33.970> the<00:07:34.150> sequence<00:07:34.630> so<00:07:35.350> there<00:07:35.530> you<00:07:35.650> have<00:07:35.680> it

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
that's the sequence so there you have it

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.950 
that's the sequence so there you have it
that's<00:07:36.220> a<00:07:36.550> one<00:07:36.790> o'clock<00:07:37.030> compilation<00:07:37.780> with

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 
that's a one o'clock compilation with

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.590 
that's a one o'clock compilation with
hair<00:07:38.200> changes<00:07:38.880> something<00:07:39.880> future<00:07:40.360> practice

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.600 
hair changes something future practice

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.710 
hair changes something future practice
