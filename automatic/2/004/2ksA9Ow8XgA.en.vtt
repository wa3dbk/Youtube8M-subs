overview of the features that set this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.910 
overview of the features that set this
board<00:00:36.690> apart<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.200> let's<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.559> through<00:00:37.770> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
board apart so let's go through that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
board apart so let's go through that
really<00:00:38.100> quickly<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.700> you've<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.360> metal<00:00:39.570> ok

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
really quickly here you've got metal ok

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
really quickly here you've got metal ok
which<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.620> solution<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.399> allows<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
which is a solution that allows you to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
which is a solution that allows you to
press<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> button<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> board<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.290> in

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
press a button on the board and in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
press a button on the board and in
theory<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.670> should<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:45.210> able<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.539> post<00:00:45.870> with

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
theory it should be able to post with

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.690 
theory it should be able to post with
pretty<00:00:46.440> much<00:00:46.649> any<00:00:46.829> memory<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.550> allow

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
optimal settings and then get the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.150 
optimal settings and then get the
computer<00:00:51.390> running<00:00:51.629> you've<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.379> CPU<00:00:52.800> level<00:00:53.070> up

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
next let's get to the board itself so it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.230 
next let's get to the board itself so it
comes<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.430> its<00:03:00.700> nicely<00:03:00.910> little<00:03:01.470> windowed

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
then you've got your am-3 socket so this

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.950 
then you've got your am-3 socket so this

here<00:04:14.410> let's<00:04:14.620> have<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.830> look<00:04:14.950> at<00:04:15.070> these<00:04:15.160> onboard

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
here let's have a look at these onboard

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.159 
here let's have a look at these onboard
power<00:04:15.970> buttons<00:04:16.359> so<00:04:16.510> there's<00:04:16.660> your<00:04:16.780> start

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
power buttons so there's your start

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.759 
power buttons so there's your start
there's<00:04:17.620> your<00:04:17.830> reset<00:04:18.160> here

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
there's your reset here

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.009 
there's your reset here
mm<00:04:18.979> okay<00:04:19.310> button<00:04:19.639> and<00:04:19.819> then<00:04:20.209> clear<00:04:20.449> CMOS<00:04:20.810> is

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
mm okay button and then clear CMOS is

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.450 
mm okay button and then clear CMOS is
still<00:04:21.199> done<00:04:21.380> with<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.560> jumper<00:04:21.949> on<00:04:22.069> this<00:04:22.220> board

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
still done with a jumper on this board

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.800 
still done with a jumper on this board
so<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:22.699> don't<00:04:22.910> actually<00:04:23.060> have<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.419> button<00:04:23.660> for

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
so you don't actually have a button for

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.320 
so you don't actually have a button for
that<00:04:24.220> internally<00:04:25.220> but<00:04:25.400> more<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.759> that<00:04:25.910> later

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
that internally but more on that later

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.050 
that internally but more on that later
and<00:04:26.509> then<00:04:27.020> here<00:04:27.500> we've<00:04:27.680> got<00:04:27.919> four<00:04:28.400> SATA<00:04:28.669> ports

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
and then here we've got four SATA ports

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.360 
and then here we've got four SATA ports
that<00:04:29.720> are<00:04:29.870> right<00:04:30.080> angle<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.620> then<00:04:30.680> we<00:04:31.069> have

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
that are right angle and then we have

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.809 
that are right angle and then we have
one<00:04:31.759> additional<00:04:32.210> non<00:04:33.080> angled<00:04:33.590> SATA<00:04:34.009> port<00:04:34.400> now

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
one additional non angled SATA port now

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.370 
one additional non angled SATA port now
let's<00:04:35.030> have<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> quick<00:04:35.389> look<00:04:35.419> at<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.020> back

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
let's have a quick look at the back

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.990 
let's have a quick look at the back
panel<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.460> board<00:04:37.669> so<00:04:38.090> you've<00:04:38.240> got<00:04:39.400> six<00:04:40.400> USB

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
panel of the board so you've got six USB

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.180 
panel of the board so you've got six USB
ports<00:04:41.449> that's<00:04:41.630> very<00:04:41.840> few<00:04:42.199> on<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.470> board<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.009> this

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
ports that's very few on a board of this

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.640 
ports that's very few on a board of this
sort<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.630> price<00:04:44.630> point<00:04:44.960> but<00:04:45.199> I'm<00:04:45.380> guessing

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
sort of price point but I'm guessing

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.990 
sort of price point but I'm guessing
there's<00:04:45.949> some<00:04:46.130> kind<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.370> reason<00:04:46.699> for<00:04:46.910> it

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
there's some kind of reason for it

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.390 
there's some kind of reason for it
you've<00:04:47.360> got<00:04:47.569> one<00:04:47.780> ps2<00:04:48.289> keyboard<00:04:48.590> port<00:04:49.160> and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
you've got one ps2 keyboard port and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.309 
you've got one ps2 keyboard port and
then<00:04:49.759> you've<00:04:49.910> got<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.120> clear<00:04:50.509> CMOS<00:04:50.840> button<00:04:50.900> back

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
then you've got a clear CMOS button back

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.080 
then you've got a clear CMOS button back
here<00:04:51.620> honestly<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.310> my<00:04:52.340> favorite<00:04:52.909> place

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
here honestly this is my favorite place

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.089 
here honestly this is my favorite place
in<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.330> world<00:04:53.539> for<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.870> clear<00:04:54.110> CMOS<00:04:54.409> button<00:04:54.470> it

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
in the world for a clear CMOS button it

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.649 
in the world for a clear CMOS button it
can<00:04:55.340> come<00:04:55.550> in<00:04:55.699> handy<00:04:55.819> and<00:04:56.090> be<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.240> total

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
can come in handy and be a total

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.409 
can come in handy and be a total
lifesaver<00:04:57.050> then<00:04:57.620> you've<00:04:57.740> got<00:04:57.919> eSATA<00:04:58.460> firewire

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
lifesaver then you've got eSATA firewire

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.689 
lifesaver then you've got eSATA firewire
and<00:04:59.449> one<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.229> gigabit<00:05:00.560> ethernet<00:05:00.770> port<00:05:01.310> so
