00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.100 
inside the phone very carefully we've

created the new much smaller lightning
connector<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:32.100> all<00:02:32.340> digital<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.120> it's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.200 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:34.050> today's<00:02:34.200> uses<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.880> made<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.800 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.350> fits<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.010> way<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:39.630> also

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
reversible so it fits on the way we also

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.560
