Letran is a great trap by the nuture you
can<00:00:13.590> run<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.849> trapped<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.789> don't

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789

like<00:00:24.119> flying<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> make<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.090> it's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
like flying so how to make this it's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.089 
like flying so how to make this it's
actually<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.590> simple<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.410> want<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
actually really simple you just want to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.630 
actually really simple you just want to
set<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:33.200> like<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> wood<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
set up like the wood going like this and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
set up like the wood going like this and
then<00:00:36.450> make<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> square<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
then make it in like a square kind of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
then make it in like a square kind of
like<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.910> make<00:00:39.090> six<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.510> them<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:43.219> looks

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
like that you make six of them so looks

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.920 
like that you make six of them so looks
like<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.120> bit<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> really

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
like this a little bit it's a really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.950 
like this a little bit it's a really
easy<00:00:48.960> trap<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.129> effective<00:00:50.960> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
easy trap and it's pretty effective so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.950 
easy trap and it's pretty effective so
it's<00:00:52.410> probably<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.510> top<00:00:54.510> ten<00:00:54.719> shots

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it's probably one of the top ten shots

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.220 
it's probably one of the top ten shots
from<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> niche<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
from the niche and then you just want to

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
from the niche and then you just want to
get<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.410> sticky<00:00:58.770> pistons<00:00:59.300> some<00:01:00.300> redstone

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
get some sticky pistons some redstone

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
get some sticky pistons some redstone
pressure<00:01:01.410> plates<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:03.780> probably<00:01:04.409> all

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
pressure plates and that's probably all

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.460 
pressure plates and that's probably all
you're<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.920> need<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:07.049> center

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you're gonna need so in your center

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.219 
you're gonna need so in your center
square<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.990> I'm<00:01:09.990> gonna<00:01:10.140> make

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.120 
square which is this one I'm gonna make
it<00:01:12.080> call<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.110> Sun<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> guys<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it call the Sun so you guys can see it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.630 
it call the Sun so you guys can see it
better<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.900> sticky<00:01:16.229> pistons

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
better you just put two sticky pistons

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
better you just put two sticky pistons
two<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.650> like<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:24.710> then<00:01:25.710> put

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
two out from it like so and then put

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.380 
two out from it like so and then put
some<00:01:26.159> wooden<00:01:26.430> blocks<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.939> them<00:01:29.119> make<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.270> look

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
some wooden blocks on them make it look

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
some wooden blocks on them make it look
natural<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> come<00:01:32.159> behind

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
natural so you just want to come behind

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
natural so you just want to come behind
the<00:01:32.759> piston<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.650> dig<00:01:35.009> three<00:01:35.430> deep<00:01:36.079> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the piston and and dig three deep you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.800 
the piston and and dig three deep you
can<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.380> underneath<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.009> whole<00:01:38.130> trap<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.550 

sand<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.020> gonna<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> pain<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
then once you get to the end of the trap

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.880 
then once you get to the end of the trap
come<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.130> okay<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.680> want<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
come on okay right here you just want to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
come on okay right here you just want to
lay<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> redstone<00:01:56.490> down<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> way<00:01:57.299> but

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
lay the redstone down all the way but

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.679 
lay the redstone down all the way but
first<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> make<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> there's<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
first you want to make it so there's a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.670 
first you want to make it so there's a
layer<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.350> here

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
layer down right here

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.319 
layer down right here
you<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.280> want<00:02:02.490> three<00:02:02.700> deep<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> can

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you just want three deep so you can

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
you just want three deep so you can
actually<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.060> move<00:02:06.060> around<00:02:07.069> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
actually get in here and move around and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070 
actually get in here and move around and
then<00:02:08.310> yeah<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> lay<00:02:09.599> redstone

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
then yeah you just want to lay redstone

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.640 
then yeah you just want to lay redstone
completely

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
completely

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.559 
completely
so<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.099> goes<00:02:12.280> underneath<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.030> pressure<00:02:13.269> plate

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
so it goes underneath the pressure plate

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:21.179 
so it goes underneath the pressure plate
that's<00:02:13.930> gonna<00:02:14.739> be<00:02:14.920> triggering<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.459> trap<00:02:20.189> so

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
that's gonna be triggering the trap so

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.979 
that's gonna be triggering the trap so
yeah<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.150> then<00:02:22.390> when<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.599> get<00:02:22.720> this

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
yeah it's and then when you get this

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.410 
yeah it's and then when you get this
redstone<00:02:23.349> right<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:23.829> I<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.939> want<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.239> bring

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
redstone right here I just want to bring

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.080 
redstone right here I just want to bring
it<00:02:25.510> across<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.200> then<00:02:27.099> go<00:02:29.489> straight<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.849> way

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
it across and then go straight this way

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.440 
it across and then go straight this way
and<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.599> block<00:02:32.489> or<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.640> block<00:02:34.060> right<00:02:34.269> there

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
and then a block or a block right there

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.809 
and then a block or a block right there
so<00:02:34.659> you<00:02:34.750> can<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.530> when<00:02:36.370> your<00:02:36.489> red<00:02:36.640> some

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
so you can get so when your red some

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.270 
so you can get so when your red some
powers<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.239> walk<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:38.230> will<00:02:38.439> power<00:02:38.590> both

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
powers just walk it will power both

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640 
powers just walk it will power both
Pistons<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:40.269> here<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.569> then<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.470> bring

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
Pistons right here and then just bring

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.809 
Pistons right here and then just bring
this<00:02:41.859> side<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.189> do<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.310> same<00:02:42.549> thing<00:02:42.790> right

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
this side and do the same thing right

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.089 
this side and do the same thing right
here

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
here

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.080 
here
so<00:02:45.099> they<00:02:45.250> power<00:02:45.519> simultaneously<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:48.090> then

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
so they power simultaneously and then

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.280 
so they power simultaneously and then
you<00:02:49.239> just<00:02:49.420> want<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.569> do<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:49.750> same<00:02:49.959> thing<00:02:50.170> on

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
you just want to do the same thing on

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.339 
you just want to do the same thing on
the<00:02:50.440> other<00:02:50.470> side<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.629> just<00:02:52.900> want<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.170> come

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
the other side so you just want to come

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:01.490 
the other side so you just want to come
over<00:02:53.500> here<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:57.989> put<00:02:58.989> your<00:02:59.019> redstone<00:02:59.379> down

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
over here and put your redstone down

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.979 
over here and put your redstone down
bring<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.530> over<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:08.760> your<00:03:09.760> trap<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.389> pretty

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
bring it over and your trap is pretty

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.110 
bring it over and your trap is pretty
much<00:03:11.170> done<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.280> then<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.609> test<00:03:12.939> see

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
much done so then just test see

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.780 
much done so then just test see
professionally<00:03:13.870> done<00:03:14.280> obviously<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.430> change

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
professionally done obviously you change

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.640 
professionally done obviously you change
that<00:03:16.000> back<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.180> wood<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.750> bottom<00:03:17.139> block<00:03:17.349> so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
that back to wood that bottom block so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.839 
that back to wood that bottom block so
it's<00:03:17.769> not<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:19.239> different<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.959> then<00:03:20.669> we<00:03:21.669> just

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
it's not like different and then we just

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.909 
it's not like different and then we just
test<00:03:22.120> by<00:03:22.359> running<00:03:22.629> through<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.650> just

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
test by running through it and you just

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.189 
test by running through it and you just
always<00:03:24.459> get<00:03:24.790> trapped<00:03:25.090> unless<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.720> then

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
always get trapped unless and then

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.599 
always get trapped unless and then
you're<00:03:26.290> gonna<00:03:26.410> put<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> short<00:03:26.919> roof<00:03:27.069> over<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.430> so

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
you're gonna put a short roof over it so

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.550 
you're gonna put a short roof over it so
no<00:03:27.730> one<00:03:27.849> can<00:03:27.970> jump<00:03:28.239> over<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.409> make

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
no one can jump over it and then to make

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.610 
no one can jump over it and then to make
it<00:03:29.680> look<00:03:29.859> less<00:03:30.129> like<00:03:31.199> conspicuous<00:03:32.199> you<00:03:32.409> put

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
it look less like conspicuous you put

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.879 
it look less like conspicuous you put
pressure<00:03:32.919> plates<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.400> all<00:03:33.609> along<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.030> trap

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
pressure plates like all along the trap

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.379 
pressure plates like all along the trap
and<00:03:36.359> then<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.629> just<00:03:37.780> cover<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.109> up<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.430> here's

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
and then you just cover it up so here's

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.420 
and then you just cover it up so here's
some<00:03:40.599> examples<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.949> it<00:03:42.040> looks<00:03:42.159> like<00:03:42.280> when

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
some examples of what it looks like when

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.619 
some examples of what it looks like when
someone<00:03:42.729> runs<00:03:42.909> through<00:03:43.299> it

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
someone runs through it

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.960 
someone runs through it
okay<00:03:44.229> so<00:03:44.290> we<00:03:44.500> got<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.829> prefer<00:03:45.159> a<00:03:45.190> bottom<00:03:45.519> here<00:03:45.669> he

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
okay so we got I prefer a bottom here he

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.509 
okay so we got I prefer a bottom here he
runs<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.109> trap<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.949> second<00:03:48.280> he<00:03:48.340> steps

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
runs to the trap and the second he steps

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.449 
runs to the trap and the second he steps
on<00:03:48.669> the<00:03:48.699> pressure<00:03:48.970> plate<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:50.190> redstone<00:03:51.190> turns

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
on the pressure plate the redstone turns

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.509 
on the pressure plate the redstone turns
on<00:03:51.639> on<00:03:51.669> both<00:03:51.970> sides<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.979> then<00:03:53.979> the<00:03:54.010> only<00:03:54.340> way

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
on on both sides and then the only way

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.399 
on on both sides and then the only way
to<00:03:54.579> get<00:03:54.760> him<00:03:54.849> out<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.569> break<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.199> top

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
to get him out is to just break the top

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.589 
to get him out is to just break the top
block<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:56.949> can<00:03:57.099> get<00:03:57.220> out<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.699> then<00:03:58.419> it's

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
block so you can get out and then it's

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.719 
block so you can get out and then it's
good<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.810> go<00:03:58.900> again<00:03:59.260> okay<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:00.250> here's<00:04:00.549> another

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
good to go again okay so here's another

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.240 
good to go again okay so here's another
shot<00:04:01.030> from<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> inside<00:04:01.739> second<00:04:02.739> he<00:04:02.799> steps<00:04:03.069> on

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
shot from the inside second he steps on

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.759 
shot from the inside second he steps on
it<00:04:03.430> they<00:04:03.579> instantly<00:04:04.030> block<00:04:04.780> him<00:04:04.989> in<00:04:05.139> and<00:04:05.440> then

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
it they instantly block him in and then

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.889 
it they instantly block him in and then
the<00:04:06.459> Pistons<00:04:06.909> stay<00:04:07.419> put<00:04:07.690> until<00:04:07.930> he
