00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
stuff that if you go to get it you're

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.580 
stuff that if you go to get it you're
going<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.850> die<00:06:14.060> either<00:06:14.330> way<00:06:14.450> they<00:06:15.380> could<00:06:15.560> have

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
going to die either way they could have

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.810 
going to die either way they could have
worked<00:06:15.830> better<00:06:16.070> on<00:06:16.190> a<00:06:16.280> couple<00:06:16.669> of<00:06:16.729> those

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
worked better on a couple of those

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.380 
worked better on a couple of those
points<00:06:17.530> because<00:06:18.530> it<00:06:18.680> starting<00:06:19.520> somewhat

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
points because it starting somewhat

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.880 
points because it starting somewhat
effective<00:06:20.840> especially<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.470> health<00:06:21.650> of<00:06:21.710> all

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
effective especially the health of all

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.060 
effective especially the health of all
races<00:06:22.100> if<00:06:22.760> you

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
races if you

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.400 
races if you
not<00:06:23.910> knowing<00:06:24.210> you're<00:06:24.330> going<00:06:24.510> into<00:06:24.750> one<00:06:24.900> you

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
not knowing you're going into one you

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.330 
not knowing you're going into one you
can't<00:06:25.650> exit<00:06:26.070> out<00:06:26.220> so<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:26.520> basically<00:06:26.700> screwed

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
can't exit out so you basically screwed

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.910 
can't exit out so you basically screwed
but<00:06:29.340> like<00:06:29.520> I<00:06:29.670> said<00:06:29.780> that's<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.990> downside<00:06:31.200> it's

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
but like I said that's the downside it's

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.110 
but like I said that's the downside it's
a<00:06:32.310> cliffhanger<00:06:32.880> ending<00:06:34.700> overall<00:06:35.700> there<00:06:35.940> was<00:06:36.090> a

a cliffhanger ending overall there was a

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.140 
a cliffhanger ending overall there was a
good<00:06:36.480> game<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:37.740> clock<00:06:38.070> called<00:06:38.460> collecting<00:06:39.030> at

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
good game the clock called collecting at

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.400 
good game the clock called collecting at
the<00:06:39.240> feather<00:06:39.420> collecting<00:06:39.810> can't<00:06:40.080> get<00:06:40.230> a

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
the feather collecting can't get a

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.280 
the feather collecting can't get a
little<00:06:40.980> boy<00:06:41.460> but<00:06:42.390> it<00:06:42.510> doesn't<00:06:42.660> happen<00:06:42.900> that
