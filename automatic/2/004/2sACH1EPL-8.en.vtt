00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 In this video I explain you as you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.830
 Cotton shirts right and best 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.230
 if you can 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.940
 Cotton shirts were you should then 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.889
 Be sure he is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 This button before you in the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.850
 washing machine does not shake so much 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.220
 that means making all the buttons in front 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.930
 and fold the questions inside 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 In addition, you should the cotton shirts 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.029
 no hotter than 40-60 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.610
 degree wash if they are not strong 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.559
 have pollution or visual 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.360
 stains then it is enough even if you her 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.329
 at 30 degrees washes you hands up 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.250
 no case in dry 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.649
 because that's how the cotton hands run 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.440
 one is best put on one 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.620
 clotheslines and you do not know them 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.309
 with clothespins on it or put over 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 but it depends on one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.070
 then hang it wide and leave it that way 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.719
 dry that when now on the strip 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.299
 hang with your hands 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.340
 nice and smooth with that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.840
 slashed begins to dry 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.590
 you can do it in the end much better 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.479
 and iron easier and think naturally 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.850
 tuned 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.659
 the collar shape will dry again 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 to fold outside 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:28.020
 You should also iron on it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.250
 then pay attention if it is then dried 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.810
 that you want to build the iron 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 temperature is there, there are mostly 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.479
 an extra attitude and then up 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310
 no case the iron on long 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 a place keep the shirt very much 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 can strain and then you have to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.649
 the button game well watch that you 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 but very close to the buttons 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.280
 not about it 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.990
 so then there's still oh so to speak 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.340
 best used no sling in 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 the washing machine that you can 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.610
 exhibit or just a premature 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.410
 program 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.420
 that strained that has it again 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.500
 unnecessary and it just is not 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 necessary and if you stain up 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
 should have your shirt 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.490
 there you can either before before 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.070
 Just wash a little detergent 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.590
 it do the work a bit and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.880
 then you can give a washing machine 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.860
 but also just normal 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.420
 stain removers use that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.770
 actually works quite well 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.050
 good and I think you should use yours 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.590
 Cotton shirts get well groomed with 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.590
 these tips
