00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
started the lp like over a year ago so I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.060 
started the lp like over a year ago so I
feel<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.009> stupid<00:01:44.520> about<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:46.070> where

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
feel really stupid about that but where

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
feel really stupid about that but where
it<00:01:47.159> stands<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:49.079> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it stands right now is I'm kind of at a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.160 
it stands right now is I'm kind of at a
crossroads<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.399> know<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> do

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
crossroads and I don't know what to do

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.460 
crossroads and I don't know what to do
so<00:01:52.170> here's<00:01:52.439> pretty<00:01:52.649> much<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:54.030> problem<00:01:54.509> i

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
so here's pretty much my my problem i

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.249 
so here's pretty much my my problem i
have<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> safe<00:01:56.579> state<00:01:56.909> available<00:01:57.259> that's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
have a safe state available that's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.600 
have a safe state available that's
pretty<00:01:58.590> much<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.979> where<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> left<00:01:59.250> off

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pretty much right where I left off

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.749 
pretty much right where I left off
however<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.469> new<00:02:01.649> game<00:02:01.860> plus<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
however it's a new game plus what that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.440 
however it's a new game plus what that
means<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.299> i<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.049> bunch<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.250> hidden<00:02:06.149> stuff

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
means is i have a bunch of hidden stuff

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.240 
means is i have a bunch of hidden stuff
i<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> bunch<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.950> items<00:02:08.369> i<00:02:08.670> didn't<00:02:08.849> have

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
i have a bunch of items i didn't have

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.400 
i have a bunch of items i didn't have
for<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.789> have<00:02:10.149> levels<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.869> didn't<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.230> before

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
for I have levels I didn't have before

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
for I have levels I didn't have before
because<00:02:11.830> when<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.250> start<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.760> new<00:02:12.970> game<00:02:13.000> plus

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
because when you start a new game plus

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.230 
because when you start a new game plus
you<00:02:14.140> keep<00:02:14.290> all<00:02:14.440> your<00:02:14.500> stats<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:16.060> don't

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
you keep all your stats you don't

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.790 
you keep all your stats you don't
necessarily<00:02:16.360> keep<00:02:16.840> elements<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.620> keep

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
necessarily keep elements but you keep

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.880 
necessarily keep elements but you keep
stats<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.460> they're<00:02:18.700> basically<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:19.120> level<00:02:19.450> 99

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
stats so they're basically a level 99

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.760 
stats so they're basically a level 99
which<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.010> kind<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.370> crapshoot<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:23.020> have

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
which is kind of a crapshoot I have

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.260 
which is kind of a crapshoot I have
secret<00:02:24.310> items<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.730> you're<00:02:24.790> not<00:02:24.910> supposed<00:02:25.060> to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
secret items that you're not supposed to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.870 
secret items that you're not supposed to
have<00:02:25.510> yet<00:02:25.810> um<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.680> don't<00:02:27.100> have<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.700> same

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
have yet um I don't have the same

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.110 
have yet um I don't have the same
characters<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.660> before<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.550> would<00:02:30.820> be

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
characters as before so it would be

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.020 
characters as before so it would be
basically<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.830> know<00:02:32.950> picking<00:02:33.550> off<00:02:33.730> where<00:02:33.970> I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
basically you know picking off where I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.050 
basically you know picking off where I
left<00:02:34.150> off<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:35.250> except<00:02:36.250> i<00:02:36.550> can't<00:02:36.580> do<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
left off like except i can't do the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.400 
left off like except i can't do the
Dario<00:02:37.360> side<00:02:37.570> quest<00:02:37.840> because<00:02:38.020> it's<00:02:38.200> already

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
Dario side quest because it's already

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.440 
Dario side quest because it's already
finished<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.220> safe<00:02:39.820> state<00:02:40.090> which<00:02:40.330> I'm

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
finished in that safe state which I'm

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.780 
finished in that safe state which I'm
really<00:02:40.630> bummed<00:02:40.959> about<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.250> basically<00:02:42.580> it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
really bummed about so basically it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.190 
really bummed about so basically it
would<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.000> me<00:02:43.180> taking<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> earth<00:02:43.810> dragon

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
would be me taking on the earth dragon

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.530

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
have that safe state that I could easily

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.050 
have that safe state that I could easily
pick<00:03:01.750> up<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.050> now<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.220> will<00:03:03.370> be<00:03:03.700> really

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
pick up on now but it will be really

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.930 
pick up on now but it will be really
different<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.290> that's<00:03:05.440> one<00:03:05.709> option<00:03:06.040> option

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
different so that's one option option

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.449 
different so that's one option option
number<00:03:06.970> two<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.930> obviously<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.130> play<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
number two is obviously to just play the

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.210 
number two is obviously to just play the
game<00:03:09.489> over<00:03:09.970> with<00:03:10.510> my<00:03:10.780> time<00:03:11.170> frame<00:03:11.560> right<00:03:11.770> now<00:03:11.950> I

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
game over with my time frame right now I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.280 
game over with my time frame right now I
just<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:13.390> not<00:03:13.540> looking<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.080> it's<00:03:14.200> gonna

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
just it's not looking like it's gonna

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.250 
just it's not looking like it's gonna
happen<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.209> honest<00:03:16.540> with<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.870> tried

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
happen and to be honest with you I tried

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.750 
happen and to be honest with you I tried
to<00:03:17.470> play<00:03:17.590> through<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.160> whole<00:03:18.370> time<00:03:18.549> I've

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
to play through this whole time I've

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.729 
to play through this whole time I've
been<00:03:18.790> trying<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.330> I<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.630> lost<00:03:19.930> my<00:03:20.140> taste<00:03:20.560> for

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
been trying and I just lost my taste for

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.949 
been trying and I just lost my taste for
it<00:03:20.890> because<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.580> Chrono<00:03:22.510> Cross<00:03:22.600> is

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
it because you know Chrono Cross is

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.860 
it because you know Chrono Cross is
really<00:03:23.380> heavily<00:03:24.130> dialogued<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.450> even

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
really heavily dialogued and even

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.890 
really heavily dialogued and even
speeding<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.530> up<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.890> was<00:03:27.459> just<00:03:27.640> taking<00:03:28.090> 4ever

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
speeding it up it was just taking 4ever

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.430 
speeding it up it was just taking 4ever
and<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:30.610> know<00:03:30.880> when<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:32.019> play<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> game

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and you know when you just play a game

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.570 
and you know when you just play a game
and<00:03:32.560> then<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.769> suddenly<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.459> play

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580
