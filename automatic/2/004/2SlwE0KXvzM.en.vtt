00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
more spring into that jigging wrap which

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
more spring into that jigging wrap which
makes<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.920> flash<00:01:11.250> makes<00:01:11.670> it

whereas this poll the 28 inch medium

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
whereas this poll the 28 inch medium
will<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.740> flexible

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
will be a little more flexible

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.359 
will be a little more flexible
throughout<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> whole<00:01:18.119> body<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> rod

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
throughout the whole body of the rod

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.789 
throughout the whole body of the rod
which<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.880> allows<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> call

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
which really allows me to do what I call

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
which really allows me to do what I call
the<00:01:23.070> pancake<00:01:23.580> flop<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> that's<00:01:24.270> basically

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the pancake flop and that's basically

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200 
the pancake flop and that's basically
what<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.409> rip<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.430> high<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
what I just rip it up as high as I can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.469 
what I just rip it up as high as I can
and<00:01:27.450> let<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> fall<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and let it fall and then when I do that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.780 
and let it fall and then when I do that
little<00:01:30.720> twitch<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.680> gives<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.369> subtle

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
little twitch it gives it a more subtle

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.289 
little twitch it gives it a more subtle
up<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.540> rather<00:01:33.810> than<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.110> quick<00:01:34.409> snap<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
up and down rather than a quick snap and

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
up and down rather than a quick snap and
some<00:01:36.299> days<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> difference

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
some days that can be the difference

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.910 
some days that can be the difference
between<00:01:38.100> catching<00:01:38.759> fish<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.590> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
between catching fish and not so I like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.300 
between catching fish and not so I like
to<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.189> these<00:01:42.060> polls<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> ready<00:01:43.280> now<00:01:44.280> a

barrel swivel on to my main line which

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.039 
barrel swivel on to my main line which
is<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:56.969> connected<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:57.869> 18<00:01:58.380> inches<00:01:58.590> of

whatever<00:02:16.319> bait<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.130> those<00:02:17.970> big<00:02:18.270> baits<00:02:18.569> will

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
whatever bait it is those big baits will

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.500 
whatever bait it is those big baits will
twist<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.560> line<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.970> barrel<00:02:21.420> swivel

twist up your line and a barrel swivel

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.570 
twist up your line and a barrel swivel
will<00:02:22.050> help<00:02:22.290> tremendously<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.610> so

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
will help tremendously with that so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
will help tremendously with that so
definitely<00:02:27.410> definitely<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.680> good<00:02:28.920> idea<00:02:29.600> then

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
definitely definitely a good idea then

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.430 
definitely definitely a good idea then
the<00:02:31.200> fast<00:02:31.500> snap<00:02:31.800> at<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> end<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.260> use

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the fast snap at the end I like to use

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.570 
the fast snap at the end I like to use
because<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:35.550> has<00:02:36.239> an<00:02:36.630> open<00:02:37.019> loop<00:02:37.440> which<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.310> feel

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
because it has an open loop which I feel

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.600 
because it has an open loop which I feel
gives<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.030> more<00:02:39.180> action<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:40.200> people

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
gives it more action some people

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.470 
gives it more action some people
disagree<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.890> like<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.130> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
disagree with that but I like it and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.960 
disagree with that but I like it and
also<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.830> called<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.160> fast<00:02:47.400> snap<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
also it's called a fast snap for a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.509 
also it's called a fast snap for a
reason<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:49.170> take<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> bait<00:02:49.680> off<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.190> about

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
reason I can take a bait off in about

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.580 
reason I can take a bait off in about
two<00:02:50.910> seconds<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.569> have<00:02:51.750> another<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.350> in

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
two seconds and have another one on in

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.830 
two seconds and have another one on in
five<00:02:52.850> which<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.299> huge

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
five which can be huge

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.900 
five which can be huge
if<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.890> school<00:02:56.220> while<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> coming

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
if I have a school while I coming

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.330 
if I have a school while I coming
through<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:58.260> will<00:02:58.410> not<00:02:58.590> hit<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> certain

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
through and they will not hit a certain

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.100 
through and they will not hit a certain
color<00:02:59.519> bay<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.819> believe<00:03:03.600> it's<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.810> huge

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
color bay so I believe it's a huge

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.770 
color bay so I believe it's a huge
advantage<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.739> use<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> snap<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.510> we're

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
advantage to use a snap now that we're

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.479 
advantage to use a snap now that we're
