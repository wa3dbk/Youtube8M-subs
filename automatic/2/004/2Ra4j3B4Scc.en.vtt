00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.240 

for<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> TV<00:00:02.629> the<00:00:03.629> world<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.319> thinking<00:00:06.649> so<00:00:07.649> let's

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
for a TV the world is thinking so let's

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.320 
for a TV the world is thinking so let's
talk<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.730> moon<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.000> where<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.210> came

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
talk about the moon and where it came

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.419 
talk about the moon and where it came
from<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.660> didn't<00:00:09.809> always<00:00:09.990> exist<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.370> did

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
from it didn't always exist so how did

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.190 
from it didn't always exist so how did
we<00:00:11.700> actually<00:00:11.820> get<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:12.900> are<00:00:13.080> just

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
we actually get it and so these are just

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.629 
we actually get it and so these are just
some<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> questions<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.280> touch<00:00:14.429> on

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
some of the questions I want to touch on

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
some of the questions I want to touch on
just<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.969> give<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> little<00:00:15.540> flavor<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.020> what

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
just to give you a little flavor of what

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.779 
just to give you a little flavor of what
we<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> moon<00:00:16.740> why<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.369> even<00:00:17.490> have

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
we know about the moon why we even have

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.269 
we know about the moon why we even have
a<00:00:17.820> moon<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.480> place<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> Creator<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
a moon in the first place the Creator in

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.070 
a moon in the first place the Creator in
history<00:00:20.580> how<00:00:20.760> did<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.150> come<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.480> how<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
history how did it come to be how it is

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.179 
history how did it come to be how it is
right<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.380> why<00:00:22.560> does<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> look<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> way<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
right now why does it look the way it

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.370 
right now why does it look the way it
does<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:24.600> moon<00:00:24.840> has<00:00:25.019> very<00:00:25.230> low<00:00:25.350> density

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
does the moon has very low density

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
does the moon has very low density
compared<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> earth<00:00:26.640> why<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.300> we

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
compared to the earth why is that we

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.019 
compared to the earth why is that we
have<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.900> able<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> explain<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> away<00:00:29.029> why

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
have to be able to explain that away why

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.580 
have to be able to explain that away why
does<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> moon<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.779> little<00:00:30.960> metal<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
does the moon have so little metal that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
does the moon have so little metal that
ties<00:00:31.890> into<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> density<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.270> moon<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
ties into the density and the moon is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.270 
ties into the density and the moon is
actually<00:00:33.660> once<00:00:34.050> closer<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> earth<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
actually once closer to the earth and it

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.299 
actually once closer to the earth and it
is<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:35.520> interesting<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.809> moving

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
is now interesting so it's it's moving

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
is now interesting so it's it's moving
okay<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.730> how<00:00:39.120> did<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.480> moon<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:39.840> form

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
okay so how did the moon actually form

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.819 
okay so how did the moon actually form
so<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.790> our<00:00:42.030> best<00:00:42.059> current<00:00:43.050> estimate<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so this is our best current estimate of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
so this is our best current estimate of
how<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.160> moon<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> our<00:00:45.000> solar<00:00:45.210> system

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
how the moon and our solar system

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
how the moon and our solar system
actually<00:00:45.870> formed<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> whole<00:00:47.250> solar

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
actually formed and so the whole solar

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
actually formed and so the whole solar
system<00:00:47.579> started<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.899> called

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
system started out with this is called

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
system started out with this is called
the<00:00:49.200> solar<00:00:49.469> nebula<00:00:49.800> theory<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.910> basically

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the solar nebula theory and so basically

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
the solar nebula theory and so basically
what<00:00:51.629> you've<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
what you've got in here you have this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.029 
what you've got in here you have this
big<00:00:53.579> cloud<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.940> gas<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.420> dust<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> cloud

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
big cloud of gas and dust so the cloud

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.369 
big cloud of gas and dust so the cloud
of<00:00:56.070> gas<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.399> dust<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> cosmos<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
of gas and dust is out in the cosmos and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
of gas and dust is out in the cosmos and
it<00:00:58.680> begins<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.039> contract<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> spin<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.020> top

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it begins to contract and spin in on top

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.750 
it begins to contract and spin in on top
of<00:01:01.230> itself<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> starts<00:01:02.309> being<00:01:02.430> pulled

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of itself so it starts being pulled

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.130 
of itself so it starts being pulled
towards<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> center<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:03.539> gravity<00:01:03.930> gravity

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
towards the center by gravity gravity

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
towards the center by gravity gravity
always<00:01:04.470> pulls<00:01:04.830> things<00:01:05.070> towards<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> center

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
always pulls things towards the center

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.420 
always pulls things towards the center
when<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.900> big<00:01:07.080> mass<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.920> things

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
when you have this big mass so things

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.130 
when you have this big mass so things
get<00:01:08.670> pulled<00:01:08.880> towards<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> center<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.930> mass

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
get pulled towards the center the mass

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.510 
get pulled towards the center the mass
that<00:01:10.350> gets<00:01:10.530> pulled<00:01:10.770> towards<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> center<00:01:11.400> in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
that gets pulled towards the center in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
that gets pulled towards the center in
the<00:01:11.580> middle<00:01:11.850> eventually<00:01:12.750> coalesce<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the middle eventually coalesce is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.899 
the middle eventually coalesce is
informs<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> protosun<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.670> eventually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
informs the protosun which eventually

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.670 
informs the protosun which eventually
becomes<00:01:15.270> our<00:01:15.509> son<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.170> you've<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.409> these

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
becomes our son so you've got all these

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
becomes our son so you've got all these
hot<00:01:16.830> gases<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.400> coming<00:01:17.670> together<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hot gases that are coming together and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.870 
hot gases that are coming together and
you<00:01:18.659> form<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.170> son<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> center<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.430> then

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you form a son in the center and then

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
you form a son in the center and then
around<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.509> you've<00:01:21.750> got<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:22.320> you've

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
around this you've got this now you've

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
around this you've got this now you've
got<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> disc<00:01:23.130> you've<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> mask<00:01:24.570> comes

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
got this disc you've got this mask comes

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
got this disc you've got this mask comes
in<00:01:25.080> together<00:01:25.310> flattens<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> disc<00:01:26.880> now

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in together flattens into a disc now

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
in together flattens into a disc now
you've<00:01:27.210> got<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.330> swirling<00:01:27.960> disk<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.350> rocks

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you've got the swirling disk of rocks

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.410 
you've got the swirling disk of rocks
and<00:01:28.950> dust<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.400> ice<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.820> sorts<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.150> junk

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and dust and ice and all sorts of junk

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510 
and dust and ice and all sorts of junk
and<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.200> basically<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> swirling<00:01:32.159> around

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and so basically it's swirling around

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
and so basically it's swirling around
the<00:01:32.939> Sun<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.110> swirling<00:01:34.320> around

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the Sun and as it's swirling around

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
the Sun and as it's swirling around
there<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:34.950> particles<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.640> pieces<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> rock

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there are particles and pieces of rock

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.969 
there are particles and pieces of rock
and<00:01:36.450> dust<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> ice<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.259> are<00:01:37.560> hitting<00:01:37.860> each

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and dust and ice that are hitting each

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.530 
and dust and ice that are hitting each
other<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.119> hit<00:01:39.270> each<00:01:39.329> other

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
other and as they hit each other

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.060 
other and as they hit each other
sometimes<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.200> hit<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> sometimes<00:01:40.890> they

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
sometimes they hit and sometimes they

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.889 
sometimes they hit and sometimes they
stick<00:01:41.369> when<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.060> stick<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.720> call<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
stick when they stick we call that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.719 
stick when they stick we call that
accretion<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.680> basically<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.159> these<00:01:44.490> pieces

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
accretion so basically all these pieces

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
accretion so basically all these pieces
come<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.240> stick<00:01:45.540> together<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
come and stick together and then you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
come and stick together and then you
build<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.070> planets<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:48.180> our

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
build up planets and that's how our

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.639 
build up planets and that's how our
solar<00:01:48.600> system<00:01:48.930> form<00:01:49.140> that's<00:01:49.259> our<00:01:49.409> best

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
solar system form that's our best

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.340 
solar system form that's our best
estimate<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.220> how<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> solar<00:01:50.610> system<00:01:51.000> formed

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
estimate for how the solar system formed

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
estimate for how the solar system formed
so<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.280> earth<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:53.909> through<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so as the earth is going through this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670 
so as the earth is going through this
process<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.899> we've<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> material

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
process so we've got all this material

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.459 
process so we've got all this material
in<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.280> disk<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:57.060> around<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> Sun<00:01:57.630> coming

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
in this disk going around the Sun coming

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.319 
in this disk going around the Sun coming
up<00:01:58.680> hitting<00:01:59.070> each<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.430> coalescing

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
up hitting each other coalescing

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
up hitting each other coalescing
together<00:02:00.979> there's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.040> lot<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> energy<00:02:02.430> in

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
together there's a lot of energy in

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
together there's a lot of energy in
those<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.299> those<00:02:03.360> impacts<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.079> they're

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
those in those impacts when they're

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.480 
those in those impacts when they're
hitting<00:02:04.409> each<00:02:04.530> other<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.100> there's<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> lot

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
hitting each other and so there's a lot

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.830 
hitting each other and so there's a lot
of<00:02:05.520> heat<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:05.939> generated<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.780> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
of heat that's generated and so you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.660 
of heat that's generated and so you
start<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> melt<00:02:07.439> things<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> rocks

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
start to melt things so the rocks

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
start to melt things so the rocks
themselves<00:02:08.940> start<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> melt<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.619> that's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
themselves start to melt and so that's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.130 
themselves start to melt and so that's
what's<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.970> you've<00:02:12.510> got<00:02:12.690> melting

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
what's going on here you've got melting

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.520 
what's going on here you've got melting
going

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
going

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
going
on<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:13.920> now<00:02:14.069> you've<00:02:14.220> got<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.640> molten<00:02:15.030> rock

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
on so now you've got like molten rock

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.750 
on so now you've got like molten rock
like<00:02:15.720> lavas<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.350> know<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.590> melted<00:02:16.950> when

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
like lavas you know like melted when

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.820 
like lavas you know like melted when
you've<00:02:17.910> got<00:02:18.090> melted<00:02:18.420> rock<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
you've got melted rock you can have the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.860 
you've got melted rock you can have the
more<00:02:20.069> dense<00:02:20.310> material<00:02:20.850> sink<00:02:21.270> down<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
more dense material sink down to the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.420 
more dense material sink down to the
middle<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.709> what<00:02:22.860> happened<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.310> our

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
middle and this is what happened on our

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.980 
middle and this is what happened on our
planet<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> process<00:02:24.930> of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
planet this is the process of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.480 
planet this is the process of
differentiation<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.160> want<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
differentiation if you want the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.809 
differentiation if you want the
technical<00:02:27.060> term<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.990> basically<00:02:28.530> as<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.580> solar

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
technical term so basically as the solar

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.640 
technical term so basically as the solar
systems<00:02:30.180> are<00:02:30.300> creating<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.810> forming<00:02:30.840> you've

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
systems are creating and forming you've

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.670 
systems are creating and forming you've
got<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.010> melted<00:02:32.520> planet<00:02:33.060> all<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.290> more

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
got this melted planet all of the more

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
got this melted planet all of the more
dense<00:02:34.950> materials<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.209> here

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
dense materials so as you can see here

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420 
dense materials so as you can see here
all<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> metals<00:02:36.959> basically<00:02:37.590> are<00:02:37.800> sinking

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
all the metals basically are sinking

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.070 
all the metals basically are sinking
down<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.880> middle<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.360> into<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> core

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
down to the middle there into the core

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.780 
down to the middle there into the core
that's<00:02:40.380> why<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> metallic<00:02:41.310> core<00:02:41.520> cause

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
that's why we have a metallic core cause

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.699 
that's why we have a metallic core cause
it<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.060> condensed<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.200> sunk<00:02:43.500> down

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it all condensed and then sunk down

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.190 
it all condensed and then sunk down
early<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.880> lighter<00:02:45.120> stuff<00:02:45.270> floats<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
early on the lighter stuff floats to the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.110 
early on the lighter stuff floats to the
top<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.980> why<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> rocks<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.880> surface

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
top that's why the rocks on the surface

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.430 
top that's why the rocks on the surface
of<00:02:48.209> our<00:02:48.300> planet<00:02:48.360> are<00:02:48.780> relatively<00:02:49.170> light

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
of our planet are relatively light

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.900 
of our planet are relatively light
compared<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> metals<00:02:50.190> silicates<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
compared to metals silicates and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000 
compared to metals silicates and
granites<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.630> sort<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> thing<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.590> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
granites and that sort of thing and so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.670 
granites and that sort of thing and so
this<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.580> general<00:02:54.260> process<00:02:55.260> that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
this is just the general process that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.380 
this is just the general process that
happens<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:56.100> basically<00:02:56.670> all<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.030> planets

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
happens on basically all the planets

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.150 
happens on basically all the planets
that<00:02:57.510> are<00:02:57.600> forming<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> important<00:02:59.040> thing

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
that are forming so the important thing

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.340 
that are forming so the important thing
though<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.489> all<00:02:59.730> those<00:02:59.850> metals<00:03:00.269> many<00:03:01.200> of

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
though is that all those metals many of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.020 
though is that all those metals many of
them<00:03:01.470> are<00:03:01.590> getting<00:03:01.860> stuck<00:03:02.310> down<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.819> core

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
them are getting stuck down in the core

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.870 
them are getting stuck down in the core
all<00:03:03.720> right<00:03:03.920> well<00:03:04.920> how<00:03:05.190> does<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.550> play<00:03:05.760> into

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
all right well how does this play into

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.300 
all right well how does this play into
the<00:03:06.180> moon<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:07.050> when<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> earth<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.650> forming

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the moon so when the earth was forming

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.710 
the moon so when the earth was forming
when<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.580> earth<00:03:08.670> was<00:03:08.700> very<00:03:09.090> young<00:03:09.300> baby

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
when the earth was very young baby

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.440 
when the earth was very young baby
little<00:03:10.050> earth<00:03:10.200> there<00:03:10.980> was<00:03:11.160> no<00:03:11.340> moon<00:03:11.550> remember

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
little earth there was no moon remember

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.970 
little earth there was no moon remember
I<00:03:12.480> told<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.260> solar<00:03:13.470> nebula<00:03:13.830> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
I told you in this solar nebula a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770 
I told you in this solar nebula a
material<00:03:14.580> that's<00:03:14.610> swirling<00:03:15.060> around<00:03:15.330> hitting

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
material that's swirling around hitting

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.210 
material that's swirling around hitting
each<00:03:15.989> other<00:03:16.140> well<00:03:16.650> what<00:03:16.800> happened<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.190> our

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
each other well what happened to our

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.460 
each other well what happened to our
earth<00:03:17.489> very<00:03:17.910> early<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.720> got<00:03:18.870> hit<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.350> got

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
earth very early on is it got hit it got

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.740 
earth very early on is it got hit it got
whacked<00:03:19.769> pretty<00:03:20.130> hard<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.940> got<00:03:21.060> hit<00:03:21.299> by<00:03:21.720> a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
whacked pretty hard and it got hit by a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.509 
whacked pretty hard and it got hit by a
rock<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.230> was<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.860> order<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> size<00:03:23.370> of

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
rock that was on the order the size of

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.250 
rock that was on the order the size of
Mars<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.180> almost<00:03:24.299> destroyed<00:03:24.540> our<00:03:24.930> planet

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
Mars so it almost destroyed our planet

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.440 
Mars so it almost destroyed our planet
this<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> huge<00:03:25.860> impact<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> did<00:03:27.269> when

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
this is a huge impact what it did when

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.780 
this is a huge impact what it did when
it<00:03:27.510> hits<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.230> ripped<00:03:28.560> off<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.100> top<00:03:29.310> part<00:03:29.610> of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
it hits is it ripped off the top part of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.190 
it hits is it ripped off the top part of
our<00:03:29.970> planet<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.450> was<00:03:30.570> already<00:03:30.810> undergoing

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
our planet that was already undergoing

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.350 
our planet that was already undergoing
this<00:03:31.410> differentiation<00:03:31.769> process<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.180> it's

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
this differentiation process so it's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.479 
this differentiation process so it's
ripping<00:03:33.690> off<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.260> top<00:03:34.500> layer<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.769> rocks<00:03:35.220> and

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
ripping off that top layer of rocks and

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.190 
ripping off that top layer of rocks and
so<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.120> material<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.660> was<00:03:36.720> ripped<00:03:37.019> off

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
so that material that was ripped off

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.620 
so that material that was ripped off
then<00:03:37.799> gravitationally<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.910> bound<00:03:39.180> around<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
then gravitationally is bound around the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.560 
then gravitationally is bound around the
earth<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.560> forms<00:03:40.890> its<00:03:41.190> own<00:03:41.430> little<00:03:41.730> disk<00:03:42.239> of

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
earth so it forms its own little disk of

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.810 
earth so it forms its own little disk of
material<00:03:42.890> space<00:03:43.890> junk<00:03:44.250> that's<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.730> around

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
material space junk that's going around

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.660 
material space junk that's going around
in<00:03:45.120> rocks<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.750> gas<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.160> coalesced

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
in rocks and gas and so that coalesced

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.099 
in rocks and gas and so that coalesced
this<00:03:47.790> together<00:03:47.940> through<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.359> same<00:03:48.600> process

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
this together through the same process

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.050 
this together through the same process
of<00:03:49.290> accretion<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.920> that's<00:03:50.459> how<00:03:50.700> our<00:03:50.850> moon

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
of accretion and that's how our moon

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.270 
of accretion and that's how our moon
formed<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:51.840> our<00:03:52.019> moon<00:03:52.200> actually<00:03:52.470> formed<00:03:53.130> out

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
formed so our moon actually formed out

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280 
formed so our moon actually formed out
of<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.430> giant<00:03:53.670> impact<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.450> mars-sized<00:03:54.959> body

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
of a giant impact of a mars-sized body

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.800 
of a giant impact of a mars-sized body
that<00:03:55.769> hit<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.040> earlier<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.850> then<00:03:57.180> coalesced

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that hit the earlier and then coalesced

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.289 
that hit the earlier and then coalesced
and<00:03:57.959> form<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.320> moon<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:59.209> it's<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.269> very

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
and form the moon so it's a very

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.210 
and form the moon so it's a very
fortuitous<00:04:00.720> event<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.769> we're<00:04:01.859> talking<00:04:02.130> about

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
fortuitous event and we're talking about

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.520 
fortuitous event and we're talking about
randomness<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.000> chance<00:04:03.299> in<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.140> universe

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
randomness and chance in the universe

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:25.920 
randomness and chance in the universe
and<00:04:05.150> arguably<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.600> one<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.989> those<00:04:07.140> events

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930
