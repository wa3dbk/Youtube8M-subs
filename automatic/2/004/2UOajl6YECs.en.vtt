trying to build enormous things we're
trying<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:02.220> create<00:03:03.220> things<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.640> haven't

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
trying to create things that haven't

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.990 
trying to create things that haven't
been<00:03:03.910> done<00:03:04.500> sometimes<00:03:05.500> things<00:03:06.250> don't<00:03:06.430> work<00:03:06.550> we

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
been done sometimes things don't work we

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000 
been done sometimes things don't work we
didn't<00:03:07.300> make<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.510> I'm<00:03:08.080> fully<00:03:08.440> confident<00:03:08.890> that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
didn't make it I'm fully confident that

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.320 
didn't make it I'm fully confident that
if<00:03:09.130> we<00:03:09.220> had<00:03:09.340> more<00:03:09.520> time<00:03:09.580> we<00:03:09.910> get<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> working

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
if we had more time we get it working

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.479 
if we had more time we get it working
and<00:03:10.570> that's<00:03:11.350> part<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.739> Engineering<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.310> just

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
and that's part of Engineering is just

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.949 
and that's part of Engineering is just
stepping<00:03:12.790> through<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.239> learning<00:03:13.450> as<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.810> go

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
stepping through and learning as you go

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.090 
stepping through and learning as you go
and<00:03:14.170> we'll<00:03:14.320> be<00:03:14.470> able<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> take<00:03:14.830> what<00:03:14.980> we

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
and we'll be able to take what we

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.790 
and we'll be able to take what we
learned<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.550> project<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.510> failed<00:03:16.800> onto

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
learned in this project that failed onto

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.300 
learned in this project that failed onto
another<00:03:18.010> project<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.730> isn't<00:03:19.120> gonna<00:03:19.209> fail

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
another project that isn't gonna fail

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.800 
another project that isn't gonna fail
while<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> team's<00:03:21.730> first<00:03:22.090> failure<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.780> a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
while the team's first failure is a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.680 
while the team's first failure is a
colossal<00:03:23.290> disappointment<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.700> 6x6<00:03:25.180> is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
colossal disappointment the 6x6 is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.780 
colossal disappointment the 6x6 is
lifted<00:03:26.050> away<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.350> be<00:03:26.680> put<00:03:26.890> into<00:03:27.010> deep<00:03:27.340> storage

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
lifted away to be put into deep storage

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.120 
lifted away to be put into deep storage
and<00:03:28.060> hopes<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.810> television<00:03:29.200> gods<00:03:29.650> may

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
and hopes that the television gods may

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.420 
and hopes that the television gods may
one<00:03:30.400> day<00:03:30.430> smile<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.420> again<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.260> our<00:03:33.160> team

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
one day smile on it again and our team

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.580 
one day smile on it again and our team
is<00:03:33.459> right<00:03:33.970> back<00:03:34.180> where<00:03:34.209> they<00:03:34.540> started<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:35.530> a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
is right back where they started on a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.830 
is right back where they started on a
long<00:03:35.980> hike<00:03:36.340> back<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.850> island<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.390> to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
long hike back to the island and to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.519 
long hike back to the island and to
their<00:03:37.989> next<00:03:38.380> prototyping<00:03:39.130> mission
