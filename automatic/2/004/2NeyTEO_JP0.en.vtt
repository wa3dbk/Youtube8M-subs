00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
film and it's composite because there's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.430 
film and it's composite because there's
no<00:00:43.350> way<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:45.260> see<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
no way that you can actually see this

no way that you can actually see this
underwater<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> density<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
underwater because of the density of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
underwater because of the density of
water<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:49.320> maximum<00:00:50.190> visibility<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
water your maximum visibility is a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
water your maximum visibility is a
couple<00:00:51.239> hundred<00:00:51.449> feet<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> can't<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.739> me

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
couple hundred feet so you can't get me

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
couple hundred feet so you can't get me
back<00:00:52.980> far<00:00:53.250> enough<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:54.120> like

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
back far enough to see something like

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.189 
back far enough to see something like

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.530 
I've seen or or want to see yep that I
can't<00:04:24.070> photograph<00:04:24.310> doesn't<00:04:24.940> exist<00:04:25.330> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
can't photograph doesn't exist the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.030 
can't photograph doesn't exist the
technology<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.350> can't<00:04:26.590> do<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.860> with<00:04:26.950> the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
technology you can't do it with the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.320 
technology you can't do it with the
lenses<00:04:27.370> whatever<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.880> is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
lenses whatever it is

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.580 
lenses whatever it is
so<00:04:28.510> my<00:04:28.690> stuff<00:04:28.900> looks<00:04:29.140> really<00:04:29.230> real<00:04:30.390> so<00:04:31.590> but

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
so my stuff looks really real so but

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.260 
so my stuff looks really real so but
more<00:04:32.830> importantly<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.610> coming<00:04:34.030> up<00:04:34.120> with

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
more importantly in the coming up with

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.600 
more importantly in the coming up with
the<00:04:34.360> idea<00:04:34.720> then<00:04:35.320> comes<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:36.130> how<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.400> make

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
the idea then comes that of how to make

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.760 
the idea then comes that of how to make
a<00:04:36.640> composite<00:04:37.120> reel<00:04:37.660> for<00:04:37.990> people<00:04:38.320> rather<00:04:38.590> than

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
a composite reel for people rather than

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.320 
a composite reel for people rather than
just<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.220> montage<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.940> bunch<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.210> different

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
just a montage of a bunch of different

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.690 
just a montage of a bunch of different
pictures<00:04:40.810> put<00:04:40.990> together<00:04:41.170> yeah<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.100> know<00:04:42.220> into

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
pictures put together yeah you know into

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.300 
pictures put together yeah you know into
and<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.540> think<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.230> have<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.470> get<00:04:44.590> past<00:04:44.920> the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
and so I think you have to get past the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.670 
and so I think you have to get past the
technology<00:04:46.180> people<00:04:46.720> have<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.020> look<00:04:47.170> at<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.530> oh

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
technology people have to look at it oh

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.260 
technology people have to look at it oh
gosh<00:04:47.860> it's<00:04:48.100> absolutely<00:04:48.550> beautiful<00:04:48.730> all<00:04:49.150> right

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
gosh it's absolutely beautiful all right

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.210 
gosh it's absolutely beautiful all right
you<00:04:49.810> know<00:04:49.930> that's<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.290> saw<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.920> way<00:04:51.160> but

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
you know that's I saw it that way but

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.700 
you know that's I saw it that way but

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
so so workshops in terms of how to work

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.460 
so so workshops in terms of how to work
with<00:04:56.650> concepts<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.880> come<00:04:58.090> up<00:04:58.210> with<00:04:58.360> ideas<00:04:58.990> hey

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
with concepts and come up with ideas hey

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.020 
with concepts and come up with ideas hey
ruff<00:04:59.650> so<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.890> know<00:05:00.010> you

areas we go to are amazing one of the

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.500 
areas we go to are amazing one of the
places<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.380> we're<00:05:26.680> going<00:05:27.010> is<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:28.210> Prince

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
places that we're going is in Prince

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.570 
places that we're going is in Prince
William<00:05:28.570> Sound<00:05:28.810> where<00:05:29.470> there<00:05:29.710> are<00:05:29.890> icebergs

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
William Sound where there are icebergs

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.960 
William Sound where there are icebergs
and<00:05:30.970> glaciers<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:32.620> we're<00:05:32.740> going<00:05:32.980> we<00:05:33.280> found<00:05:33.790> a

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
and glaciers and we're going we found a

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.630 
and glaciers and we're going we found a
boat<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.540> can<00:05:35.170> get<00:05:35.380> you<00:05:35.530> much<00:05:35.770> closer<00:05:36.130> you

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
boat that can get you much closer you

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.860 
boat that can get you much closer you
know<00:05:36.670> it's<00:05:36.850> not<00:05:36.940> like<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:37.090> cruise<00:05:37.390> ship

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
know it's not like a cruise ship

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.710 
know it's not like a cruise ship
so<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.200> gets<00:05:38.290> you<00:05:38.380> much<00:05:38.620> closer<00:05:38.920> these<00:05:39.340> things

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
so it gets you much closer these things

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.960 
so it gets you much closer these things
kayaks<00:05:40.720> and<00:05:41.020> get<00:05:41.140> even<00:05:41.440> even<00:05:42.220> closer<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.820> them

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
kayaks and get even even closer to them

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.720 
kayaks and get even even closer to them
so<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.390> experience<00:05:44.080> is<00:05:44.260> incredible<00:05:44.950> but<00:05:45.460> they

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
so the experience is incredible but they

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.070 
so the experience is incredible but they
you<00:05:45.820> know<00:05:45.850> that's<00:05:46.120> how<00:05:46.300> you're<00:05:46.510> going<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.720> find

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
you know that's how you're going to find

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.520 
you know that's how you're going to find
the<00:05:47.350> components<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.220> make<00:05:48.400> these<00:05:48.610> types<00:05:48.910> of

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
the components to make these types of

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.740 
the components to make these types of
conceptual<00:05:50.530> composites<00:05:51.250> totally<00:05:52.030> so<00:05:52.540> we're

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
conceptual composites totally so we're

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.560 
conceptual composites totally so we're
where<00:05:53.110> can<00:05:53.260> people<00:05:53.350> go<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:53.650> to<00:05:54.400> see<00:05:54.640> this<00:05:55.000> shot

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
where can people go to to see this shot

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.840 
where can people go to to see this shot
