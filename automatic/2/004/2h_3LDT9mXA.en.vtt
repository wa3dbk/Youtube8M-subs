00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello with you again I decided 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.940
 separately do with video camera quality 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.309
 iphone 4s 1 and built-in microphone test 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.580
 no headset new again yes repeat 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.949
 embedded means well what we see by 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 chamber here is a very good day 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 good quality that is of course up to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 my sony nex five does not reach but 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.300
 but it can take as long as possible 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.930
 there is at the same time heated but quite 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.930
 quite good quality 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.950
 equipped with electronic stabilizer 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.050
 slightly compensate for this shake 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.370
 hands when shooting but not much and here at once 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.379
 compared to galaxy s3 what can I say 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 There are not enough manual settings, that is 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.260
 there are practically no them you can choose only 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.110
 or 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 a camera that shoots you which 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 terrible resolution only for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.590
 video calls either this one which 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 very good in principle 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 shoots very well 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.479
 focuses on objects very well 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.939
 adapts to shooting conditions i.e. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 Here is my oldest here so there would be no 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.570
 here, as if everything is done, I will show you how 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 learn prezi 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 that is, almost instantly declared 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.200
 I think the distance is 10 centimeters 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.240
 just try a little closer here a little 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.590
 closer here already 5 centimeters somewhere 3 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.009
 even need a camera and also very fast 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.170
 she puts the focus back 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.030
 the color is also very harmonious 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.590
 I see snow 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:02.530
 basically normal white what 's another 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 the sun is like the sun responsible good 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.850
 nice nice camera only 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.979
 so lacking here very much 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.569
 message with the same 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.190
 sgs3 and with all android devices 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:18.640
 lack of some manual capabilities 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.500
 that is, the only thing you can do is 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.500
 select camera type and select 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.480
 well yes only camera type digital zoom this 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.400
 very dubious pleasure to us 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:44.860
 once sinned 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:46.450
 Payments Well, that is, I can immediately 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.250
 say i tried to shoot and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.440
 at night with artificial light then 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.350
 there is this day now till it is perfect 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.780
 the principle of shooting principle is such a back 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:03.760
 the light is very nice here so myagenko 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.530
 wears something I forgot and before I shot her 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.540
 in the evening with artificial light too 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.739
 behaves very decent noise and there is 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.540
 but for the phone it is tolerable 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.519
 as if it is so here I 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.840
 claims 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.769
 except the absence of manual settings and 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.769
 gain to her no 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.459
 interesting to see amum 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.459
 seemingly saw 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.650
 Here is such a nice example 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.070
 decent camera thank you all of all 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.070
 good
