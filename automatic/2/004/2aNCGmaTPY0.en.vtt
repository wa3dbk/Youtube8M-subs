00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.980 
addicting you'll start to get used to
that<00:03:41.220> little<00:03:41.520> legs<00:03:41.790> I'm<00:03:42.060> saying<00:03:42.300> apart<00:03:42.900> from

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
that little legs I'm saying apart from

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.170 
that little legs I'm saying apart from
that<00:03:43.080> game<00:03:43.590> ran<00:03:43.770> pretty<00:03:43.980> good<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.090> have

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
that game ran pretty good but you have

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.000 
that game ran pretty good but you have
to<00:03:45.270> run<00:03:45.390> everything<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.900> low<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.350> even<00:03:46.920> when

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
to run everything on low and even when

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.350 
to run everything on low and even when
its<00:03:47.130> own<00:03:47.250> low<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.670> seems<00:03:47.880> like<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.209> high

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
its own low it seems like it's on high

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.570 
its own low it seems like it's on high
some<00:03:48.750> reason<00:03:49.020> because<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.740> game<00:03:49.890> runs<00:03:50.160> so

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
some reason because the game runs so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.360 
some reason because the game runs so
smooth<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> lie<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
smooth like is if it was a lie and the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.370 
smooth like is if it was a lie and the
graphics<00:03:53.580> are<00:03:53.910> just<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.209> smooth<00:03:54.510> zombies<00:03:55.260> are

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
graphics are just so smooth zombies are

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.470 
graphics are just so smooth zombies are
smooth<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.550> I<00:03:56.580> far<00:03:56.790> from<00:03:56.910> these<00:03:57.000> little<00:03:57.240> legs

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
smooth but I far from these little legs

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.090 
smooth but I far from these little legs
and<00:03:57.750> then<00:03:57.990> there<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.260> these<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.740> really

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
and then there are these really really

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.740 
and then there are these really really
like<00:03:59.370> good<00:03:59.730> moments<00:04:00.120> where<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.270> computer

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
like good moments where the computer

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.580 
like good moments where the computer
runs<00:04:01.160> really<00:04:02.160> fast<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:03.050> it's<00:04:04.050> almost<00:04:04.410> as<00:04:04.560> if

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
runs really fast so it's almost as if

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.500 
runs really fast so it's almost as if
I'm<00:04:04.830> fast-forwarding<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.700> video<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.270> if<00:04:06.390> you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
I'm fast-forwarding a video and if you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.090 
I'm fast-forwarding a video and if you
get<00:04:06.660> used<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.080> controls<00:04:07.440> you'll<00:04:07.920> be

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
get used to the controls you'll be

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.710 
get used to the controls you'll be
playing<00:04:08.430> through<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.910> fast-forward<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.600> be

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
playing through the fast-forward it be

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.010 
playing through the fast-forward it be
like<00:04:09.840> um<00:04:10.050> if<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.910> like<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.120> matrix<00:04:12.270> except

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
like um if you like the matrix except

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.720 
like um if you like the matrix except
that<00:04:13.410> without<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.830> slow<00:04:14.040> motion<00:04:14.250> you're

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
that without the slow motion you're

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.340 
that without the slow motion you're
going<00:04:14.910> fast<00:04:15.120> motion<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:15.810> it's<00:04:15.959> like<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.320> know

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
going fast motion so it's like you know

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.930 
going fast motion so it's like you know
what<00:04:16.620> you're<00:04:16.739> doing<00:04:17.040> but<00:04:17.520> you're<00:04:17.700> just<00:04:17.820> moving

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
what you're doing but you're just moving

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.090 
what you're doing but you're just moving
really<00:04:18.270> fast<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:19.799> you're<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
really fast and you think you're the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.890 
really fast and you think you're the
only<00:04:20.130> one<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.489> zombies<00:04:20.850> do<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.120> too<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.630> it's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
only one the zombies do it too so it's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.080 
only one the zombies do it too so it's
just<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.140> very<00:04:22.380> very<00:04:22.710> fast<00:04:23.040> paced<00:04:23.520> game<00:04:23.640> at<00:04:23.970> that

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
just a very very fast paced game at that

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.620 
just a very very fast paced game at that
point<00:04:24.150> time<00:04:25.160> but<00:04:26.160> if<00:04:26.280> you're<00:04:26.490> unlucky<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:27.120> lag

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
point time but if you're unlucky to lag

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.590 
point time but if you're unlucky to lag
in<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.680> middle<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:28.980> fast<00:04:29.250> pace<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:29.760> you'll

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
in the middle of the fast pace so you'll

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.810 
in the middle of the fast pace so you'll
be<00:04:30.750> high<00:04:30.930> up<00:04:30.960> on<00:04:31.200> yourself<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.770> then<00:04:31.980> you'll

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
be high up on yourself and then you'll

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.580 
be high up on yourself and then you'll
run<00:04:33.270> into<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.540> crowded<00:04:33.840> zombies<00:04:34.290> cuz<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
run into a crowded zombies cuz the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.350 
run into a crowded zombies cuz the
game's<00:04:34.800> going<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:35.280> fast<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.850> you'll<00:04:35.970> shoot

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
game's going so fast and you'll shoot

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.610 
game's going so fast and you'll shoot
them<00:04:36.540> down<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.050> all<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:37.200> sudden<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.500> will

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
them down and all of a sudden it will

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.800 
them down and all of a sudden it will
lag<00:04:37.800> right<00:04:38.130> there<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.550> then<00:04:38.670> when<00:04:39.600> you're

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
lag right there and then when you're

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.270 
lag right there and then when you're
surrounded<00:04:39.990> by<00:04:40.200> all<00:04:40.350> these<00:04:40.500> zombies<00:04:40.860> mundane
