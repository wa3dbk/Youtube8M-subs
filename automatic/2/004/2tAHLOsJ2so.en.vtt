many of these extra batteries as you
would<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.800> purchase<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:09.240> is<00:03:09.450> 1500

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
would like to purchase so this is 1500

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.740 
would like to purchase so this is 1500
you<00:03:10.380> could<00:03:10.560> buy<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.740> couple<00:03:11.100> more<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.480> let's<00:03:12.630> say

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
you could buy a couple more so let's say

you could buy a couple more so let's say
you<00:03:12.780> got<00:03:13.080> four<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.380> them<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.220> got<00:03:14.370> all

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
you got four of them so then you got all

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.670 
you got four of them so then you got all
of<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.820> sudden<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.180> becomes<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.690> 6000<00:03:16.500> milliamp

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
of a sudden this becomes a 6000 milliamp

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920 
of a sudden this becomes a 6000 milliamp
hour<00:03:17.040> device<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.000> carry<00:03:18.270> off<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.720> these

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
hour device you just carry off for these

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380 
hour device you just carry off for these
batteries<00:03:19.350> with<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.310> after<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.880> use<00:03:21.120> one

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
batteries with you and after you use one

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.990 
batteries with you and after you use one
you<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:22.050> swap<00:03:22.320> them<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:22.920> out<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:23.940> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
you just swap them in and out now you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.610 
you just swap them in and out now you
may<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.180> wondering<00:03:24.360> how<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.170> know<00:03:25.350> what

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
may be wondering how do you know what

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.290 
may be wondering how do you know what
the<00:03:25.739> charge<00:03:26.010> level<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.610> or<00:03:26.910> anything<00:03:27.000> like

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the charge level is or anything like

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.780 
the charge level is or anything like
that<00:03:27.480> there<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.380> actually<00:03:28.770> an<00:03:28.860> LED<00:03:29.310> indicator

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
that there is actually an LED indicator

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.570 
that there is actually an LED indicator
built<00:03:30.150> into<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.690> housing<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.950> let's<00:03:32.130> take<00:03:32.340> my

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
built into the housing so let's take my

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.490 
built into the housing so let's take my
micro<00:03:33.120> USB<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.930> plugged<00:03:34.200> into<00:03:34.350> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
micro USB that I have plugged into the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.340 
micro USB that I have plugged into the
wall<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.310> once<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.700> install<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.350> this

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
wall and once you install that this

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.199 
wall and once you install that this
light<00:03:37.680> will<00:03:37.950> light<00:03:38.160> up<00:03:38.310> right<00:03:38.580> here<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.060> will

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
light will light up right here that will

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.880 
light will light up right here that will
indicate<00:03:39.510> whether<00:03:40.170> or<00:03:40.380> not<00:03:40.500> there's<00:03:40.830> any

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
indicate whether or not there's any

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.800 
indicate whether or not there's any
charge<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.640> let<00:03:41.760> me<00:03:41.880> plug<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.270> into<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.630> wall

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
charge so let me plug that into the wall

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.590 
charge so let me plug that into the wall
as<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.770> can<00:03:43.950> see<00:03:44.160> there<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.970> battery<00:03:45.390> pack

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
as you can see there this battery pack

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600 
as you can see there this battery pack
