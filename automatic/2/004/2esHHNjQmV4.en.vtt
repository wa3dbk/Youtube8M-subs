the back of his head was really long so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
the back of his head was really long so
my<00:00:45.690> mom<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.200> went<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> cut<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.700> the

my mom actually went in cut off the
extra<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.649> look<00:00:49.770> better

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
extra in the back to make it look better

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.430 
extra in the back to make it look better
and<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> did<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.690> took<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.989> brush<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and all I did was I took the brush and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.459 
and all I did was I took the brush and
then<00:00:52.680> swept<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> side<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
then swept it off to the side and I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
then swept it off to the side and I
spray<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> water<00:00:56.789> not

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
spray it with a little bit of water not

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
spray it with a little bit of water not
too<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.530> could<00:00:58.710> hold<00:00:58.920> its<00:00:59.280> place

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
too much just so it could hold its place

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.330 
too much just so it could hold its place
and<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:01.230> basically<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.129> style

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and that's basically all I do to style

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
and that's basically all I do to style
off<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> hair<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.210> usually<00:01:03.690> stays<00:01:03.930> like

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
off the hair it just usually stays like

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.539 
off the hair it just usually stays like
this<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.650> change<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.339> or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this I don't really change it up or

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
this I don't really change it up or
anything<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> side<00:01:07.350> swept<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
anything but I do like the side swept to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
anything but I do like the side swept to
look<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> reminds<00:01:08.729> me<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> Justin
