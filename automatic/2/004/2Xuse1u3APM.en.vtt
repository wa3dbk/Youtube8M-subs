00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
like a lot of people tend to just mash

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.680 
like a lot of people tend to just mash
it<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:14.280> press<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.819> slowly<00:02:15.300> just

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
it but if you just press it slowly just

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.080 
it but if you just press it slowly just
leave<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.020> gap<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.739> try<00:02:16.980> basically<00:02:17.489> attempt<00:02:17.970> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
leave a gap so try basically attempt to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.070 
leave a gap so try basically attempt to
hit<00:02:18.239> confirm<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:19.190> then<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:21.120> happens<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.720> if

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
hit confirm it then what happens is if

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.560 
hit confirm it then what happens is if
it<00:02:22.650> hits<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.459> first<00:02:23.640> hit<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:23.970> down<00:02:24.330> back

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
it hits it's the first hit of down back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.259 
it hits it's the first hit of down back
+<00:02:25.110> 3<00:02:25.260> +<00:02:25.290> 4<00:02:25.470> comes<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> four<00:02:27.090> will

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269

you can see you can see the down back

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.650 
you can see you can see the down back
free<00:02:49.350> plus<00:02:49.590> 4<00:02:49.830> foot<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.269> see<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> down

free plus 4 foot you can see the down

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.600 
free plus 4 foot you can see the down
back<00:02:51.870> people<00:02:52.739> ask<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.160> then<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.459> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
back people ask for and then you see the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.000 
back people ask for and then you see the
four<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.090> did<00:02:54.690> press<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.019> floor<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
four I did press the floor but the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.100 
four I did press the floor but the
second<00:02:56.340> hit<00:02:56.430> didn't<00:02:56.670> come<00:02:56.850> out<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.209> basically

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
second hit didn't come out so basically

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.680 
second hit didn't come out so basically
if<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.290> attempt<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.709> hit<00:02:58.950> confirm<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.690> he

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
if you attempt to hit confirm it and he

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.449 
if you attempt to hit confirm it and he
blocks<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.380> second<00:03:01.769> hit<00:03:01.890> won't<00:03:02.070> come<00:03:02.340> out

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
blocks it the second hit won't come out

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.930 
blocks it the second hit won't come out
so<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.540> makes<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.049> even<00:03:04.680> harder<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.489> people<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
so it makes it even harder for people to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.920 
so it makes it even harder for people to
deal<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.420> new<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.880> mean<00:03:09.570> what<00:03:09.810> you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
deal with that new so I mean what you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.830 
deal with that new so I mean what you
guys<00:03:10.049> think<00:03:10.320> it's<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.489> it's<00:03:11.610> very<00:03:12.510> very

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
guys think it's really it's very very

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.140
