00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
resurrection of a life of all children

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.640 
resurrection of a life of all children
of<00:05:16.460> God<00:05:16.640> we<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.240> count<00:05:17.690> them<00:05:17.870> on<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:18.110> string<00:05:18.530> of
