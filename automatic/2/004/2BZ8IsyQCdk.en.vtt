00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
them sometimes it works sometimes I'll

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
them sometimes it works sometimes I'll
be<00:00:30.300> able<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> take<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> drive<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
be able to take the drive out of the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
be able to take the drive out of the
enclosure<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.130> plug<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> into<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.690> system<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
enclosure and plug it into a system and

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.799 
enclosure and plug it into a system and
get<00:00:35.040> their<00:00:35.219> data<00:00:35.370> off<00:00:35.670> other<00:00:36.180> times<00:00:36.570> there's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
get their data off other times there's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.420 
get their data off other times there's
complete<00:00:37.200> failure<00:00:37.590> from<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> mechanical

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
complete failure from the mechanical

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.630 
complete failure from the mechanical
drive<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> said<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
drive so this like I said is a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.299 
drive so this like I said is a
ruggedized<00:00:42.149> drive<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.410> designed<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
ruggedized drive it is designed and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.330 
ruggedized drive it is designed and
tested<00:00:44.820> too<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> 120<00:00:46.289> centimeter<00:00:46.980> drop

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
tested too for a 120 centimeter drop

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400 
tested too for a 120 centimeter drop
which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.879> 4<00:00:48.180> feet<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.020> figuring

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
which is about 4 feet so figuring

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.220 
which is about 4 feet so figuring
knocking<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> table<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.480> desk<00:00:51.660> or

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
knocking it off of a table or a desk or

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
knocking it off of a table or a desk or
maybe<00:00:52.649> having<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> fall<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.610> backpack

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
maybe having a fall out of a backpack

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.510 
maybe having a fall out of a backpack
and<00:00:54.329> should<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.690> covered<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.649> shock<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and should be covered with shock and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.010 
and should be covered with shock and
without<00:00:56.969> damaging<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> drive

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
without damaging the drive

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
without damaging the drive
they've<00:00:58.590> also<00:00:58.800> experimentally<00:00:59.340> tested<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
they've also experimentally tested this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.979 
they've also experimentally tested this
one<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> 300<00:01:01.050> centimeters<00:01:01.500> drop<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
one to 300 centimeters drop to see if it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.310 
one to 300 centimeters drop to see if it

300 centimeters the one of the ways one

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.699 
300 centimeters the one of the ways one
of<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.569> other<00:03:25.720> ways<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.530> is

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
of the other ways that this is

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.559 
of the other ways that this is
recognized<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.700> does<00:03:27.819> have<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.090> suspension

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
recognized is it does have a suspension

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.990 
recognized is it does have a suspension
system<00:03:28.720> in<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.739> when<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.340> drive<00:03:30.579> hits<00:03:30.849> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
system in it so when the drive hits the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.030 
system in it so when the drive hits the
ground<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.420> suspension<00:03:31.989> system<00:03:32.139> is<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
ground the suspension system is going to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.150 
ground the suspension system is going to
kick<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.790> absorb<00:03:34.180> some<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.720> shock

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
kick in and absorb some of the shock

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.979 
kick in and absorb some of the shock
that's<00:03:36.160> really<00:03:36.579> important<00:03:37.389> because<00:03:37.750> it

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
that's really important because it

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.960 
that's really important because it
protects<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.470> mechanical<00:03:39.160> drive<00:03:39.430> inside

from<00:04:11.620> getting<00:04:11.980> from<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:13.110> mechanical<00:04:14.110> drive<00:04:14.430> or

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
from getting from a mechanical drive or

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.520 
from getting from a mechanical drive or
it<00:04:15.610> is<00:04:15.700> USB<00:04:16.060> 3.0<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.019> definitely<00:04:17.230> don't

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
it is USB 3.0 so you definitely don't

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.830 
it is USB 3.0 so you definitely don't
have<00:04:17.739> any<00:04:18.010> issues<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.640> bottlenecks<00:04:19.239> when

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
have any issues of bottlenecks when

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.180 
have any issues of bottlenecks when
you're<00:04:19.989> transferring<00:04:20.410> your<00:04:20.680> data<00:04:20.739> back<00:04:21.160> and

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
you're transferring your data back and

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.600 
you're transferring your data back and
forth<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:23.350> want<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.590> protect<00:04:23.950> your

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
forth so if you want to protect your

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.600 
forth so if you want to protect your
data<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:26.380> you're<00:04:26.530> traveling<00:04:27.190> around<00:04:27.280> with

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
data that you're traveling around with

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.100 
data that you're traveling around with
especially<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.510> you're<00:04:28.690> somebody<00:04:28.900> who

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
especially if you're somebody who

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.990 
especially if you're somebody who
travels<00:04:29.530> all<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.740> time<00:04:29.980> or<00:04:30.280> goes<00:04:30.760> between

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
travels all the time or goes between

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.700 
travels all the time or goes between
multiple<00:04:31.660> buildings<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.290> homes

multiple buildings and homes

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.280 
multiple buildings and homes
the<00:04:33.160> armorer<00:04:33.730> a30<00:04:34.120> is<00:04:34.330> definitely<00:04:34.900> something

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
the armorer a30 is definitely something

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.750 
the armorer a30 is definitely something
to<00:04:35.380> consider<00:04:37.290> this<00:04:38.290> one<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.860> not<00:04:39.250> water

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
to consider this one is not water

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.690 
to consider this one is not water
resistant<00:04:40.300> like<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.840> armored<00:04:41.380> a60<00:04:42.010> so<00:04:42.520> if<00:04:42.580> you

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
resistant like the armored a60 so if you

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.120 
resistant like the armored a60 so if you
need<00:04:42.850> some<00:04:43.120> water<00:04:43.660> resistance<00:04:44.230> definitely

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
need some water resistance definitely

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.350 
need some water resistance definitely
consider<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.820> 60<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:48.000> let's<00:04:49.000> check<00:04:49.240> out

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
consider that a 60 so let's check out

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.240 
consider that a 60 so let's check out
the<00:04:49.450> benchmarks<00:04:49.900> now<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.290> see<00:04:50.470> really<00:04:50.920> how<00:04:50.950> it

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
the benchmarks now and see really how it

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:27.440 
the benchmarks now and see really how it
performed

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.410 

so<00:05:28.410> we've<00:05:28.560> taken<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.950> look<00:05:29.100> at<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.640> drive<00:05:30.090> and

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
so we've taken a look at the drive and

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.150 
so we've taken a look at the drive and
taking<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.930> look<00:05:31.050> at<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.320> benchmarks<00:05:31.890> for<00:05:32.100> the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
taking a look at the benchmarks for the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.970 
taking a look at the benchmarks for the
silicon<00:05:32.700> power<00:05:32.880> armor<00:05:33.480> a<00:05:33.660> thirty<00:05:34.050> hard<00:05:34.740> drive

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
silicon power armor a thirty hard drive

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.400 
silicon power armor a thirty hard drive
so<00:05:35.580> this<00:05:35.730> external<00:05:36.090> hard<00:05:36.390> drive<00:05:36.630> of<00:05:36.660> course<00:05:36.810> is

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
so this external hard drive of course is

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.620 
so this external hard drive of course is
ruggedized<00:05:37.950> like<00:05:38.190> we've<00:05:38.400> said<00:05:38.700> you've<00:05:39.330> got

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
ruggedized like we've said you've got

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.750 
ruggedized like we've said you've got
these<00:05:39.870> lovely<00:05:40.590> nubs<00:05:41.100> that<00:05:41.310> are<00:05:41.400> going<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.580> keep

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
these lovely nubs that are going to keep

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.000 
these lovely nubs that are going to keep
it<00:05:41.910> from<00:05:42.090> hitting<00:05:42.330> a<00:05:42.600> taking<00:05:43.140> a<00:05:43.230> direct<00:05:43.590> hit<00:05:43.800> on

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
it from hitting a taking a direct hit on

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.460 
it from hitting a taking a direct hit on
the<00:05:44.100> ground<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:45.780> fact<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.170> they<00:05:46.410> are

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470

this is the one terabyte model of course

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.210 
this is the one terabyte model of course
so<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.850> drive<00:06:24.270> inside<00:06:24.750> performs<00:06:25.710> at<00:06:25.920> par

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
so the drive inside performs at par

but that's to be expected and but the
fact<00:06:33.720> that<00:06:33.810> you<00:06:33.960> have<00:06:34.200> USB<00:06:34.530> three<00:06:34.920> on<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.160> also

fact that you have USB three on it also

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.320 
fact that you have USB three on it also
means<00:06:35.700> that<00:06:35.850> you're<00:06:35.940> not<00:06:36.060> going<00:06:36.180> to<00:06:36.240> be

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
means that you're not going to be

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.230 
means that you're not going to be
getting<00:06:36.450> bottlenecks<00:06:37.140> from<00:06:37.350> it<00:06:37.500> so<00:06:38.280> I<00:06:38.610> hope
