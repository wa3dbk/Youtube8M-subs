that didn't have roofs on them and when
we<00:00:38.550> got<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.910> Alex<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.600> found<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> very

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
we got up to Alex we found out a very

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
we got up to Alex we found out a very
surprising<00:00:40.860> behavior<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.450> something

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
surprising behavior which is something

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.810 
surprising behavior which is something
that<00:00:42.960> he<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.500> sort<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.950> conditioned<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> do

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that he was sort of conditioned to do

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
that he was sort of conditioned to do
out<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.570> everyone<00:00:45.840> probably<00:00:46.200> thought

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
out there and everyone probably thought

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
out there and everyone probably thought
it<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.530> kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.800> cute<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.670> actually<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it was kind of cute but it's actually a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
it was kind of cute but it's actually a
little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.300> scary<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.960> something<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
little bit scary and it's something that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
little bit scary and it's something that
we're<00:00:49.530> trying<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.030> condition<00:00:51.030> him<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.719> do

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we're trying to condition him not to do

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.479 
we're trying to condition him not to do
especially<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.530> feeding<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.160> makes<00:00:53.340> him

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
especially at feeding time it makes him

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.310 
especially at feeding time it makes him
pretty<00:00:54.059> aggressive<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.660> pretty<00:00:54.870> dangerous

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
pretty aggressive and pretty dangerous

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220 
pretty aggressive and pretty dangerous
so<00:00:55.530> basically<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.730> he<00:00:56.879> did<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.870> any<00:00:57.989> time

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
so basically what he did was any time

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.569 
so basically what he did was any time
someone<00:00:58.530> turned<00:00:58.739> their<00:00:58.890> back<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.100> him<00:00:59.460> he

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
someone turned their back on him he

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
someone turned their back on him he
would<00:00:59.760> run<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.270> jump<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.260> he<00:01:01.379> does

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
would run and jump so see if he does

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.120 
would run and jump so see if he does
that<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:02.010> now

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.109
