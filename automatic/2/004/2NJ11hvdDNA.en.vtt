YouTube it was the first time for me to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.980 
YouTube it was the first time for me to
speak<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> subject<00:00:17.970> after<00:00:18.480> Jenny<00:00:18.840> on

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
speak on the subject after Jenny on

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.340 
speak on the subject after Jenny on
closed<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.619> Jimmy<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.430> us<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.789> closed<00:00:21.350> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
closed or Jimmy on us a closed and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.960 
closed or Jimmy on us a closed and
that's<00:00:22.560> why<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.010> such<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> somber<00:00:23.580> panel

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
that's why it was such a somber panel

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.460 
that's why it was such a somber panel
and<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.180> think<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> reasons

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
