00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.299
 here is the item ready for it 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.620
 a little decorate you can tie him 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.719
 fancy yarn and here's the same item and 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.400
 on the edge of a beautiful yarn here I have 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.550
 several types of fancy yarn 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 probably best of all this will be 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.890
 undergirding the easiest way here at 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.890
 we have a window between the posts 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.930
 the following 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.280
 and so on to the end but in order for it 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.500
 It was better to pay attention that all here 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.489
 This grass went on the wrong side therefore 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 it is advisable to do it from the inside out one more 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.820
 the secret must necessarily knit against 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.930
 wars and if we put a thread like this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 by all this beauty here lies and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.510
 hiding 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 so two rules on the wrong side 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.250
 and against the leopard but now let's see what 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 now we will 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:17.520
 the tail is laid here is a hole between 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.729
 columns and enter the hook and knit 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.729
 the most common column without nakida I 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.900
 a little shot 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.740
 to survey did not take a lot of time and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 here again bye 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.090
 I show here between the columns there is 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.900
 such here 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.150
 break into them we introduce the hook and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.100
 nakida column next here it is 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.380
 seen right here is easy and simple and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.000
 nakida column that's how it will be 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:00.990
 look from the front here is beautiful 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.610
 untie now we have described this detail 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.450
 if we were knitting in the face here it is 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.850
 would look so too maybe but not 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.250
 very and from this side looks wonderful 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.920
 Here I have such a little detail 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.769
 other fancy yarn 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.769
 it seems so great to me
