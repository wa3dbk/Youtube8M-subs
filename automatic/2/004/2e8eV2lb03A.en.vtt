00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.369 
much emphasize and elongate the eyes now
I'm<00:02:28.939> going<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.180> take<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.629> it<00:02:29.870> will<00:02:30.110> wing<00:02:30.260> out

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
I'm going to take it it will wing out

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.229 
I'm going to take it it will wing out
the<00:02:30.530> eyes<00:02:30.680> first<00:02:31.099> as<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.579> guys<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.909> see<00:02:32.090> what

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
the eyes first as you guys can see what

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.880 
the eyes first as you guys can see what
I'm<00:02:32.360> doing<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> video<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.349> then<00:02:33.799> I'm

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
I'm doing in the video and then I'm

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.640 
I'm doing in the video and then I'm
going<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.159> create<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.610> small<00:02:35.000> V<00:02:35.450> shape<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.049> then

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
going to create a small V shape and then

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.949 
going to create a small V shape and then
we're<00:02:36.829> just<00:02:36.859> going<00:02:37.159> to<00:02:37.459> fill<00:02:37.879> in<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.180> corner

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.630 

and<00:02:44.959> when<00:02:45.260> doing<00:02:45.409> this<00:02:45.650> step<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.159> don't<00:02:46.370> want

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
and when doing this step you don't want

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.789 
and when doing this step you don't want
to<00:02:46.760> overpower<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.659> copper<00:02:48.079> shadow<00:02:48.379> because

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
to overpower the copper shadow because

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.649 
to overpower the copper shadow because
we<00:02:48.950> want<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.430> focus<00:02:49.909> of<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.269> look<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.629> be

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
we want the focus of this look to be

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.649 
we want the focus of this look to be
based<00:02:50.989> on<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.500> neutral<00:02:52.010> colors<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.239> V

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
based on the neutral colors not the V

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:13.220 
based on the neutral colors not the V
shape<00:02:53.930> or<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.349> wing<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.829> eyes

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.470 

and<00:03:14.230> because<00:03:14.710> Hani's<00:03:15.160> eyelid<00:03:15.700> actually<00:03:16.150> opens

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
and because Hani's eyelid actually opens

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.900 
and because Hani's eyelid actually opens
up<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.720> lot<00:03:16.840> bigger<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.800> have<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> wide<00:03:18.340> eyelid

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
up a lot bigger and I have a wide eyelid

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.790 
up a lot bigger and I have a wide eyelid
I'm<00:03:19.300> going<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.690> try<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.930> close<00:03:20.170> up<00:03:20.410> my<00:03:20.560> white

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
I'm going to try to close up my white

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.130 
I'm going to try to close up my white
eyelid<00:03:21.280> by<00:03:21.460> adding<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.970> little<00:03:22.270> bit<00:03:22.360> more<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.900> I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
eyelid by adding a little bit more of I

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.890 
eyelid by adding a little bit more of I
shadow<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.160> top<00:03:24.370> lashline<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.480> I'm<00:03:25.720> taking

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
shadow to the top lashline so I'm taking

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.870 
shadow to the top lashline so I'm taking
a<00:03:26.140> black<00:03:26.380> eyeshadow<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.250> I'm<00:03:27.340> just<00:03:27.550> going<00:03:27.730> to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
a black eyeshadow and I'm just going to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.970 
a black eyeshadow and I'm just going to
line<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.240> against<00:03:28.600> my<00:03:28.780> top<00:03:29.080> lash<00:03:29.410> line<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
line the against my top lash line and

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.400 
line the against my top lash line and
this<00:03:30.490> is<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.910> hope<00:03:31.270> close<00:03:31.870> up<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.230> eyes

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
this is going to hope close up the eyes

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.950 
this is going to hope close up the eyes
or<00:03:32.770> more<00:03:33.070> like<00:03:33.220> close<00:03:33.460> up<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.820> top<00:03:34.180> lid<00:03:34.660> and

or more like close up the top lid and
this<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.680> going<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.010> also<00:03:36.190> help<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.730> eyes

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
this is going to also help the eyes

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:47.119 
this is going to also help the eyes
appear<00:03:37.510> bigger<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:38.140> wider

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.399 

and<00:03:48.129> here's<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.569> comparison<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.260> it

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
and here's just a comparison of it

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.259 
and here's just a comparison of it
before<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.010> after<00:03:51.220> just<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:51.849> that<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.090> can

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
tell what I was talking about when I

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.009 
tell what I was talking about when I
said<00:03:53.530> I'm<00:03:53.769> trying<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.099> close<00:03:54.310> up<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.670> top<00:03:54.700> lid

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019
