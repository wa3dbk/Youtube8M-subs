00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.080
 this week we remember precisely the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.719
 death of an antonio guzmán 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.760
 president that so far has been 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 one of the best that has gone through the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.619
 Dominican Republic says so many 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
 and this is an atypical interview 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.730
 Although our program is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.190
 entertainment we are always trying 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.810
 to bring you information that are 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.450
 valuable for current generations 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.250
 above all and for some of us who live 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.440
 those moments and we still have 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.789
 some gaps and some doubts about 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.289
 what happened that day precisely when 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.719
 another day we wake up with an information 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.940
 that dismayed the Dominican Republic 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.089
 I find the retired Major General 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.569
 adriano silverio Rodríguez an honor for 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:52.260
 we who are these cameras are 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:59.940
 here in your home thank you to be with 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.460
 you in your major general program 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.880
 retired and many people will wonder 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 but what is the closeness that this had 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.010
 Lord with President Antonio Guzmán 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.190
 accurate 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.800
 the day of your hand for that time I was 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.100
 second lieutenant of the escort army 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.170
 personal and belonged to what is and has 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.000
 been and remains the body of 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 military aides for the president 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.220
 of the republic and he was a bodyguard 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.410
 common how that service is always done 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.960
 and I was accompanying president because it touched me 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.850
 service that day of 10 men 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.460
 approximately that we were at 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.740
 escort that day was I was part of a 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.360
 group of six that accompanied him in the parc 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.270
 from this one when he reads where we were 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.210
 first until he wanted to come to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.030
 palace where suicide was perpetrated 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.920
 that everyone knows there is still 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.220
 the doubt of many Dominicans and it was a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.190
 suicide or if it was a murder was a 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.560
 suicide was witnessed by more than six 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.900
 men that we were with him in fact 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.250
 there was his son-in-law husband of his daughter who 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.789
 witnessed the law in the act 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.890
 the fateful event that so 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.830
 so much that crisis investigated precisely 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.650
 that's why he gave ocular evidence 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.720
 and he was an exception witness of that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.000
 done therefore it did not deserve even the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 investigation of the attorney general's office 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.980
 republic for that time because he gave 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.000
 record of everything that we were there 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.340
 we witnessed it was a suicide 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.190
 He sensed he jammed himself in his bathroom and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.410
 use of a firearm that he possessed and that 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.540
 He took it for his purposes, therefore 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.110
 he deserved not even an investigation 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.660
 because it is a proven fact in the act 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.550
 that it was a suicide I would like 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.330
 you will tell me how you observed the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.830
 president antonio guzmán that day that a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.650
 consciousness apparently was 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.600
 planning his suicide be a 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.880
 important question because it was the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.860
 prelude to what it looks like where 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.070
 the joint is addressed throughout the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.840
 day or the previous days from Thursday 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.900
 happened to Saturday the suicide the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.850
 President seemed like a person 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.640
 sad melancholy indeed 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.320
 a fact that seems to never 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.200
 know here it has not been known that he was 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.380
 disheveled and was not his was the usual his 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.870
 hair was a straight hair pretty good 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.390
 hairstyle always looked in the breeze of 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.060
 her hair was disheveled and she looked like she was not 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.220
 I was interested, it looked sad the truth that 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.740
 He was the person that I used to see 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.110
 when I was escorting in this 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.360
 opportunity is remembered if you okay 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.400
 he mentions that the president before the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.190
 normal step to the barbershop until the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.210
 armchair where it was usually trimmed me 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.770
 I imagine and committed suicide right there 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.990
 I imagine that you entered as 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.480
 as they entered I know that the door had 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.750
 sure as you told me outside of 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.150
 camera how those minutes went by then 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.430
 of suicide but once the 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.350
 shot we already assumed what was 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.600
 gone because we knew there was 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.990
 introduced a firearm 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.300
 to the bathroom then this one had sure the 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.150
 bathroom then had to break the door 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.460
 that was the crystal and wood then a 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.870
 captain I remember that colonel 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.900
 weather captain rondón 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.280
 Colonel retired from Rondón gave him a 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.150
 hit with the butt of the music 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 we used escort and broke the glass 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.810
 we put the hand we took the insurance and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.550
 We open the door when we open the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.430
 door we saw this show the 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.010
 president was fallen into the inside the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.260
 armchair borrowed in his head was 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.020
 fall to the left side with the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.120
 revolver hanging in his left hand 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.000
 he had shot himself under the ear 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.060
 we really took it we went out with him 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.190
 the balcony by the elevator that said and 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.800
 a lot of blood there we are overwhelmed 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.639
 blood and we put it in the limo 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.919
 that drove his driver a great driver 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.770
 from that time the lieutenant who for her 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.639
 I was older and a man from one of 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.340
 san isidro went to the hospital in that 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.440
 time the medium we dilate in the 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.289
 path no more than some five minutes 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.930
 they were already about twelve and so much 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:21.330
 the night and there was no one in a 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.689
 night hospital solitary the truth 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.639
 what 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.419
 a surprise to arrive with the president 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.589
 hurt and even though I do not have dead she 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:33.509
 the president made a pretty sound 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:36.119
 desperate not to talk did not speak no 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.039
 I did not know what to do 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.889
 I read the denture because used the 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.569
 denture that was false was removed and 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.539
 he then breathed a lot 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.279
 difficulty noticed blood through the ears and 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.269
 all parties and those dreams 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.789
 really tremendous and then they lasted in 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:55.469
 the operating room a few hours I have 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.289
 constancy because look man I say 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.559
 so I checked the time we left the 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:04.379
 palace and the time here we come to the 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:05.879
 hospital and exactly four and a half 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.849
 approximately the president died 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:11.889
 came out the doctor can I say or call 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.889
 nothing to do because he had already died 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.139
 he thought he thought not him 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.300
 the military but the Dominican citizen 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.509
 you see that the president of his country 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.969
 suicidal lives the last hours of this 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.740
 president and he thought it 's time 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.360
 I was going as he was going to tell the country or 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.509
 what would happen in the good country 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.749
 we really would have had some 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:37.710
 fears because we were supposed to be 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:41.139
 alone with the president we were witnesses 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.479
 of exception of this fact had not 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:47.229
 other witnesses and this 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:51.110
 we could not have affected the 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:53.570
 luck thank god that was 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.020
 as a witness also of the same fact his 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.600
 son-in-law husband of his daughter who downloaded 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.630
 any possibility that could be 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.260
 say what did not have to be said 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.410
 true something alien to reality that everything 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:13.130
 the world knows so that we had 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:16.100
 quite scary but sure that in the 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:20.180
 presence of his son- in- law was going to 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:23.210
 to have as a result that the truth was 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.080
 which will narrate and that became our 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:29.240
 respect from here for the family of 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.670
 president antonio guzmán fernández y 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.350
 especially the one that understands both 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.060
 the beings who had close to him and who 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.310
 They appreciated that we too 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.440
 what we did and what we will do in the 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.230
 memory of the Dominican people I will continue 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.510
 making a decisive or noble man who 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.850
 since he was 17 he had merits for his 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.070
 work and for your honesty and from here 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.590
 from an entertainment program with 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:55.360
 quite serious we put his memory 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.360
 up and forward we continue
