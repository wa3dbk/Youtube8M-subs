00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
I think it's year long i'm not sure if

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.200 
I think it's year long i'm not sure if
its<00:04:02.230> monthly<00:04:02.560> base<00:04:02.830> but<00:04:03.160> anyways<00:04:03.850> it's<00:04:04.000> only

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
its monthly base but anyways it's only

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.270 
its monthly base but anyways it's only
fifty<00:04:04.510> dollars<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.900> year<00:04:05.230> anyways<00:04:05.710> so<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.130> not

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
fifty dollars a year anyways so it's not

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
fifty dollars a year anyways so it's not
that<00:04:06.340> expensive<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:08.290> i<00:04:08.710> really<00:04:09.550> don't<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.940> mean

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
that expensive but i really don't I mean

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.440 
that expensive but i really don't I mean
years<00:04:10.630> do<00:04:10.900> go<00:04:11.080> by<00:04:11.290> fast<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.310> don't<00:04:13.240> think

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
years do go by fast so I don't think

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.830 
years do go by fast so I don't think
it's<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.860> really<00:04:14.860> good<00:04:14.980> idea<00:04:15.220> for<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.850> for<00:04:16.750> us

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
it's a really good idea for this for us

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.960 
it's a really good idea for this for us
consumers<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.590> course<00:04:17.830> but<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
consumers of course but for the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.670 
consumers of course but for the
corporations<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.930> course<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.410> know<00:04:20.500> they're

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
corporations of course you know they're

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.910 
corporations of course you know they're
making<00:04:20.710> money<00:04:21.220> off<00:04:21.669> of<00:04:21.880> us

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
making money off of us

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.740 
making money off of us
ah<00:04:22.980> but<00:04:23.930> whatever<00:04:25.130> its<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.090> what<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.330> is<00:04:27.420> you

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
ah but whatever its it is what it is you

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.660 
ah but whatever its it is what it is you
know<00:04:29.780> also<00:04:30.780> they<00:04:31.560> said<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.100> PlayStation

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
know also they said that the PlayStation

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.570 
know also they said that the PlayStation
3<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.170> it's<00:04:34.170> not<00:04:34.380> going<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.220> know

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
3 is it's not going to be like you know

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.430 
3 is it's not going to be like you know
don't<00:04:35.880> off<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> side<00:04:36.630> they're<00:04:37.260> gonna

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
don't off to the side they're gonna

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.580 
don't off to the side they're gonna
still<00:04:37.920> even<00:04:38.520> in<00:04:38.760> three<00:04:39.210> years<00:04:39.450> in<00:04:40.200> tops

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
still even in three years in tops

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.010 
still even in three years in tops
there's<00:04:41.010> still<00:04:41.340> going<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.550> be<00:04:41.870> supporting<00:04:42.870> it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
there's still going to be supporting it

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.800 
there's still going to be supporting it
very<00:04:43.350> highly<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:45.330> think<00:04:45.570> they're<00:04:45.660> going<00:04:45.750> to

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
very highly and I think they're going to

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.270 
very highly and I think they're going to
give<00:04:45.990> them<00:04:46.080> more<00:04:46.260> support<00:04:46.680> than<00:04:46.800> even<00:04:47.190> the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
give them more support than even the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.700 
give them more support than even the
PlayStation<00:04:47.820> 2<00:04:48.030> even<00:04:48.930> in<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.170> article<00:04:49.620> they

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
PlayStation 2 even in the article they

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.940 
PlayStation 2 even in the article they
said<00:04:50.480> this<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.660> their<00:04:51.840> exact<00:04:52.080> quote<00:04:52.320> typically

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
said this is their exact quote typically

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.610 
said this is their exact quote typically
history<00:04:53.430> can<00:04:53.640> help<00:04:53.880> us<00:04:54.060> only<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:54.690> far<00:04:54.960> here

we're<00:04:56.400> actually<00:04:56.550> still<00:04:57.000> selling<00:04:57.390> ps2<00:04:57.900> s<00:04:57.960> in

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
we're actually still selling ps2 s in

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.830 
we're actually still selling ps2 s in
regions<00:04:58.650> such<00:04:58.860> as<00:04:58.920> middle<00:04:59.510> such<00:05:00.510> as<00:05:00.690> the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
regions such as middle such as the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.630 
regions such as middle such as the
Middle<00:05:01.140> East<00:05:01.350> seven<00:05:01.740> years<00:05:02.070> after<00:05:02.520> we

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
Middle East seven years after we

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.440 
Middle East seven years after we
introduced<00:05:03.090> ps3<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:04.200> that's<00:05:04.350> pretty<00:05:04.560> crazy

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
introduced ps3 so that's pretty crazy

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.640 
introduced ps3 so that's pretty crazy
actually<00:05:06.450> think<00:05:06.690> ps2's<00:05:07.080> are<00:05:07.290> still<00:05:07.560> in

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
actually think ps2's are still in

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.110 
actually think ps2's are still in
production<00:05:07.860> by<00:05:08.250> Sony<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.910> it's<00:05:09.150> pretty<00:05:09.510> insane

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
production by Sony so it's pretty insane

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.540 
production by Sony so it's pretty insane
and<00:05:12.120> yeah<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.330> know<00:05:12.480> I'm<00:05:12.950> hopefully<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.040> ps3

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
and yeah you know I'm hopefully the ps3

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.470 
and yeah you know I'm hopefully the ps3
is<00:05:15.260> supported<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.410> all<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.830> because<00:05:17.100> on<00:05:17.970> the

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
is supported and all that because on the

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.050 
is supported and all that because on the
ps3<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:19.200> mean<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.590> graphics<00:05:19.980> are<00:05:20.160> outdated<00:05:20.700> but

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
ps3 I mean the graphics are outdated but

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.270 
ps3 I mean the graphics are outdated but
they're<00:05:21.630> definitely<00:05:21.960> not<00:05:22.320> ugly<00:05:22.590> at<00:05:22.830> all<00:05:23.010> I

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
they're definitely not ugly at all I
