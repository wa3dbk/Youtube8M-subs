00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 in 

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.130
 Yes 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.280
 so here we are at the ephemeral shop 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.510
 of coffee art direction tell me 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.340
 how were we approached for this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.349
 project I work a lot with the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.590
 creators for a long time as 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.250
 fashion editor as fashion designer 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.320
 so I think the choice is natural 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.970
 lack of it to make creators of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 to trust someone who since 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.970
 20 years was seen promoting their 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.220
 products 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.650
 I worked anyway for 17 years 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.840
 in the magazine she is there I could mix 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.390
 and local fashion and death is in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 national so my expertise 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 and pretty loose so I think it has 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 been a player who wanted so 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.700
 to attract have approached me in action 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 you do what it was what you need 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.400
 all that I wanted to put their 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.740
 products to 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.540
 said project the known product almost 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.610
 as a work of art as a product 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.030
 creative who were there who develops and 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.410
 elaborated that makes me think a little bit about 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.820
 the history of the museum in fact that they 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.430
 were the cabinets of curiosities at the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.160
 rebirth where people were accumulating 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.050
 objects of art a city I took this 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 severe weather all I said ok 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.430
 creating rooms of wonders or there 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.770
 the products that are presented are the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.850
 produce creators 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.760
 so that's it 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.830
 but how to 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.820
 it is the creation of asbestos my 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.560
 level the starter 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.430
 ted 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 ac in smaller 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.610
 the event is more like a shop 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.960
 settled on the street 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.200
 sainte-catherine in the old cinema 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.840
 Parisian with collections all about 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.630
 finish that space itself goes here 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.280
 for a few days and the creators we 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.790
 has given itself the mandate to make a 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.400
 collection for this event there in order to 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.950
 maybe work in communities 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.179
 around the village of brands try to 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.190
 show customers products that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.530
 are going to have only here at this 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.910
 moment also once and they do not 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.280
 will not be repeated we could not 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.010
 propose pieces that were found 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.920
 in store it had to imitate the parts 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.010
 that were produced and available to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.370
 collections ok for the event the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.549
 unique favorites that we can 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.549
 find 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.519
 it's in restitution well matched the 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.319
 fashion and prophecy of a general public all 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.040
 the world wins so any state party 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.830
 only that people and envied 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.860
 to invest in a small quality 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.420
 dress his request will be request a 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.020
 sudden interest my taste his request for 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.060
 recognition 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.010
 and then that's it you go there 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.150
 quietly as and when 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.550
 people are starting to buy 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.270
 clothes to invest in a pond the 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.390
 cave bar 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.400
 yes we need them from the consumer 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.650
 who loves clothes to be able to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.050
 to make the hands weary so that 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.840
 takes a complicity and so the clubs 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.360
 in fact the scholarships pub 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.160
 and the smokers cabinet project for that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.670
 twenty creators can introduce themselves 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 collections 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.340
 really inflated a professional caliber 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.410
 international 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.599
 empty products is rendered with a 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.550
 curator at the event went 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.160
 meet the creators for the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.470
 encourage to excel in the 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.330
 stylist work effect mainly 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.690
 on a job to do something 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.480
 which is also understandable for the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.849
 consumer there of a selection that has 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.569
 made around products and that is 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.069
 unique 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.560
 can someone come and spend a lot 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.629
 money here for a sony stone dress 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.060
 and can also read to buy something 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.100
 more accessible thing a t- shirt from 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.440
 the moria 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.440
 of cassava leather goods voss 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 fashionista so we have to be 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.680
 a lot 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.060
 jabber 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.520
 unsubscribe the lease of designers ford 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.860
 me it is important that the creators 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.920
 Quebecers working together in a 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.530
 collaborative atmosphere to work 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.830
 together developed this optics there one 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.729
 is reunited for a few days 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.879
 generous 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.620
 an appetite for creators I think 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.069
 that it is important that we are 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.129
 pride 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:01.480
 people are inspired by good practices 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:03.070
 others I think that all together 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.260
 did the shoulder competition 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.840
 stalled absolutely 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.580
 this project lasts five days is what it 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.100
 there is a possibility to review a project 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.160
 like this one but ideally it's 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.750
 redone in montreal at least once 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.340
 year but it is also exported to 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.870
 outside when we were going to develop 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.520
 international markets 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.410
 creators can group together 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.000
 still redo events is 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.250
 really like that in other cities 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.960
 and fashion week in new york where to go 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.240
