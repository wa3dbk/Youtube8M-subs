00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.690
 no doubt the fall say 79 37 of the American tractor in any case 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.799
 two of the three most powerful models in the 70 30 series to be manufactured at 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.289
 waterloo in the usa 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.859
 a maximum power of 2,134 horsepower a forward nation forward transmission 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.899
 a hydraulic circuit the 974 taxi the three minutes for 1 point 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.599
 the volume 3 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.179
 the 29 79 30 screened last March near Poitiers by two 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.280
 farmers is elsewhere christophe bringer adrien 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.660
 by a journalist from the magazine agricultural equipment to get through but all 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.660
 first stop at the inspection booth 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.690
 the engine that will equip time-there by arranging makes the last 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.600
 technologies so especially the injection like a dream talking about it all to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.630
 the hour a common ramp injection of high pressure infection 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.340
 for more performance 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.580
 we also found 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.980
 we have an exhaust gas recirculation system so the gases 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.060
 exhaust are recirculating the outside of the engine but they are 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.510
 also cooled reinject them 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.810
 through a giant wave that allows me to precisely measure the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.549
 amount of exhaust gas women's gas circulated 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.550
 that we will go back into the engine 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.920
 last particularity this factor is equipped with the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.310
 first a more torquey tractor the use at sales level remains 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.010
 the factor to a curve 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.290
 the celestial trait is at the level of their power level 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.520
 you have your power pretty quickly 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.360
 mines 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.220
 the 308 that in turn it will happen it piss maxi 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 and which makes that there is a very good reserve level of the couple since 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.870
 since the power in eemea ximum is reached very quickly we have 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.770
 even worked with just over 5 feet wide by twenty centimeters 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.659
 depth 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.850
 wanting to hear him from his tractor show 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.909
 for it's taken more and more force of 120 engine plus the 32 meters 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.450
 and then all used 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.400
 but it works well 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.460
 on the road 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 The tractor 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.510
 like any child asked for suspension 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.040
 so the equipped tractor 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.510
 dupont have suspended 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.180
 pls the field and it's a triple drop suspension that allows 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.440
 to offer a good level of comfort 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.909
 Auchan as on the road 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.439
 while also offering a very good pulling capability a 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.979
 third month that comes looking under the tractor under the center of 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:22.620
 severity 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.620
 so that allows to gain in grip to win 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.769
 the cabin how duo so access 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.769
 in fact it's clear 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.389
 and amateurs would call it routine 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.070
 all the goodness of diarrhea 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.600
 telescopic steering column for enriched version of walking at 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.750
 flying my armrests how tears with all the functions that are the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.150
 tilting controls distributors controls of regime transmissions 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.530
 engine or commitment commitment to the PTO so 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.500
 a large sized cabin the right active suspension seat for more 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.830
 comfort during road trips or in the fields of which the very good 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.510
 visibility that we cabin on the road we keep it of course in no way 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.659
 change 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.400
 e auchan e very good ergonomics our dishes suddenly we could use 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.559
 hydraulic so 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:18.259
 the multifunction color complex so there very easy to use a 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:20.839
 once it has been taken in hand if the tiny lever that falls quickly under 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:25.660
 hand so before that if the cabin-level job level one has 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.779
 % and users have noticed a 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.589
 a good grip in an easy grip 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.729
 at the color level in india transmissions 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:35.959
 arafat run out 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.049
 we also have two distributors who are 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.669
 that are easy to handle 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.049
 also the lift control not surprising effect cons by 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.819
 the dashboard levels the screen of 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.779
 of the screen lack of information and for 100 euros there is a little bit austere 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.509
 the use it lacks colors 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.329
 this one not very obvious but let's start with are not very 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.329
 intuitive 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.200
 I found a very good balance between them 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.700
 the weight of the tractor that must do I believe weighing 9 tons 331% to be 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.609
 specific 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.359
 with a bucket that was loaded with the 19 tons behind it went very well 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.530
 behaved e there again no slip issues% one felt 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.990
 although this actor who led the dance and that's the important thing when we are 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.319
 on the road
