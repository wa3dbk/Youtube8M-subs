00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
when I got got it was bad obviously we

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.870 
when I got got it was bad obviously we

said recently that water contamination
is<00:01:48.610> inevitable<00:01:49.120> well<00:01:49.870> yeah<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.530> mean<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:51.070> guess

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
is inevitable well yeah I mean I guess

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.800 
is inevitable well yeah I mean I guess
contradictory<00:01:51.910> or
