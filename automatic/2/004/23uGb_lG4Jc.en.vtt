00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
one feature that I've always really

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.380 
one feature that I've always really
liked<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.780> Mac<00:00:04.560> OS<00:00:04.950> 10<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.730> zoom

liked about Mac OS 10 is the zoom
feature<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:07.109> don't<00:00:07.379> remember<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.890> exact<00:00:08.340> key

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
feature I don't remember the exact key

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.150 
feature I don't remember the exact key
combination<00:00:09.330> i<00:00:09.360> think<00:00:09.570> its<00:00:09.830> control<00:00:10.830> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
combination i think its control and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
combination i think its control and
scroll<00:00:11.519> up<00:00:11.759> or<00:00:11.910> command<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.540> scroll<00:00:13.040> I've

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
scroll up or command and scroll I've

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.369 
scroll up or command and scroll I've
always<00:00:14.219> liked<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:15.109> one<00:00:16.109> main<00:00:16.350> reason

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
always liked that for one main reason

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.740 
always liked that for one main reason
for<00:00:16.830> live<00:00:17.190> streaming<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.880> would<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> great<00:00:18.390> for

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
for live streaming it would be great for

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.359 
for live streaming it would be great for
showing<00:00:19.350> things<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> stream<00:00:20.130> because

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
showing things on the stream because

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.340 
showing things on the stream because
obviously<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:21.480> can't<00:00:21.720> read<00:00:21.900> what's<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.199> my

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
obviously you can't read what's on my

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
obviously you can't read what's on my
screen<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.369> too<00:00:23.670> small<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
screen right now it's too small the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
screen right now it's too small the
camera's<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:24.960> even<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:25.560> enough<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.920> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
camera's not even get enough to do it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.320 
camera's not even get enough to do it
anyway<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.490> assuming<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.029> had<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> better

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
anyway but assuming I had a better

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.230 
anyway but assuming I had a better
camera<00:00:27.920> zoom<00:00:28.920> feature<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:30.060> be

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
camera zoom feature like that would be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.690 
camera zoom feature like that would be
great<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.779> Windows<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.740> couple<00:00:32.279> years<00:00:32.489> ago<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
great in Windows a couple years ago I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
great in Windows a couple years ago I
found<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.149> program<00:00:33.360> called<00:00:33.570> zoomit<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.649> did

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
found a program called zoomit which did

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
found a program called zoomit which did
the<00:00:35.160> job<00:00:35.370> okay<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.420> only<00:00:36.600> worked<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.140> one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the job okay it only worked on one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500 
the job okay it only worked on one
monitor<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> time<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> couldn't<00:00:39.360> have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
monitor at a time so I couldn't have

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
monitor at a time so I couldn't have
something<00:00:39.899> expand<00:00:40.290> onto<00:00:40.500> both<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.129> my<00:00:41.219> screens

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
something expand onto both of my screens

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.139 
something expand onto both of my screens
here<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.750> i7<00:00:43.020> computer<00:00:44.149> until

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
here that are up to my i7 computer until

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
here that are up to my i7 computer until
now<00:00:45.329> i<00:00:45.539> feel<00:00:46.110> dumb<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:46.800> i<00:00:46.950> didn't<00:00:47.250> realize

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
now i feel dumb because i didn't realize

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
now i feel dumb because i didn't realize
that<00:00:47.670> windows<00:00:48.210> already<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.440> feature

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that windows already had the feature

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.590 
that windows already had the feature
that<00:00:49.950> i've<00:00:50.039> been<00:00:50.160> looking<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.090> long<00:00:51.300> i

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that i've been looking for for so long i

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.060 
that i've been looking for for so long i
believe<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.050> only<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.379> windows<00:00:52.559> seven

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
believe it's only in windows seven

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
believe it's only in windows seven
though<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:54.030> called<00:00:54.270> magnifier<00:00:54.899> magnifier

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
though it's called magnifier magnifier

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
though it's called magnifier magnifier
is<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.309> unknown<00:00:56.879> I've<00:00:57.120> known<00:00:57.329> about

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is not unknown I've known about

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
is not unknown I've known about
magnifier<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> while<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> didn't<00:00:59.340> know

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
magnifier for a while what I didn't know

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.599 
magnifier for a while what I didn't know
is<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.140> magnifier<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.739> used<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.250> full

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
is that magnifier can be used in full

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.579 
is that magnifier can be used in full
screen<00:01:02.879> mode<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.239> thought<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> was<00:01:03.840> only<00:01:04.080> where

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
screen mode I thought it was only where

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.080 
screen mode I thought it was only where
you<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:04.830> put<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> bar<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you could put the bar at the top of the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670 
you could put the bar at the top of the
screen<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> followed<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.260> cursor

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
screen or have it followed the cursor

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
screen or have it followed the cursor
around<00:01:07.770> what's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.850> magnifier<00:01:09.299> over

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
around what's a little magnifier over

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
around what's a little magnifier over
the<00:01:09.750> cursor<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.350> found<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.369> last<00:01:11.549> night<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the cursor I found out last night that I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.890 
the cursor I found out last night that I
can<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.810> oh<00:01:14.659> if<00:01:15.659> it'll<00:01:15.900> work<00:01:16.340> yeah<00:01:17.900> there

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can do this oh if it'll work yeah there

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
can do this oh if it'll work yeah there
we<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.369> expands<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> both

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
we go see that expands on to both

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.350 
we go see that expands on to both
screens<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.130> can<00:01:23.130> actually<00:01:23.310> zoom<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.939> pretty

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200 
screens I can actually zoom in pretty
far<00:01:24.979> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.729> tiny<00:01:27.000> little

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
far you can see that the tiny little

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
far you can see that the tiny little
picture<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.630> facebook<00:01:27.810> made<00:01:28.259> pretty<00:01:28.799> damn
