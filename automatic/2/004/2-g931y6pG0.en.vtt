 I did not expect to meet such a huge snake in the Yenisei district. A type of vipers is divided into black and ordinary. This kind of black viper. She is the mistress of this rock. She was not afraid of me --- all who was gone by the fire and smoke, and clearly appreciated whether she could swallow me or not. And making sure that she cannot swallow me --- the creep creeping hunted further --- because I don't constitute food for her as food. Snakes and vipers --- swallow their prey whole or do not touch the big prey at all. To tear prey into parts snakes and vipers are not adapted --- itâ€™s not wolves for you. A pike and a snake are adapted only to eat prey smaller than their mouth the size of a whole. Be wary of rocks, steep slopes to rivers, stony dens and remember, on every rocky slope --- there is a scaly mistress --- called a snake - whether it be a viper or another kind of snake. No wonder the phrase is interpreted in the fairy tale --- the mistress of the copper mountain. On the slopes, snakes can easily hunt birds, nicely multiply dangling the tail from the slope in August and bask in the warm sunshine --- settled on a stone, it is easy to hide under a stone from an eagle owl, an owl, a hawk, and also huddled under a stone in a moss or cave survive the cold and fierce winter. The cliffs are paradise for snakes, black and common vipers --- they are mistresses there. Explain and tell the children that you need to look where you step and what you undertake when playing on the rocky slopes in the campaigns in the taiga and what threat the rocky slope conceals. And then the hostess of the snake, for a while, will give way to a rocky slope for enjoying the view from the slope on the most beautiful landscapes of our taiga.
