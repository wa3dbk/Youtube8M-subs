00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.390
 I look back on his official debut in the Euroborg 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.699
 contribute to a double feeling actually I think 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.329
 that today we just think they were very good 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.490
 we were dominant both times matches long 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.150
 a month only that also just had to come 2 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.199
 Here the world's top scorers are crowns for one season 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.899
 placed 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.329
 bass that delivered their signature put to him body that had ballin 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.359
 shot after month of may already have a chance but no more that they know how much too much 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:36.960
 washing man 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.930
 yes good man too good for that 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.200
 after that was too bad here is the shot 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.090
 and villarreal bass emerges from it 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 the end of Tuesday 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 bryan linssen 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.900
 he walked through the legs was played by the strong wind 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 reynders to make it but the lion 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.770
 who could not find him and you know he could not free me even 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.410
 ha that but it was the last minute decision if not it was 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.410
 not very well shot 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 all fall I think I played a great game 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 constantly full of hazards 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.969
 after returning to more goals than must without knowing 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.950
 haase has to look through these times 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.300
 then i think we just got it 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 issued a business card but after everyone admitted 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.750
 there is also ex who is back in the first minutes in the euroborg 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.679
 Yes it is 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.679
 no do that when I think it was kind of a lot 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.670
 fons a lot how they are one by one 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 yes that is the bigger point in a point 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.970
 at that whack who comes that view of the circuits you had to do it too 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.659
 opportunistic football 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.279
 but meanwhile a goal that they then intended to just stay 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.469
 because if you play football 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.469
 real but going to play the balls is of course not our qualities and 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.879
 give up otherwise you will automatically breathe more and cut them 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.039
 have an eye for the long ball and choose 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.039
 after then you shouldn't be too good either 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.949
 so indeed a few a few this moment so 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.819
 it is a shame I do it anyway we just go butcher is bigger than the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.499
 Winning pool were beautiful of course 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.499
 after one of the children 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.859
 for the rest of the series that was the stadium 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.390
 yes that is natural 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.939
 for me of course beautiful that I am in the wind 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.339
 you are used to and so you are 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.709
 He thought it was nice for me to make it for that reason 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.639
 next Sunday from PSV 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.189
 It's about it arrived from FC Groningen 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.469
 we create 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.509
 twitter he says before the game but he has to work really hard now 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.129
 nuon after a two match time also just to 400 lexence holes 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.730
 Evenings percent I fall out of four chances and that we then have to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 so home sense should only blame myself 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.109
 sometimes today the outside is going to turn pole and soon I'll be watching everything 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.979
 take the inside post 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.889
 In addition, we are all characters I have I have already open the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.559
 period cross of the fires 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.679
 bunch is now we have to make sure we score
