00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 hi all this is a tutorial on 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.150
 mapping of two types of images called 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.429
 also map angular maps ee here 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.549
 rectangular like wallpapers in the universe 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.420
 virtual world in blender 3d is col 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.390
 internal engine 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 blender render that with cycles this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 mapping allows you to make one 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 360 degree background with photographs 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.060
 of real environments very useful operation 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.179
 in some cases but not really 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 intuitive we will see four combinations 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.329
 that is, here it is rectangular or and map with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.309
 blender internal and cycles starting with 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 the blender internal rendering engine 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.329
 render for evidence 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 I'm using images taken online 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 look for example mirror ball textures 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 or and here rectangular background and here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 rectangular panorama hung map texture e 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 etc 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 ok let's start with blender return first 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 what to do is select the tab 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 world in the properties windows then 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.480
 switch to the texture tab in order to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 create a texture that will be associated 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.310
 precisely to the background in the universe 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.659
 virtual 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.820
 then we add a texture i mayor 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 movie and upload an image from disk 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.009
 or if already present in the project file 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.430
 using the browse image to be button 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.930
 linked the images here are the rectangular ones 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 they are rectangular images that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.490
 represent 360-degree panoramas of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 an environment in the upper half 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.110
 we find therefore from the horizon to the sky 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.780
 while in the lower half we have the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 ground or black if the floor for so 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 to say is not important because for example 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.970
 we will insert a digital plot in the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.409
 scene images eng map that in cycles 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.049
 we will call mirror ball 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.000
 are square format images 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.399
 peculiar aspect of the image itself and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.950
 circular and appears flattened at the edges 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.509
 like the photos taken with a fisheye in 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.790
 actually it is a photo of a 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.310
 mirrorball a reflective sphere that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.280
 precisely reflects the surrounding environment 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.380
 and when it is produced one must avoid 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.110
 to photograph the photographer 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.819
 however, let us return to the practice in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.770
 mapping card we have to change the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.350
 projection mode via the menu 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.780
 cordi born and here rectangular 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.900
 orami that rectangular eng map dai 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.950
 we have no mirror ball images 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.870
 still finished 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.440
 in the influence of texture section 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.000
 we must select horizon color 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.300
 let's go back to the world e tab 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.580
 select the real sky item 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.550
 literally there is no real sky 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.170
 that render with f12 changing 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.580
 from time to time the orientation of the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.320
 camera to see the result 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.320
 looking in different directions 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 let's move on to a new scene with the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.640
 rendering cycles engine where 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.710
 mapping settings for one 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 texture world are definitely more 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.190
 simple since everything takes place in 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.930
 tab world 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.970
 not only do we have the possibility of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.220
 see the real-time preview in the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.770
 3d view instead of having to start each time 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.780
 a render as with blender render for 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.570
 which we first change the mode 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.690
 viewport shading of the 3d view render 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.330
 and in this case the texture goes 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.820
 associate world in the homonymous card but 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.520
 it is also a texture image of 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.610
 one in byron ment texture ie one 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.230
 environmental texture to associate a 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.510
 texture a world in this tab 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.980
 first we activate the nodes then 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.380
 we click on the box with 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.920
 circle next to color and choose 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.140
 inv ironman textures the first thing to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.240
 do of course upload the image or 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.210
 with open and then choosing the disc 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.950
 or with browse image to be linked if 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.360
 the image is already present in the file of 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.820
 project because it is loaded 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.770
 previously at this point the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.080
 second and last thing to do is 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.720
 choose the projection mode in the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.630
 projection selector and here rectangular 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.190
 default entry for maps 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.490
 panoramic rectangularball mirrors 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.350
 for the hung up 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.200
 it must be said that a mirror ball will realize 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.330
 a good background for a certain openness 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.070
 behind and to the sides of the observer but not 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.620
 exactly opposite where it will come 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.330
 introduced an obvious distortion 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.980
 in reality these distortions are there 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.380
 also in the other combinations of 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.310
 modes and rendering engines but they are 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.350
 less obvious 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.300
 to solve this problem we can 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.650
 use multiple techniques such as one 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.370
 scheme of mapping nodes 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.620
 picture 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.520
 original but maybe we will talk about this 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.250
 another time 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.840
 as you may have noticed and how you can try 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.360
 first-hand looking online 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.760
 images here rectangular o and map o 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.220
 mirror ball to be applied to world in the 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.860
 your scenes the resolution of these 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.630
 images is of fundamental importance 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.940
 since the photos are stretched 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.560
 on the whole background a low image 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.479
 resolution will show effects of 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.449
 obvious compression in the rendering 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.610
 final good background images can 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.370
 also have more than 6 thousand pixels in the side 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.280
 minor or per side in the case of and maps 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.410
 and occupy several megabytes on disk 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.570
 so if you look for photos online 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.690
 put a search filter to search 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.970
 just great photos before closing one 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.919
 final consideration to make the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.110
 background textures of illuminants 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.090
 particularly interesting operation 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.370
 when the image used is a photo 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.860
 hdr informed and xr or precisely hdr in 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.810
 cycles we do n't have to do anything because 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.360
 this is how it is structured 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.530
 the rendering engine is implicit for 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.260
 regarding the internal engine 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.720
 blender instead render the only thing to 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.460
 to do is check the box 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.650
 environment lighting and set the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.630
 color from white default to sky texture 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.900
 well for this tutorial it's all a 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.900
 soon
