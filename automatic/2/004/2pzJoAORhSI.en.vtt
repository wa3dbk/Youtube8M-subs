00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.849
 This is the free Bible concordance project. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.090
 a concordance that is being edited in pdf format 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:10.230
 ef 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.169
 it was not the official a4 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.179
 and the size 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.390
 I'm going to teach here to lower this agreement. 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.460
 well with one also you help us after the agreement better to have a 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.989
 typing error 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.220
 I'll open my browser here 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.220
 and then the next fifth digital single 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 I'll dedicate here 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 biblical 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.790
 with a bite 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.790
 and I'm going to have a funeral 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.700
 nabil 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.190
 the cicv power 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 the official agreement I am not putting here in updated version 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 and here beside that pay them believe so far 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.439
 here the ticket until that moment the letter 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.710
 the complete 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.560
 I started shouting with agreement in December 2008 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.930
 until the last date of the last update 24 4 minutes is just click 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.130
 on here 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.470
 and then down that page but to him by a typist 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.810
 it was that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.890
 little 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 group click here dou ordered 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 hope some little seconds 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.410
 stay here now 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.360
 save bock file 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 I'll dance soon. 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.310
 came back 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.829
 finished 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.149
 I like to fight here 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.139
 I can lose 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.139
 is to have something that shows you now with these errors 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.819
 mozer but comment little if you find yourself 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.649
 what can and should dock 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.649
 helping me 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 I correct the following 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.159
 not weak and little myth 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 paula 2015 from paula or what 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.469
 the kuduro 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.919
 young people here 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.559
 that's when I trust june 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:59.689
 how to describe first with the child step but then there procult it of 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.540
 that space 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.179
 I did it all in one 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:06.029
 I'll check it out if all thai words are bold here now 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.539
 there everything written 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.309
 as well as the one I 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.189
 the abbreviation create 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.189
 abacus 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.390
 bold act 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.439
 check for a floor to be 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.599
 to invest instead of putting the potato that the speck 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.159
 on Saturday so it goes wrong because the air 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.520
 presents itself 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.439
 that word 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.439
 and in place of also lowering 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.650
 Where you work is already exhausted 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.650
 the envy the boot-down speaks 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.230
 This is also a very weak and little error. 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.269
 very frequent document you have to lower the tiles in the air 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.469
 Then I checked one by one. 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.409
 after the son that 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.409
 I'll check the following 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.449
 I'll check out the lepper department here. 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.909
 there was a way here 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.099
 kato 36 the envy that pulse two spaces if every hour that passes wide 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.589
 here i have 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.829
 studies today 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.739
 but only a spasm confront one by one tank is very frequent that I 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.340
 comment 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.340
 With what you have done, it's just a space here. 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.900
 Another mistake is that the committee frequently 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.409
 I really change that lps 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.379
 joseph very fl 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.779
 and it is because it is not the abbreviation of nor the biblical book 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.169
 cpc is fiction 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.770
 fm 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.930
 but from time to time the boat 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.819
 I think it's a very frequent mistake 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.219
 another frequent error competes very empirically 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.559
 This chronicles people know that here is super show that surely what you guys 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.770
 noel also that I comment I check here saw corrected robbery victim 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.580
 happened here too 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 you're in order bible king james timms said so 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.940
 I say this because the size of the human being 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.749
 I checked something that everyone 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.749
 the conferia and kiosks 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.379
 in this greater state of pm 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.349
 God is some god. 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.309
 more secular 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:18.449
 and that way I can change 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.689
 it is worth mentioning here I see the smile is that the goat thinks of protection because 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.689
 it happens 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.800
 another error here that I comment on 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.320
 and factory wada 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.120
 Here I have the tail. 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.819
 finished 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.150
 the page 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.050
 understand this is the factory 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.330
 here I have approached the bea arthur all the same here 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.800
 here percent 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.580
 this is all equal to what will change what comes next here in the cation of 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.620
 Bad claim 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.830
 pio buck efe is after d 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.069
 our factory that it is correct but instead the change 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.020
 low boxing a robot tab take 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.980
 who wants to stay 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.259
 each word is in order to fapec to lower to speak which one with them 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.529
 the question here 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.529
 Do you have it all in alphabetical order? 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.259
 a pecuniary thing to agreement 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.559
 the amount of references 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.619
 we have here in the market 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.789
 two javi debiting life concordance that is well known an escrivã here 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.789
 that you are seeing that the abbreviated biblical concordance 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.240
 The codace Biblical rules is with which it has 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.520
 Three times more 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.390
 the greater quantity than this biblical concordance which 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.889
 That's three times that even though it agreed free 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.119
 does not mean that they will be coupled to 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.069
 poor quality 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.740
 on the contrary it will be a product of excellence 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.740
 like who's doing things really the best man 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.339
 we also have in the market 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.990
 here the biblical key also 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.539
 this from here 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.889
 it is also well known 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:08.240
 and also 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.080
 will this be the purpose of biblical concord with what 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.840
 she stays three times more also the amount refers that the rate of 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.840
 dementia that you have 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.050
 That's why I'm counting on your help so we can 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:26.849
 make it compete bibi sings of excellence 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.309
 of was nothing for what they are on the market and that is beyond all free 

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.099
 because the kingdom of God he is 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:36.969
 free né 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:39.449
 in his thesis, he is very good 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:40.320
 God bless you
