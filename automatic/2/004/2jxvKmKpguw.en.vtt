better either going in the back now nice
and<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.560> once<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.490> engine<00:00:17.760> warms<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.210> be

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
and here once the engine warms up to be

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.200 
and here once the engine warms up to be
Illinois<00:00:20.390> heater<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:22.039> make<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:24.090> so

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
Illinois heater on make up here just so

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.420 
Illinois heater on make up here just so
the<00:00:24.449> water<00:00:24.630> will<00:00:24.779> flow<00:00:25.070> let's<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.220> what

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the water will flow let's see what

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:38.770 
the water will flow let's see what
happens<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:36.120> gas<00:00:36.329> twice<00:00:36.719> Tanna<00:00:37.290> choke<00:00:37.590> on

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
happens the gas twice Tanna choke on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
happens the gas twice Tanna choke on
Jill<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> water<00:00:40.559> went<00:00:40.890> through

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:29.630 

-<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> daisy<00:01:09.330> -<00:01:11.900> has<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.170> oil<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.520 

and<00:01:30.450> after<00:01:30.990> oil<00:01:31.290> pressure<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:33.200> find<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.380> what

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and after oil pressure I find out what

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.740 
and after oil pressure I find out what
oils<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.220> maybe<00:01:35.730> change<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
oils in this maybe change it to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:46.490 
oils in this maybe change it to
something<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.260> better

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:05.819 

only<00:01:47.130> rather<00:01:47.400> sad<00:01:47.790> hunting

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:35.180 

tabi<00:02:06.829> brother

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.580 

it<00:02:36.180> seems<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.290> main<00:02:37.560> jet<00:02:37.920> cuts<00:02:38.280> out<00:02:39.590> its

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
it seems like the main jet cuts out its

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.940 
it seems like the main jet cuts out its
primary<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.250> secondary<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.200> yeah<00:02:43.380> it's<00:02:43.680> Ron's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
primary a secondary and yeah it's Ron's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.460 
primary a secondary and yeah it's Ron's
and<00:02:44.190> he<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.400> stops<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.660> idle<00:02:46.110> feels

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and he just stops and it idle feels

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.490 
and he just stops and it idle feels
coming<00:02:46.800> through<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.720> I'll<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.080> work<00:02:49.290> here

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
coming through it I'll have to work here

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.680 
coming through it I'll have to work here
this<00:02:50.100> does<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.610> some<00:02:50.640> walk-off<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> as

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
this does have some walk-off on it as

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.100 
this does have some walk-off on it as
well<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:53.819> could<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.120> wiring<00:02:54.360> issue<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.959> come

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
well it could be wiring issue of come

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.309 
well it could be wiring issue of come
across<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.530> before<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.750> doubt<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.200> with

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
across that before but I doubt it with

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.809 
across that before but I doubt it with
this<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.680> reckon<00:02:59.069> it's<00:02:59.160> probably<00:02:59.459> all<00:02:59.550> setup

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
this I reckon it's probably all setup

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.640 
this I reckon it's probably all setup
wrong<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.750> probably<00:03:01.050> get<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> blockage

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
wrong and probably get a blockage

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.670 
wrong and probably get a blockage
somewhere<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.870> hear<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.110> make<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> weird

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
somewhere you can hear it make a weird

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:15.540 
somewhere you can hear it make a weird
noise<00:03:04.980> when<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.370> happens

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:28.690 

what

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.690 

shut<00:03:29.210> off<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.600> main<00:03:29.720> deck<00:03:30.100> put<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.220> batteries

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
shut off the main deck put the batteries

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.830 
shut off the main deck put the batteries
in

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
in

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.650 
in
stop<00:03:33.500> system<00:03:33.890> not<00:03:34.069> working<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.910> think<00:03:35.450> that

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
stop system not working I think that

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.650 
stop system not working I think that
once<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.900> go<00:03:36.080> here<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> visitor

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
once you go here I have a visitor

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.150 
once you go here I have a visitor
I'm<00:03:41.660> warming<00:03:42.019> here<00:03:42.379> in<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:43.720> yeah<00:03:45.010> don't<00:03:46.010> know

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
I'm warming here in it yeah don't know

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.100 
I'm warming here in it yeah don't know
where<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:46.519> vacuum<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:47.060> supposed<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.629> go<00:03:47.810> but

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
where this vacuum is supposed to go but

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.650 
where this vacuum is supposed to go but
all<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.290> know<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:49.760> went<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.209> wrong<00:03:50.390> spot

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
all I know is it went to the wrong spot

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.110 
all I know is it went to the wrong spot
because<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.739> puts<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.069> full<00:03:52.250> vacuum<00:03:52.519> there<00:03:52.970> when

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
because it puts a full vacuum there when

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.470 
because it puts a full vacuum there when
that<00:03:53.239> solenoid<00:03:53.930> light<00:03:54.340> loses<00:03:55.340> power<00:03:55.549> and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
that solenoid light loses power and

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.979 
that solenoid light loses power and
pulls<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.959> fuel<00:03:57.200> out<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:59.720> should<00:03:59.900> be

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
pulls the fuel out here that should be

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.570 
pulls the fuel out here that should be
events<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.560> some<00:04:00.739> description<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:03.370> we<00:04:04.370> just

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
events of some description so we just

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.390 
events of some description so we just
all<00:04:04.760> pollution<00:04:05.390> control<00:04:06.250> I'll<00:04:07.250> just

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
all pollution control I'll just

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.390 
all pollution control I'll just
make<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:07.849> it<00:04:07.910> works<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.690> don't<00:04:08.959> have<00:04:09.140> any

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
make it so it works but I don't have any

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.009 
make it so it works but I don't have any
reference<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.730> know<00:04:11.269> where<00:04:11.540> these<00:04:11.720> hoses

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
reference to know where these hoses

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.659 
reference to know where these hoses
should<00:04:12.410> go<00:04:14.440> I'll<00:04:15.440> just<00:04:15.590> make<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:15.950> work<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.400> you

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
should go I'll just make it work and you

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:26.590 
should go I'll just make it work and you
do<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:18.669> back<00:04:19.669> now<00:04:20.829> yeah<00:04:25.030> I'm<00:04:26.030> just<00:04:26.210> making<00:04:26.539> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
do that back now yeah I'm just making a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.629 
do that back now yeah I'm just making a
temporary<00:04:27.080> control<00:04:27.680> board<00:04:27.979> for<00:04:28.250> everything

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
temporary control board for everything

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.279 
temporary control board for everything
in<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.850> van<00:04:29.060> because<00:04:29.360> we've<00:04:29.780> talked<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.200> the

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
in the van because we've talked to the

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.200 
in the van because we've talked to the
customer<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:31.280> we<00:04:31.460> decide<00:04:31.820> if<00:04:31.970> we're<00:04:32.090> gonna

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
customer and we decide if we're gonna
