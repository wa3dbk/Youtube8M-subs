00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.230
 a toxic 744 is a second episode 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.510
 from minecraft if I have not done a long time 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.930
 one and we're here on a map that I'm 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.690
 doing 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.120
 and well I have here the temple see how 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.670
 you see and how it is seen in youtube videos 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.800
 to make epic mountains and then like 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.220
 you are seeing how they are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 mountains so they are as if there 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.220
 go out to earth sexes and good is that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.910
 let's create a new world is ivÃ¡n 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.870
 thays the lord player 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.100
 go a little slow 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.610
 ok ok let's put yes good of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 good creative and superflat let's create 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 new world then good is the following 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 it's commands let's take a villa 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.790
 let's take a meal like the apple 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.980
 and let's put bar bruce bar 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.920
 but I'm going to put some letters there 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.690
 there on the screen because they captured me 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.300
 got the right part and the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.610
 left a little bit good I'll put it there 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.550
 so you can copy brush sphere 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.100
 12 and the radio will be that I 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.100
 I recommend doing 3 we do well 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.320
 and fall to av vale is not thinking about that 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.790
 so it's worth 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.520
 It was something like that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.150
 and this is going to fall like that and it's going to be 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.590
 as 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.049
 I dont know 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.409
 it's going to look like that, we're going to do a 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 a little more 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.020
 and if we do, imagine two fingers going to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 be like more finer 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.299
 it looks great for this type of maps 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.009
 like the one I'm doing 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.009
 well epic mountains 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.610
 and good will be like the mountains 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.570
 will have this way we will not catch this 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.270
 so we're not going to catch the chicken 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.540
 I will put it what you would have to understand follow 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.920
 the navarra screen +12 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 space 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.220
 good plus 12 and now you put bar bar 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.250
 was 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.340
 yes bruce 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.030
 sphere 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.030
 one 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.370
 what is the stone and what is the earth 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.980
 we're going to see it like this 2 and 3 then when 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.380
 let's do so well let's both put 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.310
 of 6 to fill in faster as 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.300
 you see they make super epic mountains 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.280
 and the good thing is that what is a tutorial 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.440
 Very short, very short but that is very 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.940
 useful and that I would like to teach oslo for 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.670
 if you are going to make a map with little 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.200
 loader with single player com bands that 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.599
 someday I'll do a tutorial on how 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.450
 do it and good is this let's do 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.020
 plus 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.750
 not enough to see well 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.069
 burgess fer 12 and 2 ok let's do 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.010
 A) Yes 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.000
 let's make a bigger mountain 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.530
 or is going to be huge, more or less 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.530
 and it's super epic 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.830
 it's like painting you know how to paint and 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.990
 we already have that 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.270
 the bad thing is that if we do it 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.930
 directly on the ground you will make a 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.930
 hole in 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.870
 a hole is made inside as you have 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.930
 seen no 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.269
 as you have seen here 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.690
 that the hole has been made because the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.819
 sand traversed from the ground 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.310
 and good good 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.019
 try not to leave you a block cited sand 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.329
 the sand 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.430
 as it has gravity makes it fall 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.430
 imagine we are going to put like this not 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.830
 We put this if we were to make 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.830
 stone would be something like that 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.680
 and a mountain like that is not epic at all 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.560
 it does not apply at all 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210
 what is cool is the good sand is because 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.490
 I like the guys of likes and be 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.390
 served for something maybe they are more 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.210
 tricks of the emshi edit 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.210
 and there are other guys goodbye
