00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.480
 jo people I mean here again 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.360
 a new comments back 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 and what should I say the easter egg 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.630
 on hainan resort was found 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.240
 credits go to sz 1985 in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.740
 battlelog has found the whole and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 six tracks have the whole thing then 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 disseminated and I will be you today 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.689
 tell how to trigger that and what it does 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.880
 is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 but before we get to that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 Guess some of you know that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.340
 we are actually an easter tonight 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
 We wanted to make egg hunting where we exactly 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 want to investigate this systec 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.129
 do not worry the whole thing will not work now 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.020
 we will simply become something else 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.000
 we may become quite normal 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 but I do not want to gamble right now 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 here in the video count no all info 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.350
 you can find it on facebook and on 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.030
 twitter 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.250
 the links can be found in the description 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.680
 and there just looks in there and there 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.890
 I will post everything you know 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 so now we have to come to easter 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 egg I think that's pretty 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 exciting and I'm pretty, too 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 Excited because I can already say 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.850
 that is he so far the best thing is itself 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.010
 I've seen it in this game 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.570
 biggest easter egg and it is too 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.439
 really cool so i did not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.390
 disappointed 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.009
 I do not know some people have said 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.790
 I would have a little more 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.830
 expected 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.600
 but my expectations even have it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.930
 surpassed because it was not an easy one 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.270
 soundfile no it was much more 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.350
 but before we want to come to this 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.509
 Of course we will do it again 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 I simply say that now 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 So how was that because I have it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.200
 ever told in this video here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.880
 what was there for rumors and that was 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.509
 that so that his dice 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.220
 employee garrus on any 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.689
 dreamed of random battlefield 4 server 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 and has a chat lasting 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.100
 hey people wrote on this map 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.470
 is there any easter egg left? 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.479
 no one has found and the whole thing needs 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.920
 be activated somehow 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.420
 and that was already a bit 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.130
 Longer ago I guess a few 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.229
 weeks to a month 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 Of course, that's where the people are 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.179
 Battlefield 4 server streamed in crowds 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.039
 and just have this mistake 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.220
 but they did not find it 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.620
 the only thing found so a bit 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.260
 what was in the carton on the whiskey 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.390
 rally stands and he could always 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.840
 another secret announcement for 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.790
 Battlefield 2142 is there to that 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.720
 still nothing new but it could 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.300
 be possible 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.900
 but not really much 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.610
 found 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.130
 then there were still a few rumors 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.110
 to put those basketballs in the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.940
 Shoot baskets then have to have that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 of course many players tried 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.820
 you even tried that was 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.620
 not he breaks pretty cool here 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.690
 really taken time and tried 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.370
 to shoot this basel in the baskets 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.680
 It's not that easy 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.080
 take a long time but that unfortunately has too 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.880
 not led to success 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.800
 another theory was that one this 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.320
 can ignite oil stains 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.970
 there were also certain youtube videos where 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.550
 some by the source code of 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.950
 Battlefield 4 have gone around this 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.810
 Oil stains, so to speak, with the eee stick too 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.970
 connect that then have tried this 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.850
 Diagram of this logic diagram too 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.250
 decipher what you need to do with it 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.450
 the update activates that's not all 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.640
 I do not have that easy 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.560
 a lot of clue but in any case 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.110
 Then they said that to everyone 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.269
 to do with the oil stains and from him 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.310
 I also had oil stains on everything 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.810
 this map at the same time to light the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.150
 I really wanted to do it with you 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.370
 however, that would have done nothing 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.709
 because that is unfortunately not the carrier 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.290
 or that what you have to activate around 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.060
 not to trigger the easter egg unfortunately 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.620
 but of course it would be worth a try 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.720
 been because I think times have 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.430
 not so many people made it all yet 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.269
 one needs to light at the same time 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.010
 so for the 30 people but no that he 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.170
 nothing to do with the easter egg 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.450
 then we have not thought about 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.160
 that may be such an orbiter strike 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.200
 it could be somehow triggered 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.600
 Can and then the hotel in the middle 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.400
 destroyed by hainan resort you know yes 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.590
 This hotel is evolutionary 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.690
 destroy and we could have thought that 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.430
 also happen somehow differently by 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.610
 somehow as I said this orbit 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.350
 is calling or a death star because of her 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.820
 You know dice is now developing on star 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.130
 wars battlefront and there it would be 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.519
 Of course obvious if there are 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.680
 So todesstern coming up on the horizon 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.330
 but no, that's not it 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.290
 Of course it would be a bit cooler 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.110
 been 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.030
 it has something to do with the ship 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.850
 there is something stranded in two parts 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290
 broken and one can do something there 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.210
 bearers I do not want to say yet 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.540
 I'll just tell you how 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.030
 you make the whole thing the first step 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.710
 is that here on the hotel in the middle 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.180
 works best when you ride so that a 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.950
 lift up you can of course 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.810
 alternatively somehow from the jet 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.240
 jump off I guess that should 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.640
 Do not be the problem after that 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.160
 Get this sniper on the up there 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.200
 lying around the ground this is the amr 2 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.360
 you definitely need that 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.340
 and then there is on the edge of the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.470
 hotel so then best on this 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.880
 small hut on it now here 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.980
 you can also see in the background 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.590
 that actually carry quite well and then 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.630
 you look at the ship and at the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.060
 You will see ship after some time 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.640
 or if you are in the right position 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.110
 since a lamp you do not always see 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.520
 you have to go there a bit 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.890
 that's what you really do 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.460
 See and this lamp is lit from time to time 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.620
 on the light is not permanent and if 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.160
 you shoot this lamp then 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.160
 the following happens 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.570
 yes the ship is really real 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.340
 exploding that was no joke that was 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.350
 no special effect no that it 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.600
 really happened and my expectation 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.030
 it really excelled it has it 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.770
 swept away because I have with it 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.750
 calculated that just something small 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.850
 This somehow happens to be a sound arrow 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.949
 this is played something mini 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.840
 moderate happened but no it was 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.060
 really, what big one it was, so to speak 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.310
 second revolution element on this 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.229
 card what all people really see 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.900
 can and from which he my expectations 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.340
 were definitely met and exceeded 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.410
 You are welcome to leave my comments 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.990
 Write what you think about her 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.280
 too small so i find from isek find 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.259
 It's huge and I love it 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.660
 from dice that you install something 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.729
 that's just exciting this search 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.590
 It's fun to enjoy these videos 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.720
 and you are welcome to mine 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.180
 Comments write what he think about it 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.250
 and please go to the battlefield now 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.380
 server tries that out himself on the 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.270
 best on any full servers 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.919
 I think you might have some people 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.860
 with surprising that of course knows 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.389
 not everyone is just the fraction of 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.830
 battlefield player is also real 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.840
 on youtube on the way 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.970
 So just do that, I guess 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.080
 there could be one or the other for 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.610
 bring amazement 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.440
 of course I would be at this 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.570
 look forward to a review 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.260
 My name is more quest and I am 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.260
 out here
