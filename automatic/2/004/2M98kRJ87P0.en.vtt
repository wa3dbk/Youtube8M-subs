you<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.829> because<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.250> don't<00:02:29.670> want<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.909> put

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
you go because you don't want to put

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.319 
you go because you don't want to put
excess<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.810> water<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:32.250> first<00:02:32.579> petal<00:02:32.909> goes

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
excess of water the first petal goes

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:41.899 
excess of water the first petal goes
with<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:35.659> one<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.120> butt<00:02:39.439> finish<00:02:40.439> and<00:02:40.909> you

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
with the one for the butt finish and you

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.360 
with the one for the butt finish and you
want<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.269> do<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.629> little<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.139> higher<00:02:43.620> than

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
want it to do a little bit higher than

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.960 
want it to do a little bit higher than
your<00:02:44.609> Center<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.680> you're<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.889> have<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
your Center and you're going to have to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.550 
your Center and you're going to have to
add<00:02:48.120> some<00:02:48.150> glue<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:49.579> one<00:02:50.579> side<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.269> just<00:02:51.560> glue

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
add some glue on one side and just glue

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.349 
add some glue on one side and just glue
that<00:02:52.739> side<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> other<00:02:53.700> side<00:02:54.150> you're

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
that side but the other side you're

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.860 
that side but the other side you're
going<00:02:54.389> to<00:02:54.569> leave<00:02:55.220> open<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.480> I'll<00:02:57.480> show<00:02:57.810> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
going to leave open and I'll show you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.720 
going to leave open and I'll show you
why

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
why

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.949 
why
same<00:02:59.730> thing<00:03:00.060> you're<00:03:00.269> going<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> take<00:03:00.719> your

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
same thing you're going to take your

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.990 
same thing you're going to take your
second<00:03:01.439> one<00:03:02.450> put<00:03:03.450> some<00:03:03.900> glue<00:03:04.730> if<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.849> have

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
second one put some glue if you have

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
second one put some glue if you have
gluing<00:03:06.329> your<00:03:06.480> hands<00:03:06.719> clean<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.169> because<00:03:07.409> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
gluing your hands clean it because the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.649 
gluing your hands clean it because the
glue<00:03:07.919> will<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:09.409> prevent<00:03:10.409> you<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.620> actually

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
glue will not prevent you to actually

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.860 
glue will not prevent you to actually
paint<00:03:12.659> your<00:03:13.430> rose<00:03:14.430> petals<00:03:14.969> or<00:03:15.209> your<00:03:15.540> flower

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
paint your rose petals or your flower

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.210 
paint your rose petals or your flower
after<00:03:16.579> you're<00:03:17.579> going<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.879> put<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.979> in<00:03:19.979> your

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
after you're going to put it in your

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.559 
after you're going to put it in your
rose<00:03:20.750> almost<00:03:21.750> halfway<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.389> you're<00:03:24.389> going<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
rose almost halfway and you're going to

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.289 
rose almost halfway and you're going to
make<00:03:24.690> sure<00:03:24.750> they're<00:03:25.260> at<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.859> same<00:03:26.599> height<00:03:27.599> and

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
make sure they're at the same height and

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.129 
make sure they're at the same height and
you're<00:03:30.299> going<00:03:30.479> to<00:03:31.129> glue<00:03:32.129> this<00:03:32.310> side<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:33.139> if

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
you're going to glue this side and if

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.990 
you're going to glue this side and if
you<00:03:34.319> see<00:03:34.500> I'm<00:03:34.620> putting<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.069> glue<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.519> at<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you see I'm putting the glue more at the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.740 
you see I'm putting the glue more at the
bottom<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:38.099> flower<00:03:38.400> more<00:03:39.120> than<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.449> top

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
bottom of the flower more than the top

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.219 
bottom of the flower more than the top
so<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.530> glue<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.979> side<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.609> well<00:03:41.939> and<00:03:45.229> I'm

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
so I glue that side really well and I'm

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.499 
so I glue that side really well and I'm
going<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.769> put<00:03:47.009> some<00:03:47.310> glue<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:47.699> the<00:03:47.819> center<00:03:47.849> and

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
going to put some glue in the center and

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.890 
going to put some glue in the center and
this<00:03:48.599> is<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.169> start<00:03:50.120> gluing<00:03:51.120> them<00:03:51.569> I'm

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
this is just to start gluing them I'm

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.770 
this is just to start gluing them I'm
going<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.889> my<00:03:53.519> half<00:03:53.849> side<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.449> the<00:03:54.540> petal

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
going to have my half side of the petal

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.550

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
petal and I'm going to glue it make sure

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.729 
petal and I'm going to glue it make sure
they're<00:03:59.099> all<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.579> same<00:03:59.609> height<00:04:00.319> I'm<00:04:01.319> going<00:04:01.680> to

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739

they're all the same height I'm going to
open<00:04:02.040> my<00:04:02.099> first<00:04:02.699> petal<00:04:03.290> I'm<00:04:04.609> going<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.669> put

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909

some<00:04:06.629> glue<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.349> last<00:04:07.560> one<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.799> put<00:04:08.159> and<00:04:08.430> I'm

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
some glue in the last one I put and I'm

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.309 
some glue in the last one I put and I'm
just<00:04:09.449> going<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.750> fold<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.259> inside<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.930> first

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
just going to fold it inside that first

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.819 
just going to fold it inside that first
petal<00:04:13.909> that<00:04:14.909> I<00:04:14.939> had<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.569> I'm<00:04:16.289> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.500> put

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
petal that I had and I'm going to put

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.849 
petal that I had and I'm going to put
glue<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.400> at<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.909> bottom<00:04:18.289> not<00:04:19.289> at<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.590> top

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
glue just at the bottom not at the top

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.979 
glue just at the bottom not at the top
just<00:04:20.070> at<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.459> bottom<00:04:20.849> because<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.630> don't<00:04:21.810> want

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
just at the bottom because I don't want

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.400 
just at the bottom because I don't want
that<00:04:22.520> top<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.849> get<00:04:24.029> glue<00:04:24.330> too

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
that top to get glue too

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.240 
that top to get glue too
and<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:26.010> just<00:04:26.880> closed<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.840> there<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:30.890> make<00:04:31.890> sure

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
and I just closed it there and make sure

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.640 
and I just closed it there and make sure
that<00:04:33.080> my<00:04:34.080> petals<00:04:34.590> are<00:04:34.890> sticking<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.090> at<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
that my petals are sticking just at the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.910 
that my petals are sticking just at the
bottom<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.970> very<00:04:39.360> important<00:04:40.140> because

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
bottom this is very important because

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.730 
bottom this is very important because
this<00:04:41.700> is<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.940> stage<00:04:42.390> where<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:42.870> need<00:04:43.110> your<00:04:43.380> rose

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
this is a stage where you need your rose

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.340 
this is a stage where you need your rose
to<00:04:44.460> start<00:04:44.790> opening<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:46.490> it's<00:04:47.490> going<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.940> take

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
to start opening now it's going to take

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.130 
to start opening now it's going to take
the<00:04:49.350> edge<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.920> flip<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.270> little<00:04:51.570> bit<00:04:51.900> that's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
the edge and flip it a little bit that's

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.160 
the edge and flip it a little bit that's
what<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.440> don't<00:04:52.560> want<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.920> glue<00:04:53.070> on<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.220> top

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
what you don't want the glue on the top

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.310 
what you don't want the glue on the top
because<00:04:55.170> you<00:04:55.410> want<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.710> flip<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.250> little<00:04:56.490> bit

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
because you want to flip it a little bit

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.150 
because you want to flip it a little bit
so<00:04:58.320> your<00:04:58.560> flower<00:04:59.430> looks<00:05:00.180> like<00:05:00.420> it's<00:05:01.160> starting

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
so your flower looks like it's starting

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.330
