00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
anywhere they say you really got a

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.009 
anywhere they say you really got a
extraordinary<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:22.500> sound<00:02:22.909> because<00:02:24.019> they

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
extraordinary good sound because they

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.539 
extraordinary good sound because they
have<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.440> use<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.860> ultra<00:02:26.310> low

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
have they use an ultra low

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.360 
have they use an ultra low
signal-to-noise<00:02:27.440> ratio<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.709> harmonic

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
signal-to-noise ratio and harmonic

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.259 
signal-to-noise ratio and harmonic
distortion<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.549> so<00:02:33.239> I

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
distortion so there you can see it so I

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.420 
distortion so there you can see it so I
don't<00:02:33.629> know<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.349> check<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.829> out<00:02:35.040> but

there's written how you set it up but I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.689 
there's written how you set it up but I
mean<00:04:31.050> it's<00:04:31.199> pretty<00:04:31.409> good<00:04:31.620> way<00:04:31.830> pretty<00:04:32.430> good<00:04:32.580> to

mean it's pretty good way pretty good to

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.369 
mean it's pretty good way pretty good to
scribe<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:34.189> should<00:04:35.189> be<00:04:35.310> easy<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.610> understand

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379 
scribe so should be easy to understand

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
its pretty long by the way i don't know

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:22.790 
its pretty long by the way i don't know
how<00:05:15.690> long<00:05:15.750> it<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:18.199> 30<00:05:19.199> feet<00:05:20.930> no<00:05:21.930> 30<00:05:22.500> feet

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
how long it is 30 feet no 30 feet

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.760 
how long it is 30 feet no 30 feet
maximum<00:05:23.159> range<00:05:23.580> okay<00:05:23.849> it's<00:05:24.719> not<00:05:24.930> 30<00:05:25.199> feet<00:05:25.529> I

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
maximum range okay it's not 30 feet I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.950 
maximum range okay it's not 30 feet I
don't<00:05:26.370> know<00:05:26.460> how<00:05:26.580> long<00:05:26.759> this<00:05:26.939> is<00:05:27.180> but<00:05:27.779> its

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
don't know how long this is but its

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.760 
don't know how long this is but its
pretty<00:05:28.199> long<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.590> seems<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.919> be<00:05:29.009> long<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.770> then

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
pretty long it seems to be long and then

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.649 
pretty long it seems to be long and then
we<00:05:31.860> get<00:05:32.009> the<00:05:32.039> FM<00:05:32.520> transmitter<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:33.270> as<00:05:33.389> you<00:05:33.509> can

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
we get the FM transmitter and as you can

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.559 
we get the FM transmitter and as you can
see<00:05:33.690> it<00:05:34.020> does<00:05:34.229> have<00:05:34.440> three<00:05:34.830> buttons<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.210> it

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
see it does have three buttons so it

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.159 
see it does have three buttons so it
does<00:05:36.810> i<00:05:37.050> think<00:05:37.409> it<00:05:37.500> does<00:05:38.240> push<00:05:39.240> off<00:05:39.539> three

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
does i think it does push off three

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.200 
does i think it does push off three
signals<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.069> radio<00:05:41.490> station<00:05:41.550> for<00:05:42.180> a

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
signals to the radio station for a

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.480 
signals to the radio station for a
really<00:05:42.629> good<00:05:42.810> sound<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.409> mean<00:05:43.770> three<00:05:44.069> signals

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
really good sound I mean three signals

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.200 
really good sound I mean three signals
are<00:05:44.639> better<00:05:44.819> than<00:05:45.000> one<00:05:45.240> so<00:05:45.539> that's<00:05:45.750> how<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.159> how

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
are better than one so that's how I how

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.689 
are better than one so that's how I how
I<00:05:48.210> could<00:05:48.479> imagine<00:05:48.750> how<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.229> works<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:49.949> I

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
I could imagine how that works but I

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.159 
I could imagine how that works but I
don't<00:05:50.909> know<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.029> have<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.240> check<00:05:51.539> it<00:05:51.690> out<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
don't know I have to check it out and

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.809 
don't know I have to check it out and
perhaps<00:05:52.409> I<00:05:52.620> make<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.800> little<00:05:53.099> review<00:05:53.400> of<00:05:53.580> this

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
perhaps I make a little review of this

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.279 
perhaps I make a little review of this
so<00:05:55.639> yam<00:05:56.639> this<00:05:56.879> plugs<00:05:57.210> right<00:05:57.479> into<00:05:57.690> your<00:05:57.870> iPod
