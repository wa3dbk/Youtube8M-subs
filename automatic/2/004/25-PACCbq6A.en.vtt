00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 do you have 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.309
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.109
 a new clash of titans video in this 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.369
 occasion I wanted to make an attack a bit 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.500
 different that has not yet risen to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.119
 channel the truth is that I tried 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.130
 record several videos but they all have 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.560
 gone wrong then it never gets to go up 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.289
 none of the channel is worth this army 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.780
 consists of 30 hogs and then the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.100
 rest then it is a bit let's say variety and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.500
 because each could use what 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.720
 I would have also tried with 28 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 32 mountain pigs worth the same thing I'll 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.239
 do with the balloons with the village 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.960
 small but with pigs in the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.920
 big 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.809
 I have decided to bring 55 barbarians to 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.460
 take out the castle from the plan and then 21 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.710
 is left to kill him 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.359
 and the five magicians would be to go in case 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.010
 that I died in all the mountains 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.350
 pigs because if we say there are four 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.030
 defenses standing and they are at one end of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.920
 the village you can release five magicians 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.719
 we break and with the barbarian king go 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.489
 doing percentage and then try to 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.780
 take me two stars and the biggest 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.060
 amount of possible resources worth 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.759
 although at first the idea is to go to 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.259
 100% pigs ride at level 2 the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.149
 truth is that they are still pretty bad 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.670
 then I do not promise anything is worth in the 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.710
 castle I take a magician and the rest at 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.080
 you want but it can be 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.030
 not use it because it so try not 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
 that we are going to go and look for a village 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.979
 attack now that I have no shield 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.440
 I take advantage of what I'm looking for in a village with 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.540
 ride because it is more or less as it is 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.040
 let's say there are no spaces inside 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.050
 of the village so safer that neither the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.149
 transfer jump and giant pump and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.220
 then also also if they have many 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.220
 resources and defenses are not very 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.300
 high level then better than better not like this 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.119
 that I think we're not going to give him more 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.470
 turns and we're going to attack this machine 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.050
 because at least he recovered half of the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.090
 inversion of pigs in dark 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.700
 and it has the castle very easy the king very 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 easy so let's go there is going to come out 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 wizards 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.840
 I think the whole castle has left 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.780
 but let's ensure if only magicians and 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.759
 we are going to take the king out and in the process we take out 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.369
 there a trap jump a test we're going to 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.200
 look to see where we're going to kill them 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.709
 see I think that this area is the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.390
 better so let's see if we kill the king 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.160
 fast before the magicians arrive 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.400
 because if he is not going to kill me all the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.420
 squad of archers there we are going to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.950
 sit down if I bought you are also here 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.650
 so go and giving the Wizards 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.239
 some barbarians too 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.069
 to see if they finish with it I think so 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.590
 because the peloton is here as there 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.439
 it is already ahead is already going to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.629
 start the attack and I think the biggest 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.159
 premium of the pigs are the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.770
 magician towers so I'm going to start by 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.740
 here 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.640
 sometimes we give vouchers to all 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.780
 tests there are also tests 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.310
 you could see a giant bomb coming 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.290
 cure them 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.390
 let's go releasing some magicians for 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.409
 here 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.810
 more mounts pigs 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.299
 all the jumping traps we are going to 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.580
 roll up the I think we're going to 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.730
 cure the first ones here and in 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.010
 actually those over there and let's go 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.739
 releasing the magicians back here 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.959
 few that we have left with the barbarian king 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.299
 and I say that he mounts them because he does not 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.099
 they fit well but it seems that the 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.849
 attack is on track or is already 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.310
 three cannons and one has just been 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.590
 destroyed other study bases and 100% 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.690
 I believe that without any problem we are going to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.910
 roll up the king already so good 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.349
 come out the barbarians since they are 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.810
 inside what comes to be the wall 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.700
 and that there are no pitfalls anywhere 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.530
 we already know that they will not die 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.120
 they're going to take damage we do not let go of the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.170
 castle will not be necessary good 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.940
 here is another magician who has also 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.750
 survived making percentage for his 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.560
 account 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.730
 here he rides pigs that have left over 556 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.200
 we have left over the 4 567 about 8 more 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.540
 or less is not bad is not I the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 truth is that the village was easy 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.569
 defenses did not have very high level had 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.730
 a tower magicians a tower to which the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.800
 climbing the castle and the king and have 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.620
 and they died out easily 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.570
 it does not complicate me much in the future 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.040
 video I will do better but I also hope 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.810
 have them ride pigs to level 3 in 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.430
 briefs to the study of orlando oscuro 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.470
 precisely for them or for their viera 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.140
 king but surely climb the rides by 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.580
 post so nothing there you have 33 drinks 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.920
 How good we are not going upstairs 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.830
 but I do want to go up two now 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.810
 that making me farming like that went down 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.480
 too much and I do not like it either so 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.830
 thirty-three 325 glasses of dark 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.150
 this army comes to cost a thousand 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.090
 two cured more or less with mounts 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.680
 pigs to 2 then one third yes 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.630
 that has led me that they were not either 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.580
 it's better than not instructing dark and 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.370
 well what the spells think 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.760
 the ninth and then recovers as 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.990
 gold and he not much gold but good 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.180
 idea is to do one hundred percent either 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.820
 it was farm is already so the king with all 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.430
 life and awake luxury be better 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.710
 impossible so I'll tell ya I'll try 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.540
 look in the future for a better village and 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.220
 uploading more attacks is also 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.040
 unlock the goals recently I think that 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.630
 yes here I have them will also put them to 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.010
 test also never attacked with them 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.780
 nor with Valkyrie so little by little 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.580
 we will be talking about all the armies 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.580
 and see you in the next video 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.830
 the light 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.940
 A) Yes 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.940
 liked it
