to me I like it
I<00:01:09.540> actually<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
I actually don't have one like it so the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
I actually don't have one like it so the
other<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:14.010> more<00:01:14.130> generous<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
other one is a little more generous and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
other one is a little more generous and
the<00:01:14.909> eye<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> needle<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> left<00:01:16.740> then

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the eye of the needle on the left then

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640 
the eye of the needle on the left then
what<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.380> similar

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
what I have right now but it's similar

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.730 
what I have right now but it's similar
but<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.670> other<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.540> rather<00:01:22.170> large<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
but this other one is rather large and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.760 
but this other one is rather large and
it's<00:01:22.920> longer<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.600> knitting<00:01:25.500> tool

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's longer and then the knitting tool

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
it's longer and then the knitting tool
the<00:01:26.549> pig<00:01:26.869> he<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> nice<00:01:28.470> handle<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the pig he has a nice handle to it I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.310 
the pig he has a nice handle to it I
have<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.570> looks<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> grip

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
have a can so this looks like the grip

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.810 
have a can so this looks like the grip
is<00:01:31.470> good<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.130> concerned<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is good I'm a little concerned that this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
is good I'm a little concerned that this
is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> short<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> don't<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> how

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is a short but I don't have to see how

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
is a short but I don't have to see how
it<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.100> performs<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.270> looks<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.229> mine

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it actually performs so looks like mine

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
it actually performs so looks like mine
is<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.520> good

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
is in there pretty good

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.889 
is in there pretty good
but<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> little<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.450> soft<00:01:42.450> grip

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
but it's got a little bit of a soft grip

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
but it's got a little bit of a soft grip
to<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.950> longer<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.640> that's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
to it I like that it's longer so that's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
to it I like that it's longer so that's
kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.329> initial<00:01:45.780> impression<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
kind of my initial impression that's so

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.310 
kind of my initial impression that's so
far<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.149> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> liking<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.600> those<00:01:48.780> tools<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
far I'm kind of liking on those tools a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.469 
far I'm kind of liking on those tools a
little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
little bit but we will see how this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.260 
little bit but we will see how this
stuff<00:01:51.750> fits<00:01:52.020> together<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.460> mm

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
stuff fits together I'm a little like mm

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
stuff fits together I'm a little like mm
not<00:01:54.479> sure<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.979> actually

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
not sure what to do but it's actually

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.670 
not sure what to do but it's actually
smaller<00:01:56.610> than<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:58.110> hand

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
smaller than you think this is my hand

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.380
