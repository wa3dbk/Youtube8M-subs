00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you know would be kind of this big

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
you know would be kind of this big
alright<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.170> been<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> while<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.040> anyway

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
alright it's been for a while but anyway

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
alright it's been for a while but anyway
to<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.640> accessible<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> had<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to all be accessible and if you had a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080 
to all be accessible and if you had a
powerful<00:01:11.130> enough<00:01:11.250> machine<00:01:11.549> searchable

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
powerful enough machine searchable

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.230 
powerful enough machine searchable
that's<00:01:12.900> pretty<00:01:13.320> cool<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> idea<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.060> having

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that's pretty cool so the idea of having

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.410 
that's pretty cool so the idea of having
it<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.369> doable<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it all there is is as doable then the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
it all there is is as doable then the
question<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.530> mean<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
question is what do you get I mean is it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.859 
question is what do you get I mean is it
worth<00:01:19.950> doing<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> last

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
worth doing and I think over the last

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
worth doing and I think over the last
bunch<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.380> years<00:01:22.560> we've<00:01:22.799> started<00:01:23.040> getting<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
bunch of years we've started getting the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
bunch of years we've started getting the
idea<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> yeah<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.630> books

book looking interfaces that you know
how<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.180> sort<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.950> page-turning

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
how they sort of page-turning

fundamental sense and they start looking

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.050 
fundamental sense and they start looking
pretty<00:02:40.770> good<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.760> brought<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
pretty good and actually I brought a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.720 
pretty good and actually I brought a
bunch<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.709> pass<00:02:44.010> them<00:02:44.190> around<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.670> if

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
bunch so if you pass them around and if

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.280 
bunch so if you pass them around and if
you<00:02:44.819> really<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.270> I'm<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.630> put<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.140> your

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you really like I'm just put one in your

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.040 
you really like I'm just put one in your
pocket<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.770> write<00:02:47.459> because<00:02:48.150> frankly<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.930> only

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
pocket and write because frankly it only

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.509 
pocket and write because frankly it only
cost<00:02:49.320> me<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> buck<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> book<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.920> idea<00:02:56.280> is

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
cost me a buck a book so so the idea is

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.280 
cost me a buck a book so so the idea is
you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.910> actually<00:02:57.330> print<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:57.690> things<00:02:57.750> back

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
you can actually print these things back

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.930 
you can actually print these things back
out<00:02:58.500> again<00:02:58.680> there<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.310> now<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> couple<00:02:59.730> of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
out again there are now a couple of

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.530 
out again there are now a couple of
these<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.840> India<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> first<00:03:03.060> day<00:03:03.300> of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
these in India this is the first day of

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.990 
these in India this is the first day of
the<00:03:03.630> Library<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.080> Alexandria<00:03:04.760> when<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:05.880> were

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the Library of Alexandria when we were

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.720 
the Library of Alexandria when we were
doing<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.260> nearby<00:03:07.500> school<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.640> an

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
doing it in a nearby school this is an

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.910 
doing it in a nearby school this is an
engineer<00:03:09.150> working<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> kid<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.739> is

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
engineer working with a kid and this is

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.479 
engineer working with a kid and this is
the<00:03:11.070> first<00:03:11.340> book<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:12.420> kid<00:03:12.780> has<00:03:13.050> ever<00:03:13.080> owned

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
the first book this kid has ever owned

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.420 
the first book this kid has ever owned
so<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.580> idea<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.090> having<00:03:15.630> these<00:03:16.190> libraries<00:03:17.190> in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
so the idea of having these libraries in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.870 
so the idea of having these libraries in
digital<00:03:17.880> form<00:03:18.209> might<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.840> kind<00:03:19.350> of

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
digital form might have kind of

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.479 
digital form might have kind of
old-fashioned<00:03:21.019> service<00:03:22.019> models<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:23.340> are

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
old-fashioned service models that are

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.220 
old-fashioned service models that are
enabled<00:03:23.940> by<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.120> which<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.690> kind<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:24.930> took<00:03:25.079> is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
enabled by it which I kind of took is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.530 
enabled by it which I kind of took is
surprising<00:03:25.890> at<00:03:26.100> first<00:03:26.519> being<00:03:26.850> kind<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.299> geek

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
surprising at first being kind of a geek

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.209 
surprising at first being kind of a geek
but<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.590> does<00:03:28.769> make<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.310> whole<00:03:29.670> lot<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.000> sense
