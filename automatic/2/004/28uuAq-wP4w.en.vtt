 hello everyone and everyone welcome to me 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.069
 channel for all those from the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.020
 first time you saw me here on youtube 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.490
 and I do not know seems to see my channel here 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.969
 down in the clip I leave you some of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.370
 my videos and here and here as you see I have 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 also left a kind of trailers 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 so you can see what I usually do in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 videos contained in the channel rotates in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.519
 about beauty tips tutorials 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 makeup hairstyles how to dress in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.390
 certain occasions contests 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.599
 disguises but still there comes a channel 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.030
 that I leave here here on the left and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 down here in the description you will see that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.809
 those are not the only things you can 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.550
 find that I have millions of things 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.079
 more and before continuing with the video I 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.940
 I would like to apologize for this break 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.070
 four months especially to all those 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 that you have always followed me and that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
 enjoyed less my videos during 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 these four months and is not asking 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 for all the social networks that you have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.300
 happened because you do not study videos anymore 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.039
 to close the channel and I would like 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.989
 explain to you why it was all due 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.340
 this is why in today's video I 'm not going to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.360
 do the usual I will not do 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.100
 no tutorial 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.629
 this is going to make a video in which you 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.860
 I'm going to explain what happened to me and I'm going 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.290
 to try to explain how to do the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.510
 channel operation from 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.130
 now you will be asking all 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.440
 those who follow me you are and suddenly 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.520
 You saw that in my unemployment channel because 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.900
 stop uploading videos 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.140
 Well, I started college this year 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.090
 I did bachelor of science and I 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.660
 I always wanted to study veterinary but 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.300
 because of the note that I thought that as 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.620
 the previous year had been lower 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.000
 just in the year in which I had to 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.259
 do the selectivity and had to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.530
 access the career that I wanted 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.920
 finish and I study almost two points and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.140
 medium and clear I had prepared myself for 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.950
 the norm that had previously and not 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.530
 for which 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.969
 you really had given so I did not go 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.159
 in what I wanted that was veterinary 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.649
 but I entered here at the university of 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.929
 alicante in the career of law and 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.939
 criminology the double degree began the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.170
 course is a bit motivated because no 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.729
 was what he trains he wanted to study 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.369
 I have always had a student in 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.689
 area was a bit sluggish 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.759
 truly if you told me from the 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.789
 principle you will realize that the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.380
 videos that went up were not with so much with 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.819
 so often I was missing 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.340
 truly time to be able 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.660
 dedicate myself to youtube as I had been 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.319
 doing during the summer among others 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.630
 improving our cost you enough 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.690
 make me to the idea that I was in a 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.860
 race that I liked because it was my 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.860
 second option I said 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.240
 I like criminology because I can 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.340
 focus on the police issue all this from 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.700
 investigation 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.410
 and I did not like the idea but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.560
 the race that was not the one I wanted 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.090
 like I was unmotivated then that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160
 he did not accept me only to the land 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.360
 academic but also because in 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.819
 youtube was not with a job 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 and in the end because it required more time 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.110
 at the time of studying because it was not something 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.970
 that motivated me, I left a little 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 side and channel but along the taste 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.630
 it's true that I've been watching 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.630
 all the classes 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.330
 what career technical departures that can 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.350
 offer in the future I realized 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.730
 that it's a race that I'm going to 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 endeavor a lot in the course to 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.830
 get very good grades that I like and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.040
 It is also true that always the first 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.720
 year of career is more like general no no 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.760
 they specialize a lot in the race 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.050
 then this year I will have 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.270
 subjects that call me a lot 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.330
 attention as forensic medicine things that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.490
 I really like them and I have 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.050
 enough desire to start the sextet 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.510
 mind was this I had a bad time that 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.970
 need more effort when it comes to 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.820
 study that I could not dedicate myself 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.790
 entirely to record videos and edit them 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.980
 because of course it's not technically here 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.330
 exposed is to speak and already emphasized it turn 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.010
 clear this 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.890
 edit videos of watching your 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.480
 comments answer you because if I have 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.850
 a mobile channel I do not have to talk 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.460
 with you and for any doubt that 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.620
 you have to be there and I did not like it 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.519
 to be half- me and this I 'm not 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.780
 so then I decided to make a strike 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.700
 finished in the taste that when 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.500
 So I came back with more strength than 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.030
 never and then as a being no year has 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.070
 been quite overwhelming 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.770
 we studied was like disconnection 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.400
 total I was working also that is 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.669
 bottom 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.070
 at the beginning of summer so 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.740
 very little time to devote myself to 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.979
 all the others but now that I 'm back 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.590
 As I was saying, I wanted to tell you how 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.720
 do the channel dynamics that we are going to 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.000
 do what day are we going to see each other here in 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.430
 youtube and tell you that nothing this year 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.590
 I will be every Thursday in many 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.560
 other minutes you can watch a video all 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.139
 the weeks the objective and what I will do 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.860
 Well, some week it's impossible for me 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.270
 exams theme study whatever I'm going to 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.580
 always have some reservation video 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.500
 so that when it is impossible to upload 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.350
 you do not give me missing good 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.840
 basically this was all that very many 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.250
 thanks for all the comments all 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.000
 the support that has given me these four 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.710
 months from where I was 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.770
 commenting on the pictures that is one day 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.640

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.320

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.000
 experience here with you on youtube

 lose her why I'm here that does not 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.330
 I thought about quitting but that has been 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.390
 impossible to say truth that the five 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.550
 minutes but do not forget to rid of 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.370
