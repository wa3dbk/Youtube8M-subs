for a 10-inch skillet this will take

for a 10-inch skillet this will take
about<00:01:35.970> 1<00:01:36.450> cup<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> liquid<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.130> exact<00:01:38.549> amount

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
about 1 cup of liquid the exact amount

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
and proportion of stock the wine is not
crucial<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.329> feel<00:01:42.540> free<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.960> eyeball<00:01:43.229> it

crucial so feel free to just eyeball it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340 
crucial so feel free to just eyeball it
but<00:01:43.770> keep<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.430> mind<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.360> way<00:01:45.960> more

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
but keep in mind that you want way more

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.160 
but keep in mind that you want way more
stock<00:01:46.680> than<00:01:47.280> wine<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.479> sauce<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.020> be

stock than wine or your sauce will be
too<00:01:49.439> sour<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.630> usually<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.780> 1/4<00:01:52.619> cup<00:01:52.799> wine<00:01:53.520> to

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290

too sour I usually use 1/4 cup wine to
3/4<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.560> cup<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.770> stock<00:01:57.020> when<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.229> meat
