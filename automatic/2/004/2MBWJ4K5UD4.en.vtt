product correctly first thing you need
to<00:00:13.799> do<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.219> use<00:00:14.400> number<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:18.630> open<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> up

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
to do is use number one to open it up

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:29.990 
to do is use number one to open it up
and<00:00:21.630> put<00:00:21.869> some<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> CPU<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> want<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and put some on to the CPU you want to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000 
and put some on to the CPU you want to
sit<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> minute

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.420 

then<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.160> want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.500> use<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> lint-free<00:00:37.860> cloth

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
then you want to use the lint-free cloth

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.959 
then you want to use the lint-free cloth
and<00:00:38.790> wipe<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:46.820> after<00:00:47.820> that's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and wipe it off and then after that's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.920 
and wipe it off and then after that's
fully<00:00:48.329> clean<00:00:50.120> which<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.660> apply

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fully clean which I want to do is apply

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.389 
fully clean which I want to do is apply
number<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:55.370> now<00:00:56.370> let's<00:00:56.550> apply<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
number two now let's apply some of the

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
number two now let's apply some of the
thermal<00:00:59.600> surface<00:01:00.600> purifier<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> going

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
thermal surface purifier this is going

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
thermal surface purifier this is going
to<00:01:01.890> finish<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.059> completely

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to finish it up and make it completely

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.460 
to finish it up and make it completely
clean<00:01:08.119> put<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> good

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
clean put this on there put a good

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219 
clean put this on there put a good
amount<00:01:11.330> there<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> same<00:01:12.990> thing

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
amount there going to do the same thing

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.789 
amount there going to do the same thing
you<00:01:13.320> did<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:15.210> first<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.720> let<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> sit<00:01:16.740> on

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
you did with the first one let it sit on

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:44.640 
you did with the first one let it sit on
there<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> minute<00:01:18.049> then<00:01:19.049> wipe<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> off

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.160 

okay<00:01:45.370> now<00:01:45.610> your<00:01:45.760> CPU<00:01:46.210> should<00:01:46.420> be<00:01:46.510> fully<00:01:46.780> clean

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
okay now your CPU should be fully clean

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.410 
okay now your CPU should be fully clean
so<00:01:47.500> no<00:01:47.650> wait<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> second<00:01:48.430> as<00:01:48.870> it<00:01:49.870> evaporates<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
so no wait a second as it evaporates and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.390 
so no wait a second as it evaporates and
then<00:01:52.570> your<00:01:52.780> CPU<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.290> clean<00:01:53.620> ready<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.100> apply

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
then your CPU is clean ready to apply

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.090 
then your CPU is clean ready to apply
your<00:01:54.550> new<00:01:54.640> thermal<00:01:55.030> paste<00:01:55.620> now<00:01:56.620> you<00:01:56.740> can<00:01:56.890> also

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
your new thermal paste now you can also

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.230 
your new thermal paste now you can also
do<00:01:57.460> this<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:58.200> GPUs<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.530> heat<00:02:00.340> sinks<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:01.120> is

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
do this on GPUs and heat sinks it is

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.870 
do this on GPUs and heat sinks it is
also<00:02:01.480> recommended<00:02:01.980> if<00:02:02.980> you<00:02:03.100> do<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.400> have<00:02:03.670> this

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
also recommended if you do not have this

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.500 
also recommended if you do not have this
please<00:02:04.270> use<00:02:04.890> 91%<00:02:05.890> alcohol<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.300> same

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
please use 91% alcohol in the same

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.990 
please use 91% alcohol in the same
