even move around too hard while it's
drying<00:00:51.960> until<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> point<00:00:53.190> where<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.460> like

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
drying until the point where it's like

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
drying until the point where it's like
almost<00:00:53.969> dry<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> put

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
almost dry and then I just kind of put

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
almost dry and then I just kind of put
my<00:00:56.070> fingers<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.870> lift<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
my fingers to it like this and lift it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.270 
my fingers to it like this and lift it
up<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> root<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.649> has<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> bit<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
up from the root so that it has a bit of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
up from the root so that it has a bit of
volume<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.789> said<00:01:03.090> until<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> point

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
volume because said until that point

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.810 
volume because said until that point
it's<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.290> drying<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.920> flat<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.580> head

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's kind of drying like flat to my head

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.840 
it's kind of drying like flat to my head
and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> has<00:01:07.890> these<00:01:08.100> kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.400> uniform

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and then it has these kind of uniform

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.690 
and then it has these kind of uniform
waves<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.659> stick<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.140> together

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
waves that kind of stick all together

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
waves that kind of stick all together
and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:11.880> once<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.210> dry<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> start<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> let

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and then once it's dry I start to let

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
and then once it's dry I start to let
flip<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> around<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.979> play<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.610> lot<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
flip it around and play with it a lot I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.760

works best if you actually have lighter

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.010 
works best if you actually have lighter
colored<00:01:55.380> hair<00:01:55.700> but<00:01:56.700> um<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.060> never<00:01:57.719> tried
