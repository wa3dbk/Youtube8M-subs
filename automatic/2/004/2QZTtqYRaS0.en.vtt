good ideas over the farms like that to
poke<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.860> drive<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:23.070> down

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.480 

in<00:01:33.380> here<00:01:34.539> that's<00:01:35.539> that<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.649> where<00:01:37.009> they're

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
in here that's that is where they're

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.450 
in here that's that is where they're
making<00:01:37.729> honey<00:01:38.179> this<00:01:40.299> has<00:01:41.299> a<00:01:42.250> little<00:01:43.250> bit<00:01:43.399> of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
making honey this has a little bit of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.209 
making honey this has a little bit of
nectar<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.630> doesn't<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:45.219> really

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
nectar in it but it doesn't have really

honey<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:49.869> super<00:01:50.869> below<00:01:51.289> may<00:01:51.979> be<00:01:52.509> better

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
honey the super below may be better

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
and I and other beekeepers believe that

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.350 
and I and other beekeepers believe that
one<00:05:01.120> cause<00:05:01.539> for<00:05:01.930> Less<00:05:02.500> honey<00:05:02.830> production<00:05:03.360> but

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
one cause for Less honey production but

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.870 
one cause for Less honey production but
our<00:05:04.750> other<00:05:05.080> problem<00:05:05.770> there<00:05:06.010> is<00:05:06.100> a<00:05:06.130> parasite

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
our other problem there is a parasite

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.590 
our other problem there is a parasite
called<00:05:07.840> Aurora<00:05:08.770> mite<00:05:09.190> that<00:05:09.520> sucks<00:05:09.910> on<00:05:10.150> they<00:05:10.360> be

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
called Aurora mite that sucks on they be

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.270 
called Aurora mite that sucks on they be
and<00:05:11.130> damages<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.310> be<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.729> shortage<00:05:13.389> life<00:05:13.690> and

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
and damages to be in shortage life and

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.150 
and damages to be in shortage life and
if<00:05:15.280> not<00:05:15.580> treated<00:05:16.240> properly<00:05:16.750> will<00:05:17.590> kill<00:05:17.919> the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
if not treated properly will kill the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.469 
if not treated properly will kill the
hive<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:19.950> it's<00:05:20.950> not<00:05:21.100> just<00:05:21.160> one<00:05:22.120> thing<00:05:22.419> it's

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
larvae make the mist and if you have a

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.900 
larvae make the mist and if you have a
real<00:05:58.410> infestation<00:05:59.410> it<00:05:59.830> will<00:05:59.950> cause<00:06:00.190> honey<00:06:00.670> to

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
real infestation it will cause honey to

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.320 
real infestation it will cause honey to
start<00:06:01.210> dripping<00:06:01.980> running<00:06:02.980> and<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.850> bees<00:06:04.060> will

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
start dripping running and the bees will

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
start dripping running and the bees will
probably<00:06:04.780> just<00:06:05.080> move<00:06:05.590> out<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.160> hive

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
probably just move out of the hive

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.190 
probably just move out of the hive
but<00:06:08.520> there<00:06:09.520> ways<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.820> treat<00:06:10.360> for<00:06:10.660> those<00:06:10.840> EEMA

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
but there ways to treat for those EEMA

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.580 
but there ways to treat for those EEMA
also<00:06:11.800> we<00:06:11.980> use<00:06:12.250> another<00:06:12.700> disease<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:14.020> the

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
also we use another disease so the

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.100 
also we use another disease so the
problem<00:06:15.250> of<00:06:15.400> keeping<00:06:15.640> bees<00:06:16.210> helped<00:06:16.660> me<00:06:16.900> during
