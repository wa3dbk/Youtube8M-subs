 and at the beginning of the road to the one yes 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.010
 a new series or something like the last one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.230
 but more often this one will be here 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.769
 really continuous and constant 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.269
 come 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 already you do not see it and him 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.719
 normal roto the vision head-to-head the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.340
 means I will with all possible 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.470
 teams play here and me league 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 one of migazin from working up first 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 episode there is today the fc sevilla in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.000
 two matches because I forgot that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.710
 second cancel but is yes 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.060
 he does not care about playing with the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.460
 euroleague final participant and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 Last year's winner of this one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 European competition and yes you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.469
 I like to write the comments 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 which teams want to see next 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.290
 I am completely open to everything you can 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.579
 Write everything in and what's on 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.930
 Most set up it is also 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.760
 very important for us in the next 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 play episode that will be powder 23 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.879
 give games and or everyone will then 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.219
 again decided which teams as 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.320
 Next are questions for the faq 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.030
 because that's the main part of this video 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 yes almost the red the vision you hear 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 always in the background is not explained 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.840
 maria live videos or something like that again 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.100
 So do without gameplay with 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.020
 usually with gameplay background 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 yes ask for this vacuum you can 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.480
 put me on facebook left are one 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.250
 video describes this as a kind of facebook 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.660
 exclusive only my leica there we are allowed 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.220
 the questions ask here on youtube 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.540
 I will not take that into account 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.729
 as said as exclusive as it is for the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 people are a little bit more attached to me 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.180
 are interested in a certain way and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.049
 Wise thumbs up there 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 I would be happy about that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.290
 that shows me that you like this one 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 I have and I have a series right now 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.369
 clearly that one takes to zero there 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.930
 vl sometimes shoots the question list 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.250
 and we have very interesting today 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.780
 I have to keep up with it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.430
 I have already liked it once 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.960
 and it was pretty close 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 that's why videos started me 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.450
 I've seen myself, too 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.270
 relatively quickly answered messi or 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 ronaldo and then best measure better 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.659
 is about massive because that's because 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 that barcelona is extremely good real after 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 Formal crisis is and messi currently too 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.770
 one piece is better than Ronaldo 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 individually in my opinion of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.630
 so at the moment it's messi so my idol 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 yes, more or less my dad that is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 normal so at the young stands so 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.790
 is quite normal from the bocco in 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.560
 In a certain way, I also have 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.270
 Children made my motto days easy 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.049
 because of the so-called loyalty and so on 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.630
 on and on 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.159
 yes reflects so embodied and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.960
 footballing it is such a 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.130
 like Cristiano Ronaldo even if that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.649
 Of course very high is 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.570
 something athletic something Euro-stop package 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.929
 just what I am not but what I am 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.560
 working reasonably hence the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.990
 football are synonymous right away 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.670
 position in real life right with 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.680
 I play the most at the moment I like 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.850
 but the striker would prefer that much 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.890
 on this topic I will become a school 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.700
 you now times I do not know Show 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.950
 not how to hold are definitely 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.450
 relative and I got my got 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.230
 after I started again 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.220
 football sometimes question 6 and that is 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 like a friend 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.640
 that's how can the fans but with sky 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.530
 wants to advertise 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.390
 the relatively critical I have that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.410
 thinks that you would be my plan c 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.850
 I really want to do that 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 because when I see that at béla réthy 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.150
 or marcel ripe commented the little 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.880
 crisis or a fritz of thurn and taxis 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.990
 I think I can do better but there 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.210
 is in any case continue to run and 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.250
 difficult way and that is my plan 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.050
 b if that is not clear or plan b 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.390
 possibly even the flottiest flaps 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.740
 should then sports management or just like that 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 What won in the first game first 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.460
 against manunited first point so would be 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.810
 my friends met by the 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.310
 School already the eighth grade or something 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.020
 something like now in the second time together 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.280
 and this time was never together we have 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.740
 only what got hungry and now 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 We've been together for over six months 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.340
 the worst thing that happened to me as 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.720
 my godfather died that is very 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.740
 privately so not so exact 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.090
 but it was really pretty 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.560
 hard time straight from my mother soon 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.970
 in ruda was mine because mine 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.590
 godson old was so that was already 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.440
 not so bad as it is very sudden 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.330
 came to her live football come but videos 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.970
 It may well be me now 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.350
 canon legria mini ex orders that is 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.360
 future when the locs are all exactly 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.920
 Shaved on facebook visit 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.510
 and so on and so forth 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.970
 Accordingly , the trio live 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.550
 I'm doing quite possible with the dumbbell is 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.080
 are all the more difficult because well 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.430
 the hanseboot in bavaria i do not live 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.630
 in Bavaria I was here we Saxony 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.340
 see us at most once more on the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.960
 gamescom and therefore maybe too 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.070
 times gamescom trailer video on football 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.720
 if I do not take a football with 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.880
 I tend not to tend to think so 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.130
 in addition to football with so therefore 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.450
 We are very good next again 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.400
 videos just answered you quasi 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.500
 in the future it will give more often the channel 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.600
 becomes so 20 80 15 85 fifa and parried 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.950
 I'll be laid out in the train 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.450
 what my favorite series 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.740
 that's what my future has got 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.430
 even it does not matter what my 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.780
 favorite series 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.100
 I'm watching breaking bad right now 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.750
 extremely enthusiastic about it also elements 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.610
 my friends are also very enthusiastic 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.750
 but of considerable seriousness and remains dr 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.130
 house there is nothing to shake it 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.900
 if I had a super power which 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.730
 I would like to have, if relatively 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.180
 easy to answer i would be if i did 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.919
 me so the marvel heroes 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.990
 something like that quite like to stop right 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.400
 strong is a lot but the type is just 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.110
 he can jump that far just fine 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.460
 Weighing and so on but he is 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.930
 monsters can not control them 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.270
 That's why I'd rather be someone like him 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.440
 can fly so knew 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.770
 when I wanted to be able to fly in completely 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.120
 easy 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.729
 and maybe a little bit stronger 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.009
 its as a mortal one million 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.870
 euro or 500 qaboos if I mean 730 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.250
 then I would keep one 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.509
 million euros not too much more 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.860
 community over 500 cash registers always 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.780
 any idiot doing something we like 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.190
 I know not the situation of 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.570
 hannover what do i say to that is just 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.979
 shit the last player we can 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.020
 to tear out a few more, I hope so 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.070
 very much that we can do that, that we 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.139
 here somehow actually the 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.910
 It would have been class preservation and that 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.949
 hamburg from steep sections relegation 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.479
 paderborn also descends directly that would be 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.580
 quite good which team otherwise wolfsburg 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.660
 I really like it because I'm there and im 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.039
 band to have and because the team 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.570
 Generally extremely cool football plays 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.190
 Do not follow so far the club before 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.750
 objects and otherwise the first fc 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.250
 cologne for friends and so on and so on 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.509
 My favorite food is pizza 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.620
 and that was it from this episode though 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.180
 let yourself thumb up there 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.380
 write in the commentary with the 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.669
 play and we'll see each other 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.479
 next time again six points from the 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.280
 first episode is a good one 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.940
 yield or wonder until then 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.940
 still pure skin
