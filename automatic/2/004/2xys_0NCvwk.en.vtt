00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.080
 we are in grid autosport and we are going to 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.269
 do this little experiment with 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.160
 steering wheel cameras and pedals so that 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.950
 you see a bit how a game is handled 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.460
 so little simulator with a steering wheel 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.670
 thought for simulators we are in the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.700
 mountain circuit panorama with the pagani 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.700
 huayra 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.730
 a beast that reaches about seals and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.180
 350 but surely the passes we go 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.740
 it seems to me that yes no 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 and let's see if we can give a couple of 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.590
 you can see those differences 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.489
 evident in steering wheel control 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.489
 much more abrupt movements 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.350
 and keep in mind that I'm going to be very slow 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:55.240
 europe the first time he handled this 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.310
 car on this spectacular circuit 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.390
 imagine that someone remembered from 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.390
 project for example 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 the issue of trying to do against 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.360
 flyers and that does not have any kind of 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.360
 sense 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.060
 there was a failure there was a piece of the car 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.060
 there in the middle of the track 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.040
 do not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.450
 and here another good one I do not understand was a 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.450
 blue stub in my car is not blue 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.240
 not rapa this has not recorded me like me 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 wanted to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 the truth is that I love this circuit not 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.729
 is that it is very nice in this grid 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.970
 autosport or I like more in projecting 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.280
 the truth rather cooler 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.390
 well this reaches 350 we're going 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.390
 leftovers and destroys them 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.090
 and what I said what I liked most about 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.380
 this grid doctor sport compared to the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.690
 previous is that it really needs 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.280
 brake you can not enter by skidding 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.240
 beast in all the curves at least not 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.240
 with most cars 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.940
 and it's not a pretty experience 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 curious 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.040
 I'm going very slowly for sure but 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.319
 hear good and I told myself 20 times 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.110
 I find pretty arcades 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.910
 complicated 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.490
 and it is also difficult not to change the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.220
 arcade simulator chip you use the same 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.970
 car the same circuit is complicated not 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.800
 it is quite difficult 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.800
 keep in mind that or so that 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.460
 cars are not controlled anywhere near 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.460
 a similar way 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.720
 like that acceptable 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.709
 but I already tell you it 's a very game 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.750
 fun to me is entertaining me 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.980
 a lot and after my first 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.100
 impressions frankly do not tell me 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.410
 I expected 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.210
 and it 's a playable game with steering wheel is 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.330
 designed for command is worth but is playable 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.980
 with steering wheel or good god clear when 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.080
 you start to master that must be a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.990
 joy to go and skidding beast 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.360
 these walls now I can assure you that 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:17.660
 no that is not there is not within my reach 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.000
 for the moment or ole has said it is that 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.690
 to master that must be a pass I do 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.690
 I'm lucky 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.220
 I do not get in there the second skid 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220
 thats weird 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.090
 let's try to make a third 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.650
 back are good workouts because 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.020
 What I wanted was to show a little bit 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 how he behaved at the wheel not with a 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.650
 I play like that, nothing more 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.170
 more brutal stafford is lovely 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.409
 you can slow down much later this does not 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.409
 is project cars or agreed to cut 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.239
 and I do not know I have the feeling that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.030
 really the game is not intended for 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.280
 skid to the level of gaining time that I 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.129
 gives the feeling that with at least the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.799
 Most cars are better not to skid or 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.180
 skid what's right happens as in project 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.400
 I guess it's a game that really 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.259
 let's say it awards you at the point level 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.389
 so to speak that you skid but 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:28.810
 it really is better to go without skidding 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:33.490
 it's faster I do not know maybe if I master it 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.639
 He changed his mind but it was a pity that I left 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.830
 but it gives me that feeling that 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.599
 It seems better not to skid at the level of going 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.580
 faster than if it's logical, let's say 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.280
 talking about a simulator this is not a 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.170
 simulator 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.630
 and you know that it has always been characterized 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.520
 for being a game that really level 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.169
 after 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.249
 It has a great importance in the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.019
 development of the tests 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.549
 what he has said is to start doing that 

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:03.549
 closest enjoyment 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.930
 now yes yes now yes yes I have gone 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.930
 very very private there 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.789
 very flip good, I'm going to finish 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.660
 this third and disappointing return to 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.930
 see if I enter now I do not rapa 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.850
 not me as I rapa second 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.900
 it's true that I do not know how to skid but good 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.900
 already tried 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.720
 I said it, I am a lover of the 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.580
 simulators but 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.760
 in this game I'm having a lot of fun 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.760
 all right 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.310
 wheel lock that turn more bad 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.530
 after how well in quotation marks that 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.480
 had done the first two in this 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.370
 third I'm 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.370
 passing three towns of the last bend 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.940
 there he was owner 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.830
 there's the drift theme in 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.090
 simulators is not something that 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.710
 I really do not like it 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.720
 amazing people who do I want to 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.060
 say it has a brutal merit it seems to me 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.190
 we are amazing to see that typical video of 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.050
 a circuit of a mountain with the 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.660
 cars is continuously recording we're going 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.130
 you need to have a brutal expertise but 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.900
 it's something that I personally do not 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.789
 it attracts a lot of attention although good 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.430
 this autosport grid looks like 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.800
 allows enough types of gameplay on 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.240
 who wants to do show careers what 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.580
 can do recording all the time but 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.650
 equally if you are looking for an arcade to go what 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.479
 quickest possible because I think that this 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.259
 hungary autosport 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:50.020
 let's say meet well over gentlemen 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.020
 we'll see later bye bye
