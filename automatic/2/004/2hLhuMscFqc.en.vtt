looking at the field the last few days
the<00:03:59.610> corn<00:03:59.879> looks<00:04:00.060> good<00:04:00.390> if<00:04:00.660> they<00:04:00.780> can<00:04:00.989> get<00:04:01.140> it

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the corn looks good if they can get it

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.830 
the corn looks good if they can get it
to<00:04:01.290> dry<00:04:01.590> down<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.220> get<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.970> harvested<00:04:03.540> it'll

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
to dry down and get it harvested it'll

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.390 
to dry down and get it harvested it'll
be<00:04:03.930> interesting<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.470> see<00:04:04.590> what<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> yields

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
be interesting to see what the yields

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.059 
be interesting to see what the yields
are<00:04:06.230> looks<00:04:07.230> like<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.530> deals<00:04:07.680> are<00:04:07.799> gonna<00:04:07.920> be<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
are looks like the deals are gonna be a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.119 
are looks like the deals are gonna be a
little<00:04:08.250> bit<00:04:08.370> higher<00:04:08.660> than<00:04:09.660> last<00:04:09.840> year<00:04:10.170> these

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
little bit higher than last year these

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.940 
little bit higher than last year these
guys<00:04:11.510> have<00:04:12.510> done<00:04:12.540> some<00:04:13.170> things<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.769> they

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
guys have done some things that they

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.800 
guys have done some things that they
their<00:04:14.610> practices<00:04:15.209> they've<00:04:15.450> done<00:04:15.630> them<00:04:15.780> for

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
their practices they've done them for

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.460 
their practices they've done them for
years

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
years

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.909 
years
and<00:04:17.000> it's<00:04:18.000> hard<00:04:18.209> for<00:04:18.269> them<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.630> change<00:04:19.019> and

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
and it's hard for them to change and

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.560 
and it's hard for them to change and
then<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.160> think<00:04:20.430> that's<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.150> goes<00:04:21.359> with

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
then I think that's that goes with

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.840 
then I think that's that goes with
anything<00:04:22.049> but<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.800> lot<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.040> these<00:04:23.190> guys<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.520> think

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
anything but a lot of these guys I think

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.440 
anything but a lot of these guys I think
necessity<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.850> know<00:04:27.000> just<00:04:27.300> seeing

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
necessity and and you know just seeing

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.110 
necessity and and you know just seeing
their<00:04:27.660> neighbor<00:04:27.979> he's<00:04:28.979> doing<00:04:29.310> some<00:04:29.520> good<00:04:29.700> good

that they won't need to use this the

that they won't need to use this the
water<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.660> most<00:04:42.840> efficient<00:04:43.350> manner<00:04:43.530> that

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
years we've started going quite a few

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.950 
years we've started going quite a few
acres<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:50.010> cotton<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:50.639> it's<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.389> plant<00:04:51.660> that's

not using as much water and they can

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.659 
not using as much water and they can

will respond to a little bit of water at
the<00:05:15.690> right<00:05:15.990> time<00:05:16.440> we'll<00:05:17.430> make<00:05:17.580> an<00:05:17.760> awful<00:05:18.150> lot

we're<00:05:23.010> having<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.520> learn<00:05:23.700> if<00:05:23.940> we're<00:05:24.090> going<00:05:24.240> to

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
we're having to learn if we're going to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.990 
we're having to learn if we're going to
continue<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.620> farm<00:05:25.919> in<00:05:26.130> this<00:05:26.280> area<00:05:26.639> under

we're doing things and we are back here
I've<00:05:33.570> gone<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.289> using<00:05:34.700> stripped<00:05:35.700> tillage<00:05:36.229> we

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
I've gone to using stripped tillage we

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.279 
I've gone to using stripped tillage we
don't<00:05:37.530> till<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.550> ground<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:39.360> rip<00:05:39.599> it<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:39.870> we

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
don't till the ground and rip it like we

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.260 
don't till the ground and rip it like we
used<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:41.150> use

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
used to use

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.900 
used to use
to<00:05:42.420> plow<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.470> ground<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.040> many<00:05:44.220> times<00:05:44.520> yeah<00:05:44.790> I

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
to plow the ground so many times yeah I

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.090 
to plow the ground so many times yeah I
mean<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.210> would<00:05:45.330> look<00:05:45.450> like<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:45.930> garden<00:05:46.290> with

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
mean it would look like a garden with

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.740 
mean it would look like a garden with
strip<00:05:47.400> tillage<00:05:47.820> we<00:05:48.030> leave<00:05:48.210> an<00:05:48.360> awful<00:05:48.630> lot<00:05:48.720> of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
strip tillage we leave an awful lot of

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.530 
strip tillage we leave an awful lot of
organic<00:05:49.320> matter<00:05:49.530> on<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.950> ground<00:05:50.220> which<00:05:51.150> helps

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
organic matter on the ground which helps

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.370 
organic matter on the ground which helps
keep<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.840> water<00:05:52.110> from<00:05:52.410> running<00:05:52.590> off<00:05:52.950> with

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
keep the water from running off with

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.060 
keep the water from running off with
yeah<00:05:55.380> there's<00:05:55.620> still<00:05:55.830> some<00:05:56.010> moisture<00:05:56.160> in<00:05:56.550> it
