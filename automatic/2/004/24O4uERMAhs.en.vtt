00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.799
 always greet you all from the fans 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 this assist you see is the tab 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.759
 mother of a samsung galaxy version s 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 iii this part that I framed you and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.990
 where it attaches for charging then 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 the usb port 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 the removed usb port here it is that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 there was a charging problem due to the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 fact that perhaps in inserting the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.289
 micro usb charging connector have 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.320
 one of the internal parts was broken 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:40.620
 with the student microscope came from 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.200
 we want that in 24 hours 24 48 hours but 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.550
 however in 24 hours we were doing the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.989
 replacement 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.110
 we then removed the part 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 old so for knowledge only there 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.680
 I say I will not show you the whole 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 procedure this time with hot air 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
 the whole part must be taken away 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.989
 old will take a long time because it is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.210
 very resistant then you will put some 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.060
 ante flow as usual for 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 especially to reconstruct this is here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.250
 are the tracks of the door contacts 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.130
 usb but also the sides where it is supported 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.060
 the usb connector and this and that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 new 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.640
 as original here we will put it that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.890
 we will save it first, but we must 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.810
 prepare everything so instead want 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 an ad hoc welder even then will we 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.820
 he wants the right tip I've already explained 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.340
 to make erarial center welds 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.280
 I am 21 in this point that is here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.950
 blunt and flat it takes some time 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 little pond because you should 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.259
 use the tin rather than anything else 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 it is already present on the motherboard and then 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 we are going to redo the tracks, here they are 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 see no they are different but only some 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.780
 others are used are perhaps so 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.090
 says to lose the filing cloth do not have 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.149
 a specific function 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.209
 so after having prepared this here 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.330
 then it will be enough to make another hot weld 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.850
 with new net 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.430
 this is the procedure and we will have the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.380
 restore this usb port 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.540
 our client is not even the name 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.630
 now what was the name of the di 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.600
 name this person then that yes 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.220
 he calls the maurizio yes but the signor maurizio 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.130
 brought me it seems to me that he has the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.040
 desire and the wife therefore not to put 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.860
 well the plug refill because for 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.780
 break it unless the warning was 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.480
 attacked I took a blow because I can 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.000
 garden caring for a child someone 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.060
 in short yes then if one goes research 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.760
 causes always something to be found at 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.310
 a customer with bard for example glass 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.990
 broke then told us that a grandchild 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.310
 he used it as a stool he sat down 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.000
 over it 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.720
 certainly not nice but it can happen no 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.290
 are the things of life as a would say 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.630
 singer 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.790
 so then always it seems the tracks yes 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.840
 put the new connector on and I will do 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.750
 see the final result or how 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.550
 it is soldered to hot air 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.590
 space is underneath because there is nothing 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.200
 therefore we will not give from below so remains 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.720
 very firm the important thing is to center vi 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.450
 I repeat all these tracks some later 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.310
 correspond to all these little teeth 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.920
 I'll show you this connector 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.470
 for those who are all they must do well 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.030
 contact to have it restored 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.650
 USB port functionality 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.230
 I'll see you soon and show you how I got 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.930
 did I finish the welding and then 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 possibly also access to which goes into 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.410
 ignition is that charging here it is 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.580
 new welded connector we approach 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.580
 to make it look better 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.269
 here it is, I'm put in place 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.440
 of the other little goes out as you see 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.720
 it must be welded here on all four sides 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.489
 and then all these little teeth on their own 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.160
 tracks of another made to divide it 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.180
 I show the tracks we have 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.750
 had to weld with which all these 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.030
 they are many 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.700
 you see it is not some track 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.190
 so can say symbola are different 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.690
 the central ones are more important then 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.160
 there are also the side ones but also 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.760
 in short, we must not neglect it 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.550
 samsung s3 usb battery collector with 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.220
 which is recharged and also with which one 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.050
 compare data with the computer 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.740
 then you update on the phone on 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.740
 data exchange 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.950
 the client recently told us that 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.000
 this is a very simple thing that 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.740
 we ask too much 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.470
 well if it's very simple I don't think so 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.690
 precisely because I have tried it and 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.970
 and it was the most complex welding ed 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.270
 he had to do so I don't think so 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.340
 not at all simple that first of all for 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.000
 remove the old connector it takes 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.580
 a life because it is welded very well 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.040
 so you have to preheat the card 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.990
 mother and then with a balance to pull it off 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.650
 so it takes two balances on Monday 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.050
 pole but nole 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.510
 and then you have to re-weld well with 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.970
 specifies all these teeth to them 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.370
 otherwise the connector has 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.250
 shot I also show on the other 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.479
 to him again here it is this 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.100
 motherboard usb connector not 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.500
 make it home this is calling me because 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.320
 call out of hours and not only must 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.100
 allowing we need gods too 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.790
 our spaces 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.120
 if then we will call it otherwise the 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.700
 other room genuinely not fitting room 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.970
 I stand the people who insist when 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:03.490
 they must not insist then connector 3 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.930
 samsung s3 connector three do not know that 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.450
 if 3 with itself for usb 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.130
 we paid it, I'll show you the 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.130
 result should now load you 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.140
 exchange here we are with our s3 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.419
 of the Mr. maurizio we have 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.510
 USB connector soldered 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.290
 here it is now we will do the test if it goes 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.930
 all right 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.349
 or if this USB connector that 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.550
 we welded it performs its function 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:29.800
 tension is not an operation at all 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.570
 simple at least for now is the most 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.390
 difficult that i am with 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.419
 compared we see the result not 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.250
 I still turned it on let's see a little bit 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.930
 first major ignition you should 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.430
 in fact turn here you see it is you 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.890
 switched on 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:50.620
 let's see if everything seems to work 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:54.070
 it's round 3 so there was no 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.610
 possibility to top up we have a 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.710
 handy in charging cable 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:05.169
 we see a little if the battery or in 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.520
 charge there is a baby we remove colleague to 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:11.740
 charger ok 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:15.940
 let's connect our other degree so it is 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.860
 a bit harsh is new but here we see it is 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:22.419
 in office as you can expect 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.580
 let's see if you see 15 percent 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.770
 the new connector so now for 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.620
 come in I had to do a little strength but 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.360
 however here it is 15 percent is in 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.099
 charge I think the operation is 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.500
 the carroccio this screensaver succeeded 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:37.150
 that changes the photos 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.020
 the operation seems to me to be successful we see 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:43.629
 if I can remove even silent yes 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.550
 the market the silent so we have 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:50.229
 completed the repair of 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:54.099
 this samsung galaxy s3 24 48 hours cost 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:55.900
 of the operation 85 euro welding a lot 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:58.180
 difficult at least for me 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.090
 the one with which I was confronted 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.949
 with more difficulty 

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.949
 thanks to all of you from iphone assist
