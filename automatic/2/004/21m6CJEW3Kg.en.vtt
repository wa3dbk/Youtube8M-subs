00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
Gus gives adolescents a lot of credit

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.370 
Gus gives adolescents a lot of credit
for<00:01:53.630> their<00:01:53.930> complexity<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:56.360> kind<00:01:57.259> of

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
for their complexity and and the kind of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.350 
for their complexity and and the kind of
emotional<00:01:58.009> turbulence<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:59.000> they<00:01:59.300> are

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
emotional turbulence that they are

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.660 
emotional turbulence that they are
experiencing<00:02:00.290> these<00:02:00.590> films<00:02:00.890> never<00:02:01.130> undermine

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
experiencing these films never undermine

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.060 
experiencing these films never undermine
like<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.210> teenage<00:02:02.540> experience<00:02:03.259> which<00:02:03.950> i

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
like the teenage experience which i

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.740 
like the teenage experience which i
think<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.400> really<00:02:04.759> great<00:02:04.970> because<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.630> many

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
think is really great because so many

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.810 
think is really great because so many
teen<00:02:06.080> films<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.619> felt<00:02:06.890> like<00:02:07.130> we're<00:02:07.580> so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
teen films I felt like we're so

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.419 
teen films I felt like we're so
difficult<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.630> identify<00:02:09.200> with<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:10.280> mean

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
difficult to identify with and I mean

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.070 
difficult to identify with and I mean
they're<00:02:10.580> very<00:02:10.850> attractive<00:02:11.180> because<00:02:11.780> they're

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
they're very attractive because they're

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.150 
they're very attractive because they're
kind<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.950> think<00:02:13.910> not<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.200> common

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
kind of like I think not a common

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160 
kind of like I think not a common
experience<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> lot<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.300> teen<00:02:17.480> films<00:02:17.930> but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
experience like a lot of teen films but

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.990 
experience like a lot of teen films but
but<00:02:18.650> there's<00:02:18.800> something<00:02:19.010> about<00:02:19.040> Gus's<00:02:19.610> movies

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
but there's something about Gus's movies

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.720 
but there's something about Gus's movies
that<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.239> really<00:02:20.690> sort<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.730> sensitivity

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
that I really sort of have a sensitivity

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.940 
that I really sort of have a sensitivity
to<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:22.970> time<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.720> people's<00:02:24.080> lives<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.650> love

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
to that time in people's lives I love

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550 
to that time in people's lives I love
the<00:02:25.070> fact<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.370> there's<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:26.019> silent<00:02:27.019> acting

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the fact that there's this silent acting

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.600 
the fact that there's this silent acting
like<00:02:27.680> he<00:02:27.830> kind<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.070> go<00:02:28.190> through<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.459> whole

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
like he kind of go through the whole

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.970 
like he kind of go through the whole
script<00:02:29.030> does<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> first<00:02:30.830> time

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
script does that is that the first time

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
script does that is that the first time
you've<00:02:31.160> ever<00:02:31.220> experienced<00:02:31.730> something<00:02:31.760> like

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
you've ever experienced something like

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.910 
you've ever experienced something like
that<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.600> how<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.200> kind<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.500> helped<00:02:33.800> you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
that and how is that kind of helped you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.710 
that and how is that kind of helped you
with<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.580> progression<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.060> how<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.239> kind<00:02:35.600> of

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
with the progression of how you kind of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.259 
with the progression of how you kind of
films<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.160> mean<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.610> silent<00:02:38.030> tape

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
films do you mean like the silent tape

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.420 
films do you mean like the silent tape
yeah<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.780> sound<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.050> takes<00:02:39.260> yeah<00:02:39.560> yeah<00:02:40.100> we<00:02:40.250> do

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
yeah the sound it takes yeah yeah we do

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.270 
yeah the sound it takes yeah yeah we do
a<00:02:40.459> silent<00:02:40.760> take<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.299> every<00:02:41.600> setup<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.950> that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
a silent take for every setup and that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.850 
a silent take for every setup and that
was<00:02:43.430> great<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:43.910> often<00:02:44.410> we'd<00:02:45.410> do<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> silent

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
was great like often we'd do a silent

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.259 
was great like often we'd do a silent
taking<00:02:46.430> oh<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.910> get<00:02:47.329> it<00:02:47.360> now<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.049> clicks

taking oh I get it now I like it clicks

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.400 
taking oh I get it now I like it clicks
just<00:02:50.269> because<00:02:50.600> there's<00:02:51.049> something<00:02:51.260> about

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
just because there's something about

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.440
