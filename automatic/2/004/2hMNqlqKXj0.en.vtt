00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.489
 the video hello everyone today I bring you one 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.620
 small compilation of ebooks that I 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.719
 have been going on butterfield online 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.129
 both in a campaign mode and mode 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.809
 multiplayer here was mode 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.090
 multiplayer and something very curious happened to me 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.809
 it seems that they had just killed me and 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.480
 when I left when he reappeared when 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.130
 reappeared in a particular player 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.170
 appears just below the map as 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.690
 you are seeing is to say that we are in the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.939
 map of everglades that just right 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.080
 they are like lakes and such for some 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.990
 swamps rather said 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.460
 for people who do not know and good and like 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.800
 You see, I look like I'm swimming 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.870
 under the map a pretty thing 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.940
 curious to say that one of these books does not 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.790
 they have no explanation there is no 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.170
 I was just invited to the car duty but 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.970
 good that has no application 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.650
 they just happen because they have to 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.410
 pass and points are already simple mistakes 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.990
 of the game is already I do not know why it happened 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.120
 this I do not know how to explain it but there as 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.730
 you see people walk over there not 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.360
 just below, as if there were 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.640
 water there and I'm like swimming then what 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.560
 I tried again but it was impossible 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.270
 I do not know how happened by chance that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.670
 As you can see, it's just something in 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.320
 that would be below the ground and nothing 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.180
 quite curious just in that but 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 of no use here we are in the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.540
 campaign mode that as you can see here there is a 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.410
 guy who has been hooked 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.330
 just one of the enemies has been 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.979
 got hooked on that furniture happened 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
 something very curious is a scene in which 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.520
 you enter a room there are some 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.080
 guys playing cards and such and 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.670
 knock and knock open the door of the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.760
 true spin that you have to kill them 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.500
 I did not all kill them all but one of 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 they in particular started to get hooked 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.459
 here in this piece of furniture began to rise say 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.170
 that he had his head almost in the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.510
 ceiling of the room and bang and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.830
 porrazo pump stays hooked it 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.900
 It was still there, it did not give me time 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.600
 killing him is worth it as you see was the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.190
 supposed partner not of the campaign the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.750
 Room is shattered but that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.489
 enemy is not dead that enemy is 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.590
 was there pillad and ximo I do not know why 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.120
 also in campaign mode something happened to me 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.340
 very curious after a while I gave myself 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.099
 mind that the pencil 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.930
 It is missing a piece and as you see it is missing 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.610
 a piece to the gun but could 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.980
 shoot well and everything seems very 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.810
 curious at first I even doubted if it was 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.599
 something of the game but but it was not a 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.360
 error I do not know what happened to you as you can see 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.640
 it was as wanted and not missing a piece 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.400
 in the top part not the part that is 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.840
 moves from the gun not quite curious 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.150
 now just when I arrived here 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.799
 continue this book was taken away from me and now 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.410
 I had the normal gun well when 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.870
 when I went to stop that player is the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.340
 enemy forgiveness here as you see we are a 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.810
 knot in another of the multiplayer maps to 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.660
 that I was when only one server I 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.670
 alone and good is studied teach some more 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.099
 or less in places where you see things 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.799
 a little strange as well as wal break 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.230
 some wordpress through walls and 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.480
 so good that in a video more 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.819
 go ahead I will teach the points 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.129
 of each site in case someone 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.440
 wants to go a bit then to investigate or 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.879
 change a little what you want wrong here 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.940
 it was simply a small recovery 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.739
 of the weird things that I've been seeing 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.930
 but yes that for example things like this 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.700
 it happened to me they happened to me by chance 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.459
 but then I got 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.709
 to the site and do it like here just 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.180
 also worth and some more sites but 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.620
 especially those from the beginning that 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.319
 reappear under the map and that's not 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.230
 I can, I do not have an explanation of how 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.599
 it's worth just step and you're done and 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.000
 there are some strategic sites like 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.000
 this one and another one that yes that already 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.300
 I say in another video already as concreting 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.680
 what map is and where exactly already 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.600
 I will show more or less where these are 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.100
 sites that good that do not stop being 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600
 mistakes and well that's why they were in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.739
 this video so I do not expect anything that you 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.510
 I liked it if you liked to vote 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.830
 meters and favorites and see you in the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.830
 next video greetings to all 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.040
 and later
