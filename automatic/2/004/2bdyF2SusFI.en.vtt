00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.290
 to 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.290
 ah 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.670
 welcome to such legends and video games 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.200
 they remind me of chapters like the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.010
 origin of sun and with the connection of my 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.660
 lifetime 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.610
 cultural references in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.630
 video games are frequent even more so if the 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.580
 game comes from japan 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 the creators of jewelry like katamari 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.330
 damacy fuck is a game where you make a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 ball with the things that you are collecting from 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.869
 soil could only leave japan this 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 week we'll see the connotations 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.180
 Cultural of five animal characters 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.500
 crossing another day and those that are left 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.330
 let's start with the captain who is the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.550
 first character we know the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.530
 Captain capable of a tense in Japanese 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 it looks like a turtle but certain 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.129
 represents a layer a creature 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
 mythological that lives in rivers and kidnaps 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 children in their spare time in the version 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.190
 of 3ds the captain makes many 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 references to cucumbers this is because 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 according to Japanese mythology so that a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.640
 layer give you example you have to give it a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.640
 cucumber 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
 just get to the station we 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.440
 we find with these I there are those who leave 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.940
 in Japanese according to iwata clear in a 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.770
 interview this character is a monkey 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.370
 inspired by the Japanese monkey song 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.250
 palanquin carriers 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.690
 thom not so cliché in Japanese is maybe 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.940
 the character that we talk to the most 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.830
 Throughout the game is a raccoon 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.960
 you can see in Japanese 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.460
 Repeat a pattern with the names on the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.620
 Japanese culture the raccoons are 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.970
 represented with huge experts and 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.740
 although it may seem that they represent 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.450
 fertility is actually a symbol of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.450
 economy and good luck with business 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.270
 ladino to the honest sound cliché in 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.400
 Japanese is a fox in the game and in the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.520
 mythology are painted as liars 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.450
 and naughty and even evil cheaters 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.190
 some of its powers are the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.290
 metamorphosis usually in women 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.240
 attractive and the power to transform 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.790
 useless objects like branches and leaves in 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.320
 money this can be a reference to 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.240
 fact that when we get an object in 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.130
 the inventory is in the form of a sheet and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.820
 leaving it in the house becomes the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.820
 furniture in question 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.690
 finally the turn of the turns comes 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 it is the most macabre reference in the game 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.950
 in Japan the turns called hand equal 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.330
 They are funerary sculptures made of 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.040
 terracotta that in previous times 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.020
 buried in the rituals after the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.820
 death of someone this makes you think that 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.410
 our character is desecrating tombs 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.410
 while searching for treasures on the ground 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.340
 that has been all for today if it has 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.240
