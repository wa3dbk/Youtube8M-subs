the<00:00:44.910> effect<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.690> assuming<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.649> hedge<00:00:46.950> gets

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the effect I'm assuming when hedge gets

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.410 
the effect I'm assuming when hedge gets
a<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:47.789> prevalent<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.450> css3<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.649> html5

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
a bit more prevalent and css3 and html5

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
a bit more prevalent and css3 and html5
is<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.660> widely<00:00:51.870> adopted<00:00:52.199> than<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
is more widely adopted than the this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
is more widely adopted than the this
effect<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.300> work<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> look<00:00:55.860> into

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
effect will work but I have to look into

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.880 
effect will work but I have to look into
a<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.340> more<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.940> anyway<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.350> basic<00:00:58.680> premise

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
a bit more and anyway the basic premise

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.779 
a bit more and anyway the basic premise
is<00:00:59.280> if<00:01:00.180> you've<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.920> div<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> night<00:01:02.550> sorry

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
is if you've got a div or a night sorry

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.170 
is if you've got a div or a night sorry

didn't work a couple of minutes ago
that's<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.259> weird<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:05.299> shows<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:06.420> only

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that's really weird just shows I'm only

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
that's really weird just shows I'm only
human<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.869> guess<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.649> let's<00:02:07.829> try<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> getting

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
human I guess so let's try that getting

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
human I guess so let's try that getting
chrome<00:02:08.929> just<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> decide<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.349> only

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
chrome just going to decide this only

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.830 
chrome just going to decide this only
what<00:02:10.800> no<00:02:10.920> chrome<00:02:11.190> does<00:02:11.459> not<00:02:11.610> work<00:02:11.819> okay

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
what no chrome does not work okay

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.030 
what no chrome does not work okay
and<00:02:13.349> try<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:14.190> more<00:02:14.340> time<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.730> firefox<00:02:16.040> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and try one more time in firefox and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.130 
and try one more time in firefox and
firefox<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.640> does<00:02:17.819> work<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.269> jittery<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.019> it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
firefox it does work it's jittery but it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.680 
firefox it does work it's jittery but it
does<00:02:19.290> work<00:02:20.030> let's<00:02:21.030> make<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> animation<00:02:21.629> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
does work let's make the animation a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.420 
does work let's make the animation a
little<00:02:21.870> bit<00:02:21.989> longer<00:02:22.910> set<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> three<00:02:25.430> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
little bit longer set up to three and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.289 
little bit longer set up to three and
let's<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.209> if<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:29.299> moving

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
let's see if we can have it moving

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.990 
let's see if we can have it moving
around<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:31.019> we'll<00:02:31.170> set<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.860> keyframe<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
around so we'll set the keyframe for the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.670 
around so we'll set the keyframe for the
location<00:02:33.330> at<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.110> start<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:36.680> 23

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
location at the start and then 23

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.009 
location at the start and then 23
seconds<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.459> we'll<00:02:38.610> set<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.940> location<00:02:39.090> x

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
seconds in and we'll set the location x

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.789 
seconds in and we'll set the location x
value<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.910> well<00:02:41.910> how<00:02:42.030> about<00:02:42.060> there<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
value up to well how about there and

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.740 
value up to well how about there and
save<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:45.480> seeing<00:02:45.630> what

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
save that out just seeing what

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.039 
save that out just seeing what
animations<00:02:46.200> will<00:02:46.349> work<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:46.739> an<00:02:46.829> iphone<00:02:48.049> open

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
animations will work with an iphone open

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.960 
animations will work with an iphone open
that<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.349> safari<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.370> move<00:02:53.519> obviously

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
that up in safari and the move obviously

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.050 
that up in safari and the move obviously
