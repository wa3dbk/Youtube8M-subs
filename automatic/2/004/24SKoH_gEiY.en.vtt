I'm doing it I've just loosened up at
the<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:06.240> he<00:01:06.720> runs<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:06.990> underneath<00:01:07.560> not

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the back he runs right underneath not

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.710

got the panels off so it's definitely

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
got the panels off so it's definitely
worth<00:01:11.250> replacing<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.299> seven<00:01:12.689> or

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
worth replacing these for about seven or

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
worth replacing these for about seven or

obviously<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:13.200> you're<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.680> taking<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
obviously if you're just taking the the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.009 
obviously if you're just taking the the
back<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.239> one<00:03:15.420> job<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.780> would<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:15.989> a

back to be so that one job it would be a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.320 
back to be so that one job it would be a
bit<00:03:16.170> time-consuming<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> first

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
bit time-consuming so that's the first

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.190 
bit time-consuming so that's the first
one<00:03:18.540> off<00:03:18.720> anyway

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
one off anyway

you can see the big silver bracket here

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.560 
you can see the big silver bracket here
wanted<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.519> go<00:03:50.700> behind<00:03:51.000> there<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:51.269> don't

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
wanted to go behind there so don't

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
pitch slides about we just pop it to the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.860 
pitch slides about we just pop it to the
end<00:04:01.320> then<00:04:01.440> pop<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.799> underneath<00:04:02.420> or<00:04:03.420> set<00:04:03.750> in

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
end then pop it underneath or set in

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.920 

just<00:04:24.940> slide<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.720> can<00:04:25.900> see<00:04:26.110> there<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:27.190> then

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
case he just fits in this plastic sleeve

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.650 
case he just fits in this plastic sleeve
there<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:33.850> gives<00:04:34.030> us<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.180> starting

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
there so that gives us a starting

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.790 
there so that gives us a starting
program<00:04:34.960> I've<00:04:35.020> got<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:35.260> through<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> back

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
program I've got this through the back

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.860 
program I've got this through the back
let<00:04:36.460> me<00:04:36.520> just<00:04:36.669> take<00:04:36.820> this<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.240> yes<00:04:37.480> pass

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
let me just take this on the yes pass

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.210 
let me just take this on the yes pass
out<00:04:38.110> at<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.320> bank<00:04:38.500> as<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:39.010> from

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
out at the bank as you can see from

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.400 
out at the bank as you can see from
there<00:04:39.460> come<00:04:40.330> on<00:04:40.419> do<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.720> salmon<00:04:40.930> bag<00:04:41.200> and

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
there come on do the salmon bag and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:55.740 
there come on do the salmon bag and
thread<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.800> back<00:04:42.010> onto<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.400> chassis<00:04:54.750> I've

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
thread this back onto the chassis I've

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.870 
thread this back onto the chassis I've
got<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.380> underneath<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.430> chassis<00:04:57.700> as

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
got that just underneath this chassis as

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.420 
got that just underneath this chassis as
you<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.120> see<00:04:58.330> here<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.830> also<00:04:59.950> here

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
you can see here and also here

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.219 
you can see here and also here
notably<00:05:01.000> off<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.419> just<00:05:01.450> flipped<00:05:01.840> in<00:05:02.020> here

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
notably off it just flipped in here

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.990 
notably off it just flipped in here
behind<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:03.220> little<00:05:03.490> bracket<00:05:03.700> as<00:05:03.970> well

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
behind this this little bracket as well

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.330 
behind this this little bracket as well
so<00:05:04.990> I've<00:05:05.050> popped<00:05:05.229> up<00:05:05.410> back<00:05:05.560> down<00:05:05.620> net<00:05:06.070> seems

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
so I've popped up back down net seems

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.040 
so I've popped up back down net seems
like<00:05:06.490> a<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.850> sensible<00:05:07.360> place<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.690> put<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:07.960> long

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
like a a sensible place to put as long

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.420 
like a a sensible place to put as long
as<00:05:08.169> it's<00:05:08.290> not<00:05:08.410> trapped<00:05:08.710> between<00:05:08.800> these<00:05:09.100> screws

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
as it's not trapped between these screws

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.240 
as it's not trapped between these screws
it<00:05:10.210> should<00:05:10.389> be<00:05:10.570> fine<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.770> I've<00:05:11.830> actually<00:05:11.950> made

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
it should be fine so I've actually made

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.460 
it should be fine so I've actually made
sure<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:13.240> actually<00:05:13.900> runs<00:05:14.139> underneath

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
sure that this actually runs underneath

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.440 
sure that this actually runs underneath
the<00:05:14.620> bottom<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.490> shaft<00:05:15.729> just<00:05:16.090> this

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
the bottom of the shaft just this

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.300 
the bottom of the shaft just this
chassis<00:05:16.810> here<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:17.260> an<00:05:17.380> editor<00:05:17.830> on<00:05:17.950> the<00:05:18.100> tree

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
chassis here just an editor on the tree

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.780 
chassis here just an editor on the tree
so<00:05:18.760> in<00:05:18.850> between<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.330> two<00:05:19.540> not<00:05:20.169> over<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.470> top

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
so in between the two not over the top

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.400 
so in between the two not over the top
it<00:05:21.790> runs<00:05:22.450> right<00:05:22.600> along<00:05:22.750> here<00:05:22.930> just<00:05:22.990> missing

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
it runs right along here just missing

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.450 
it runs right along here just missing
the<00:05:23.500> stand<00:05:23.770> as<00:05:23.919> well<00:05:24.010> you<00:05:24.130> don't<00:05:24.220> want<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
the stand as well you don't want it

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.520 
the stand as well you don't want it
anywhere<00:05:24.700> in<00:05:24.940> between<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.389> stand<00:05:25.690> otherwise

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
anywhere in between the stand otherwise

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.600 
anywhere in between the stand otherwise
would<00:05:26.710> initially<00:05:27.040> stand<00:05:27.280> up<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.520> down

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
would initially stand up and down

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.860 
would initially stand up and down
obviously<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.000> brick<00:05:28.180> cables<00:05:28.600> he's<00:05:28.720> not

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
obviously the brick cables he's not

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.020 
obviously the brick cables he's not
tidal<00:05:29.380> clips<00:05:29.620> on<00:05:29.770> there<00:05:29.919> correctly<00:05:30.340> you're

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
tidal clips on there correctly you're

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.490 
tidal clips on there correctly you're
gonna<00:05:31.120> have<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.300> problem<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.200> last<00:05:32.320> thing

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
gonna have a problem so the last thing

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.100 
gonna have a problem so the last thing
to<00:05:32.560> do<00:05:32.710> there<00:05:33.039> is<00:05:33.310> just<00:05:33.520> push<00:05:33.970> this<00:05:34.120> this<00:05:34.720> cable

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
to do there is just push this this cable

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.570 
to do there is just push this this cable
into<00:05:35.289> back<00:05:35.440> of<00:05:35.590> this<00:05:35.680> groove<00:05:35.919> here<00:05:36.039> just<00:05:36.370> fits

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
into back of this groove here just fits

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.510 
into back of this groove here just fits
in<00:05:36.760> there<00:05:36.970> snugly<00:05:37.450> there's<00:05:38.080> actually<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.520> cover

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
in there snugly there's actually a cover

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.219 
in there snugly there's actually a cover
that<00:05:39.669> will<00:05:40.090> fit<00:05:40.360> it<00:05:40.450> now<00:05:40.600> once<00:05:40.780> I've<00:05:40.960> got<00:05:41.110> this

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
that will fit it now once I've got this

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.880 
that will fit it now once I've got this
on<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:42.190> then<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.760> next<00:05:43.000> thing<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.330> do<00:05:43.450> is<00:05:43.479> just

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
on and then the next thing to do is just

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.740 
on and then the next thing to do is just
pull<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:44.979> back<00:05:45.130> of<00:05:45.280> this<00:05:45.370> cable<00:05:45.850> just<00:05:46.060> threw

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
pull the back of this cable just threw
