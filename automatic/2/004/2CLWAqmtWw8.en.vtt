 explain the functions of mini connect 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.980
 inside the vehicles the first thing that 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.540
 we need is the cable and this cable is 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.970
 included in the mini at the time of 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.460
 purchase and is the interface that allows us 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.130
 connect and have 100% compatibility 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.630
 with the apple computers in this case a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.000
 iphone what we are going to do 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.430
 we have usb output for man 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.079
 it's information and data and that of auxiliary 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.000
 for video and audio do not connect in the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.000
 USB interface that the vehicle has 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.900
 in the center console and on the cable that 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 it connects in 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.170
 in the team 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.290
 so that we make 100% compatible the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.210
 mini function offers an application that 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.010
 It is free of charge inside 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.390
 of what the app store is called 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.750
 mini connected 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.309
 connect the mini have the command 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.500
 establishes the connection with the account that 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.740
 you have created and then it becomes 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.990
 in the applications administrator 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.270
 of your iphone inside what is the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.320
 all vehicle is controlled from the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.650
 shipment and within mini connect we are going to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.900
 have several categories the first is the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.320
 news category in this category 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.590
 we found the rss feeds that 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.830
 can this issue any source of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.610
 information as for example have or 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.890
 mini or good any page that emits 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.840
 news sources in case 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.820
 we are driving good 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 traffic the vehicle has the ability 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.400
 of reading the news another of the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.290
 applications that we have 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.900
 a direct interface with the vehicle 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.150
 extra and they see exactly the first thing that 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.100
 is going to do is a test where he tells me if 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.930
 I bring gasoline outside temperature 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.180
 to avoid risks of skidding by 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.550
 ice if the engine is already at temperature 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.150
 ready to work if it is in mode 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.820
 sport or not and that we are ready to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.430
 run we have additionally 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.920
 connectivity with the main networks 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.480
 social as facebook or twitter and is 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 within this part we can see the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.280
 posts from our friends and even 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.320
 We can post information from 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 according to messages preloaded in 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.280
 our cell phone that have to do with 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.070
 vehicle information for example the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.410
 satellite position and the browser the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.120
 room temperature or the music that you 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.850
 are you listening at that moment in the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 vehicle you will have access to 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120
 images 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.950
 to comments 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.200
 and you can give me an immediate 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.450
 like another of the social networks to the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.700
 that we have access is twitter in which 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.240
 we can see the tweets of the people to the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.240
 what are we following 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.390
 we can have the network function of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.540
 tweet or bookmark the tweet 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.920
 besides seeing the timeline of it 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.629
 other social networks foursquare in the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.969
 that you can check-in at 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.760
 places near you are 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.469
 and good in this case you can do the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.689
 check-in directly from the mini by 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.459
 the places where you are going what 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.280
 interesting of the three social networks 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.260
 is that mini is going to share saying that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.629
 is through mini then everyone goes to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.639
 know that you are using your social network 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.609
 but what are you using it within 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.159
 a mini vehicle the mini function 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.220
 very bad analyzer is a function that 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.989
 seeks to help the environment this 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.930
 application will give us tips or we will 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.419
 help see how friendly it is with the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.579
 environment our management and it is represented 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.260
 in a very funny way with a fish tank and 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.780
 a fish then when we go 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.849
 driving is going to be helping us 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.730
 obviously to the new throw the fish of the 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.860
 fish tank and go collecting points 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.769
 is when we judge enough 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.840
 stars the fish gets happy and starts 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.450
 to jump and spin around indicating that 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.209
 we are quite efficient and friendly 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.459
 with the environment another of the applications 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.000
 that we can have inside the mini 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.640
 connect is mission control in this 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.650
 function the mini talk with us and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.549
 interacts according to the conditions 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.800
 of march and the activators that we are 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.800
 using for example if I game 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.360
 for example if I activate the sport mode 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.160
 finish 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.290
 and so any of the functions that 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.900
 we can have in the vehicle would generate 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.480
 a comment about the car in the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.980
 gameplay as if the modules or 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.140
 the vehicle computers were 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.630
 people and interact with us 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.030
 another application regarding 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.620
 entertainment is dynamics music and in 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.090
 is 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.400
 East West 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.949
 apart we are going to have the 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.680
 ability to create our own track 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:11.449
 musical we started with a musical base 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.460
 quiet and if we start to 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.620
 accelerate to spin to do a handling 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.510
 aggressive we are raising the tone of the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.699
 song and obviously we are creating 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.440
 our own melody as an example 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.270
 Now we 're in a static way 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.270
 I'm going to turn on the directionals 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.129
 and the audio changes from one side to the other that 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.810
 we will also be able to have an effect 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.849
 when we go and we accelerate very hard the 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.499
 audio will go backwards if we accelerate 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.689
 very strong braking is coming 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.999
 go ahead and let's vary treble or 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.710
 serious these tracks you can download 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.590
 directly from the application of 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.210
 free way we also have the 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.110
 possibility of hearing radio on the internet 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.689
 what this application is is basically 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.069
 equal to all radio applications 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.020
 by internet nothing else have the advantage 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.789
 that you can manage it from the 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.949
 screen of your mini choosing the 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.319
 radio station that you like the most in 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.060
 anywhere in the world another of the 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.009
 exclusive features that has mini is 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.680
 the plugin function in which you can 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.599
 Directly send the screen 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.340
 directly to your iphone screen 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.110
 your vehicle having the same 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.969
 image distribution and obviously the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.639
 same distribution of functions that 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.949
 we would have in our mobile device 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.740
 having the facility that if you 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:29.610
 they have many with many songs 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.370
 because we can manage the 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.470
 from here for example 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.139
 in the songs and in the same way 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.470
 you can move quickly and you go to 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:42.780

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.660
 and then you can select the attention 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.600
 that you like having the ranking of the 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:53.210
 song the art image of the record and 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.210
