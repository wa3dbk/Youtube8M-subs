00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 beautiful all guys here orgasms that they are 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 here with a new summer episode 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.950
 potential transfer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 but before starting I wanted to clarify 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.460
 a moment a thing 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 many of you have told me to do how 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.320
 last year that is talking about the players 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.770
 and put the prediction of the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 statistics of the players who will be in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.240
 fifa 16 but I won't do it until when 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.970
 the spaak chart will not release his 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 design for fifa 16 cards and from that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.460
 moment then this series will begin to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 also have the prediction of the cards 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.890
 for fifa 16 of the players who 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.950
 will handle the various various transfers 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 so let's start immediately with leaving a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.180
 nice lay obviously as always a nice 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.129
 300 I like it is just a beast e 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.899
 comment on themes with the players who 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.809
 you would like me to deal later 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's start with the three players of today three 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.210
 two players tied in the series entry 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 a and an outgoing one and let's start right away 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.390
 with miranda because as you know miranda 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.790
 and has pretty much a few days 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.920
 who is talking about it half series a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.490
 but it's practically on miranda today 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 let's talk about why because of it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 evince in the last hours miranda is 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.570
 very close to your own at a step 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 from the inter that should pay about 12 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 millions and a half plus 2 bonuses then 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.659
 in the end it would cost around 15 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.960
 millions but should get on loan 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.600
 with a redemption obligation is a figure a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.720
 high considering the fact that the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.659
 player is almost 31 years old will accomplish them 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
 I think 31 years soon and then spend 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.580
 such a large figure 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.400
 more obviously also the engagement 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.650
 it's hard for a thirty- one year old though 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.630
 thirty-one, thirty-one year old though 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.820
 however consider that miranda is one 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.340
 of the best in his role still 30 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.580
 years is still one of the best 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 power plants that are in Europe and together 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.360
 a godina always made a couple 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.980
 really incredible to much power plants 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.729
 very strong at the athletic madrid 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.760
 then we will have to see how the athletic 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.120
 part greece jimènez which is very strong e 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 very young as you will prepare as you are 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.860
 how it will replace it in miranda anyway 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.560
 let's talk about the second player of this 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.370
 episode another player who is anyway 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.709
 been in the last few days 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.060
 treated by many teams 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.990
 we are talking about carlos bacca neo 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.640
 graduated champion of Europe 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.860
 the europa league is obviously with the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.220
 great seville striker e 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.620
 probably that is probably it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.080
 treating Rome right now 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.640
 rome that after several names that are 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.160
 come out these days including that one 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.840
 of gecko which however seems to be one 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.510
 negotiation quite difficult by the way 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.600
 of costs it is also this 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.230
 but the cow one is being treated 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.130
 with executives, etc., etc. 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.519
 in the various teams and the man berry 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.489
 probably the ideal man for 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.260
 re-establish the attack of the Rome Gervinho 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.739
 I don't know if people are already official or 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.840
 however, it will go away even for a while 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.480
 bit of money 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.450
 we know he is the main problem 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.030
 of obsessively speaking Rome was 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.360
 that lacked the point that made goals e 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.550
 cow may indeed indeed be if 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.400
 the player who will arrive in Rome 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.040
 could straighten things out 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.170
 fix everything but there is always 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.630
 the economic problem bach a player 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.820
 that he has already taken much from him 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.580
 in addition it should have a clause 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.640
 termination of about 30 million and below 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.720
 of that one cannot go therefore 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.310
 it would be a blow economically speaking 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.480
 very important however we will see in the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.940
 next days new updates 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.380
 because anyway we are here too 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.740
 talking about one of the best strikers 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.810
 present in Europe probably while 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.630
 let's go with the third player player 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.840
 outgoing as I was telling you that is 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.790
 carlitos tevez that by now it seems that the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.459
 his future will be decided will leave 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.480
 probably almost certainly the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.100
 juventus to go to the boca however in 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.050
 Argentine to end his career 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.850
 lately in these last days yes 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.440
 there was talk of a possible landing in 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.350
 teams such as athletic madrid 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.230
 or especially paris saint germain though 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.420
 none of these goals will be satisfied 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.840
 from the player who should return 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.910
 precisely in Argentina will not go free 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.710
 because he wouldn't be right either 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.780
 still a year of contract with juve 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.030
 so the boca should pay it again 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.970
 no figures are known, but yes 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.600
 I will know later, however, I think 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.730
 that this is a hit-and-run 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.990
 really very hard for juventus for 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.150
 the simple reason tevez is 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.500
 probably the best player that 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.740
 still has the best striker in 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.720
 pink and was the player who has him 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.700
 Juventus allowed to do that 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.280
 quality leap that you might not have 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.380
 done if tevez had not been there 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.930
 solved many problems this year tevez 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.240
 and therefore its absence could be 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.270
 serious in the next year and true that 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.820
 has taken bala is true that there is anyway 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.190
 morata llorente will go away 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.600
 it is true that he probably could 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.730
 get kitsch manzù that you are 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.330
 dealing in these hours these days 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.160
 but in my opinion it is impossible to replace 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.640
 tevez with these players and then 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.500
 probably the power of juve 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.230
 next year it will be a little bit 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.180
 lower however you are talking too 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.890
 of any reinforcements such as 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.530
 cavani of paris saint germain that 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.240
 could be a big blow to the 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.010
 juventus however as I said before yes 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.750
 will see everything in the next few hours 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.480
 coming days to understand a little bit about it 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.890
 this market will evolve, however raga 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.770
 as always I invite you to be born a 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.110
 nice like a 300.000 ci casco will come out a 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.160
 new video you subscribe to my channel

 writing what you think of these 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.800
 transfers and above all 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.660
 advise me some notes of 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.560
 market that you have heard in these 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.420
 days 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.410
 we'll see you guys at the next video 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.410
