 has two regional selections that 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.320
 are various spells 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.090

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.189
 rs quebec and you are the only director 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.950
 technique that has two regions so 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.689
 choose appalaches and quebec must 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.210
 cover for one person but 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.419
 as I'm rocked you do not have the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.980
 to do was not his exactly his 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.000
 jokes and arguments what is it 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.649
 go here today 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.910
 training selections 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.410
 Quebec Regional Offices and Boiler 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.790
 Appalachian and the facts the coaches 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.129
 a sam studied boiler-appalachian 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.379
 and sonia national sensors 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.539
 are in the process of tweaking the last 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.109
 preparations before the Quebec games that 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.109
 take place next week 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.530
 it was the head coach of the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.920
 regional selection of u13 from that of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 appalaches 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.530
 What are you doing today 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.740
 it's really about doing the last 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.820
 preparative example working on the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.930
 things and then this afternoon we 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 is working a lot on finishing like 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:18.320
 we can see it behind this onions and 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 dany you are both coaches of 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.650
 the regional selection of the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.270
 national capital- blow your plan to 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.030
 match for facts from quebec ago 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.190
 two objectives I would say to perform 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.510
 the team is ranked in the three 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.900
 first to have a medal 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.570
 and then it's at the level of the players 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.350
 individually to be able to replace 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.000
 between five and seven on teams if 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.800
 you are like the south shore of quebec and 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.640
 the north shore of which is what you are 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.350
 in the same division 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.820
 yes we are in the same god division 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.950
 so we will face them at our 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.710
 second match then in this case we 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.690
 we have avoided confronting each other 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 did you keep secret before 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.200
 the ultimate ace competition that 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.990
 take say what is your system of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.310
 game even if a secret land side a month 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 that I advocate it's really the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.899
 4-3-3 system that allows us to find 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.860
 one of the triangulation on the ground 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.929
 which he is able to connect 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.550
 easily that angles that are 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.990
 interesting then it allows us to 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.390
 get more balloons behind 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.630
 the opposing defenders 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.140
 the soe system have looked at this niche and 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.240
 maybe secret we want 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.310
 play in 4-2-3-1 with a good 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.770
 balloon circulation 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:34.510
 bet on the security progression of the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:36.970
 funny balloon to train side by side and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.190
 the admission view-there is still in 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.020
 the quebec region but to train 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.420
 with appalachian boiler next to it 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.040
 always the good harmony that reigns 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.630
 in the region of quebec which is 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.340
 wonderful by the way because I 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.170
 think that's part of the success too 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.760
 of the team everyone knows one 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.780
 little is sure when made 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.610
 the ground against lyon we feel 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.610
 really the pebble of a competition 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.230
 who is who and still scene and 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.269
 the team with the quests are the most in 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.500
 difficulty what do you think live those 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.269
 of a team that moves very well 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.920
 balloon moves fast they are 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.780
 able to play as much course as one 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.760
 in either for a defense and fish 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.320
 of scruples this is the divine in our 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.519
 hen on the south shore currently the 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.519
 would not choose Russia 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.109
 who talked about that players can 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.099
 to be tracked can be tracked 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.840
 for which team 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.760
 a regional selection it's just a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.409
 walk in along what said 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.670
 that they have in their five career 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.989
 hours later they can be 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.140
 screened for Quebec teams 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.299
 so in u14 the alley of the tracks have 13 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.590
 years we have this week to be able to 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.359
 future talents for his equipment the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.829
 if a preparation camp so how 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.609
 it worked what the team eats and 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.370
 sleeps together 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.930
 yes the team eats sleeps together at all 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.579
 moment so within two and a half days 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.099

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.870

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.400
 laval university which he made his father 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.079
 and two by two tries we celebrate 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.739
 pairing to develop some 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.079
 complicity 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.730
 and then we come to eat always 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.590
