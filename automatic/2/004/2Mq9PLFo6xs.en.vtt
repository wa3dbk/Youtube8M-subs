00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.990
 Let's talk about the central issue that is 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.200
 menu design and inputs that we will 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.689
 need where we are going to buy them is 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.840
 a dilemma when we start a 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.140
 food business the fact of knowing 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.470
 exactly what will succeed and that 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.450
 I will not have it and I think 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.759
 after having seen so many 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.620
 coffee shops restaurants and bars and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.989
 after having had certain 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.149
 consultancies with them we think 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.210
 that when we design a menu 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.730
 there must be specific elements and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.489
 other general elements but about 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.780
 everything is that they took an approximation 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.760
 Very practical very mercadological is not what 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.969
 that I like my chef is not what I 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.429
 like my owner but that is what the 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.150
 more people accept and what to people more 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.550
 he likes we can not go against 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.040
 what people want to eat 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.070
 and that is a principle that can be done 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.410
 break a restaurant many people we 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.560
 he says is that in my place where I live I do not 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.840
 There is German food and I think that I 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.850
 would be the first one has not been put to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 think that for some reason the food 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.680
 German may be that the taste does not 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.980
 like the sauces do not like that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 the beer is very strong and this 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.330
 can affect us brutally I put him 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.900
 an example the case of Mexican food 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.270
 the spicy is so different the spicy 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.730
 that you feel in Peruvian food or in 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.250
 the Colombian that is sweeter at 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.440
 spicy that is used in Mexico that is 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 absolutely similar to Thai is 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.560
 a very strong itch and there is habanero and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.390
 jalapeÃ±o and other flavors that the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.590
 Mexicans we are used to them 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 and not like that people from other countries and when 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.790
 we consider that menu we must of 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.690
 consider that consumption not only 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:12.830
 national but local and the differences 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.810
 the tastes what people prefer 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.570
 for that there is what is called the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.900
 menu engineering and engineering 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.380
 menu means that we design the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.480
 menu with the customer we go designing 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.370
 little by little it is designed according to what is going 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.310
 preferring what is being asked and what 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.530
 that we are going to clarify a little more 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.050
 let's give an example that you want a 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.360
 American food restaurant and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.460
 so when you start 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.920
 with us we recommend about 30 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.040
 most dishes because if not we 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.959
 complicates the inventory too much and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.390
 then you start with a line of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.180
 burgers starts also with a 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.210
 line of author fries begins 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.300
 with burritos and tex-mex food in order 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.610
 how are we designing according to taste 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.520
 of the client if the client asks very much 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.530
 the burgers we can handle 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.080
 hamburger promotions we can 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.270
 make the hamburger bar grow 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.800
 we can play so that there is more 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.620
 utility or that they sell more 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.660
 burgers and if we see that always and 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.880
 simply in that restaurant in 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.580
 particular the salads are not eaten 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.280
 then you have to make changes to the menu on 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.300
 menu is not written as the tables of 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:40.140
 I have four things for you that we have 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.140
 what to do to engineer our menu 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.370
