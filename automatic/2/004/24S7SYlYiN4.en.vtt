getting your your porch or your door wet
well<00:00:11.550> there's<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.759> reason<00:00:11.940> for<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.330> it's

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
well there's a reason for that it's

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.250 
well there's a reason for that it's

other side of the house if your systems
functioning<00:00:30.090> properly<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.599> condensation

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
functioning properly the condensation

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.290 
functioning properly the condensation
that<00:00:31.500> builds<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> condenser<00:00:32.640> which<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that builds up on the condenser which is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.830 
that builds up on the condenser which is
99%<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> time<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.070> attic<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.840> coming

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
99% of the time in your attic is coming

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330 
99% of the time in your attic is coming
out<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.290> tube<00:00:37.500> where<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:37.950> supposed<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
out of the tube where it's supposed to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
out of the tube where it's supposed to
which<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> fairly<00:00:39.120> inconspicuously

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
which is a fairly inconspicuously

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.180 
which is a fairly inconspicuously
normally<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> compressor<00:00:42.090> outdoors

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
normally it's by the compressor outdoors

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
normally it's by the compressor outdoors
this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.430> necessary<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.780> water<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this is necessary because the water the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.490 
this is necessary because the water the
condensation<00:00:46.890> building<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.600> unit

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
condensation building up in the unit

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
condensation building up in the unit
needs<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.010> somewhere<00:00:50.219> otherwise<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.940> will

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
needs to go somewhere otherwise it will

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.470 
needs to go somewhere otherwise it will
damage<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.449> house<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.610> when<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.820> backs<00:00:54.210> up

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
damage your house so when this backs up

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
damage your house so when this backs up
it<00:00:54.780> clogs<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.620> algae<00:00:56.129> which<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.550> very

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it clogs up with algae which is very

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
it clogs up with algae which is very
common<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.410> then<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> water<00:00:58.859> starts<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> get

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
common and then the water starts to get

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
common and then the water starts to get
diverted<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> drip<00:01:00.480> pan<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> Attic

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
diverted into a drip pan in the Attic

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
diverted into a drip pan in the Attic
and<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.550> other<00:01:02.960> condensation

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and that's what the other condensation

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
and that's what the other condensation
line<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.379> letting<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
line is letting you know is that the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
line is letting you know is that the
water<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.360> building<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
water is then building up in that so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
water is then building up in that so
what<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.700> clear<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
what you need to do is clear out this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
what you need to do is clear out this
line<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.869> I'll<00:01:10.409> show<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> where<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
line and I'll show you where to do that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.969 
line and I'll show you where to do that
so<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.360> you'll<00:01:12.540> need<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.380> brave<00:01:13.770> your
