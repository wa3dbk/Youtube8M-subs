 phlegmatically welcome to a call of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.650

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.949
 new class to present the wish 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.720
 Calling class is nothing now 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.650
 nevertheless I find how important and me 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.930
 also like the idea that I had 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 times on an old channel and indeed 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.109
 write what weapon you want to see 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.290
 which perks you want to see which 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.410
 killstreak should use just one 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 krans and that's important to me now 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.469

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.250
 frequently in forum at the pc plays of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.490
 really flawless black ops 1 but 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.500
