00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
show you the points in which he would

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.650 
show you the points in which he would
turn<00:00:38.770> around<00:00:38.920> so<00:00:39.789> make<00:00:39.969> sure<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:40.210> take<00:00:40.390> cover

enough<00:01:05.470> for<00:01:05.740> behind<00:01:06.250> him<00:01:06.550> so<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.330> know

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
enough for behind him so that you know

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.270 
enough for behind him so that you know
you<00:01:07.660> could<00:01:07.870> just<00:01:08.020> tail<00:01:08.230> him<00:01:08.380> properly<00:01:08.710> you'll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
you could just tail him properly you'll

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.220 
you could just tail him properly you'll
turn<00:01:09.460> her<00:01:09.580> all<00:01:09.760> right<00:01:09.970> there<00:01:10.210> so<00:01:10.450> turns<00:01:11.080> around

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
turn her all right there so turns around

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.060 
turn her all right there so turns around
like<00:01:11.530> three<00:01:11.920> or<00:01:12.070> four<00:01:12.100> different<00:01:12.430> times<00:01:14.070> so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
like three or four different times so

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.410 
like three or four different times so
all<00:01:15.220> this<00:01:15.370> is<00:01:15.460> pretty<00:01:15.610> straightforward<00:01:15.940> now

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
all this is pretty straightforward now

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.510 
all this is pretty straightforward now
once<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.900> finished<00:01:17.020> now<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.250> order<00:01:18.400> to

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
once that is finished now in order to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.640 
once that is finished now in order to
perform<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:19.150> first<00:01:19.390> optional<00:01:19.960> objective

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
perform the first optional objective

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.670 
perform the first optional objective
which<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.700> static<00:01:22.150> eavesdrop<00:01:22.870> make<00:01:23.470> sure

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
which is the static eavesdrop make sure

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.260 
which is the static eavesdrop make sure
you<00:01:23.860> take<00:01:24.100> cover<00:01:24.400> right<00:01:24.730> behind<00:01:25.090> these

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
you take cover right behind these

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.860 
you take cover right behind these
barrels

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
barrels

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.230 
barrels
oddly<00:01:26.500> enough<00:01:26.710> sometimes<00:01:27.460> if<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.760> glitch<00:01:28.030> up

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
oddly enough sometimes if it glitch up

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.430 
oddly enough sometimes if it glitch up
and<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.450> would<00:01:28.570> have<00:01:28.660> trouble<00:01:28.870> going<00:01:29.230> up<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
and I would have trouble going up the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.340 
and I would have trouble going up the
stairs<00:01:29.710> or<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.400> mine<00:01:30.940> below<00:01:31.300> might<00:01:31.690> detect<00:01:32.170> me

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
stairs or a mine below might detect me

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.840 
stairs or a mine below might detect me
but<00:01:32.740> don't<00:01:32.830> worry<00:01:33.070> about<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.490> that's<00:01:33.670> what

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
but don't worry about that that's what

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.730

reasons not as Joker hiding into a dime
well<00:02:04.150> I<00:02:05.430> guess<00:02:06.430> those<00:02:06.640> independent<00:02:07.390> duty<00:02:07.810> when

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
well I guess those independent duty when

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.660 
well I guess those independent duty when
I'd<00:02:08.140> like<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.379> do<00:02:08.530> with<00:02:08.649> them<00:02:08.800> right<00:02:09.009> but<00:02:09.489> for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670

I'd like to do with them right but for
for<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.119> good<00:02:10.299> reason<00:02:10.689> I<00:02:10.869> mean<00:02:11.109> he<00:02:11.230> can't

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
for for good reason I mean he can't

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.729 
for for good reason I mean he can't
finish<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:12.209> selling<00:02:13.209> fake<00:02:13.450> money<00:02:13.689> so<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.650> any

finish it selling fake money so in any
event<00:02:14.859> once<00:02:15.340> you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
event once you

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.340 
event once you
get<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.180> point<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:16.720> he<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:17.080> meet<00:02:17.200> up

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
get to this point now he can meet up

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.320

with<00:02:17.470> his<00:02:17.590> buddy<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.790> now<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.000> need<00:02:19.240> to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
with his buddy and now we need to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330 
with his buddy and now we need to
perform<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.870> mobile<00:02:20.410> you've<00:02:20.890> struck<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
perform a mobile you've struck the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.130 
perform a mobile you've struck the
problem<00:02:21.819> with<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.690> sometimes

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
problem with this one was that sometimes

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140 
problem with this one was that sometimes
they<00:02:23.530> would<00:02:23.650> randomly<00:02:24.190> turn<00:02:24.400> around<00:02:24.730> because

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
they would randomly turn around because

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.630 
they would randomly turn around because
they<00:02:25.330> would<00:02:25.510> bump<00:02:25.750> into<00:02:25.990> each<00:02:26.020> other<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.610> you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
they would bump into each other so you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.309 
they would bump into each other so you
want<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> stay<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.390> back<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.870> circle

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
want to stay to the back of the circle

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.199 
want to stay to the back of the circle

just might have to Reno it to a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.270 
just might have to Reno it to a
checkpoint<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.770> only<00:02:41.920> could<00:02:42.100> stay

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
objective so you could start this riot

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.360 
objective so you could start this riot
here<00:02:50.020> just<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.440> build<00:02:50.650> your<00:02:50.800> crowd<00:02:51.070> up<00:02:51.280> a

here just to build your crowd up a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.560 
here just to build your crowd up a
little<00:02:51.550> bit<00:02:51.700> but<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:51.910> didn't<00:02:52.209> really<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.540> too

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
little bit but that didn't really do too

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.750 
little bit but that didn't really do too
much<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.620> noticed<00:02:54.040> would<00:02:54.160> work<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.580> most

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
much what I noticed would work the most

much what I noticed would work the most
was<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.510> Vice<00:02:55.690> state<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.769> right<00:02:57.100> back<00:02:57.880> of

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
synchronization on this mission right

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.090 
synchronization on this mission right
here<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:50.720> can<00:04:50.870> see<00:04:51.100> something-something

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
here so you can see something-something

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.170 
here so you can see something-something
on<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.370> side<00:04:52.600> they<00:04:53.600> get<00:04:53.720> tally<00:04:53.960> up<00:04:54.169> dem<00:04:54.380> points

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
on the side they get tally up dem points

on the side they get tally up dem points
and<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.330> at<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.600> beginning<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:57.199> think<00:04:57.289> of

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
and this is at the beginning I think of

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.600 
and this is at the beginning I think of
sequence<00:04:58.009> 8<00:04:58.600> so<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.930> is<00:05:00.080> little<00:05:01.039> tedious<00:05:01.280> to

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
sequence 8 so this is little tedious to

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.430 
sequence 8 so this is little tedious to
say<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.880> least<00:05:02.090> cuz<00:05:02.419> it<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.750> was<00:05:02.900> on<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.169> for<00:05:03.410> a

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
say the least cuz it I was on this for a

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.570 
say the least cuz it I was on this for a
little<00:05:03.590> while<00:05:03.830> trying<00:05:04.250> different<00:05:04.370> things

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
little while trying different things
