00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.690 

the<00:00:24.470> spring<00:00:24.710> stairs<00:00:24.920> are<00:00:25.100> pretty<00:00:25.130> easiest

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
the spring stairs are pretty easiest

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.070 
the spring stairs are pretty easiest
settup<00:00:25.880> once<00:00:26.180> you<00:00:26.270> get<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.480> hang<00:00:26.510> of<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:26.990> I

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
settup once you get the hang of it and I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.810 
settup once you get the hang of it and I
actually<00:00:27.230> prefer<00:00:27.470> them<00:00:28.010> to<00:00:28.040> like<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.460> figure

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
actually prefer them to like a figure

actually prefer them to like a figure

where<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.710> have<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.340> do<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:31.580> crazy

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
where you have to do this crazy

balancing act with the log or heavy rock
you<00:00:34.850> know<00:00:34.970> you<00:00:35.030> don't<00:00:35.420> have<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.630> do<00:00:35.720> any<00:00:35.900> of

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
you know you don't have to do any of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.600 
you know you don't have to do any of
that<00:00:36.050> there<00:00:36.350> there's<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.680> little<00:00:36.920> bit<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.430> a

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
that there there's a little bit of a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.850 
that there there's a little bit of a
balancing<00:00:38.420> maneuvering<00:00:38.870> but<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:39.410> not<00:00:39.620> bad

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
balancing maneuvering but it's not bad

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.490 
balancing maneuvering but it's not bad
at<00:00:40.070> all<00:00:40.220> once<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:40.520> get<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.760> hang<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.059> it

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
at all once you get the hang of it

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.689 
at all once you get the hang of it
they're<00:00:42.500> really<00:00:42.800> effective<00:00:43.010> for<00:00:43.400> catching

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
they're really effective for catching

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.820 
they're really effective for catching
small<00:00:43.850> games<00:00:44.239> such<00:00:44.540> as<00:00:44.570> squirrels<00:00:45.140> or<00:00:45.410> rabbits

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
small games such as squirrels or rabbits

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.770 
small games such as squirrels or rabbits
anything<00:00:46.760> enlarger<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.330> there<00:00:47.480> then<00:00:47.660> you're

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
anything enlarger in there then you're

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.680 
anything enlarger in there then you're
gonna<00:00:47.870> need<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.080> larger<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:49.489> know<00:00:49.629> tree<00:00:50.629> to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
gonna need a larger you know tree to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.920 
gonna need a larger you know tree to
bend<00:00:50.930> over<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.170> use<00:00:51.320> as<00:00:51.500> your<00:00:51.620> spring<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.930> you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
bend over to use as your spring and you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.209 
bend over to use as your spring and you
know<00:00:54.020> it's<00:00:54.110> kind<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.290> problematic<00:00:54.649> as<00:00:54.950> trees

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
know it's kind of problematic as trees

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.870 
know it's kind of problematic as trees
get<00:00:55.460> larger<00:00:56.270> they<00:00:57.260> get<00:00:57.710> less<00:00:57.980> flexible<00:00:58.579> so

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
get larger they get less flexible so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.580 
get larger they get less flexible so
that<00:00:59.030> that's<00:00:59.510> spring<00:00:59.780> action<00:00:59.989> won't<00:01:00.260> be<00:01:00.410> as

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
that that's spring action won't be as

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.400 
that that's spring action won't be as
easy

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
easy

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.700 
easy
so<00:01:03.410> here's<00:01:03.680> what<00:01:03.860> I've<00:01:03.950> got<00:01:04.100> set<00:01:04.309> up<00:01:04.369> guys<00:01:05.710> so

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
so here's what I've got set up guys so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.950 
so here's what I've got set up guys so
what<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.009> have<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.759> first<00:01:08.030> step<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.570> get<00:01:08.660> to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
what I have the first step is to get to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.380 
what I have the first step is to get to
kind<00:01:09.289> of<00:01:09.410> I'm<00:01:09.920> colos<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.460> like<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.610> number<00:01:10.970> 7

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
kind of I'm colos that like a number 7

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.840 
kind of I'm colos that like a number 7
stick<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.440> you<00:01:12.530> get<00:01:12.680> two<00:01:12.830> of<00:01:12.860> those<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.460> you

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
stick and you get two of those and you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.330 
stick and you get two of those and you
stick<00:01:14.149> them<00:01:14.300> into<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.930> ground<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.500> then<00:01:16.250> you

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
stick them into the ground and then you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.389 
stick them into the ground and then you
run<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.580> bar<00:01:16.850> going<00:01:17.119> across<00:01:17.300> them<00:01:18.250> then<00:01:19.250> you

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
run a bar going across them then you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.370 
run a bar going across them then you
have<00:01:19.610> what's<00:01:20.090> called<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.420> toggle<00:01:20.690> switch<00:01:20.869> right

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
have what's called a toggle switch right

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.060 
have what's called a toggle switch right
here<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:21.890> this<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.820> attached<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:24.070> bent

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
here and this is attached to the bent

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.740 
here and this is attached to the bent
over<00:01:25.220> sapling<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.060> as<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.210> can<00:01:26.270> see<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:26.570> is

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
over sapling and as you can see this is

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.140 
over sapling and as you can see this is
not<00:01:26.930> very<00:01:27.260> long<00:01:27.470> as<00:01:28.010> all<00:01:28.220> at<00:01:28.430> all<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.790> want<00:01:29.000> the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
not very long as all at all you want the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.750 
not very long as all at all you want the
sapling<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:30.170> be<00:01:30.290> pretty<00:01:30.680> close<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.070> your

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
sapling to be pretty close to your

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.500 
sapling to be pretty close to your
toggle<00:01:32.180> switch<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:33.290> give<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.680> maximum

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
toggle switch to give it the maximum

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.200 
toggle switch to give it the maximum
like<00:01:35.510> whip<00:01:35.810> effect<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.850> as<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.150> imagine

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
like whip effect so as you can imagine

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.140 
like whip effect so as you can imagine
this<00:01:39.110> toggle<00:01:39.409> switch<00:01:39.590> wants<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.670> get<00:01:40.850> pulled

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
this toggle switch wants to get pulled

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.330 
this toggle switch wants to get pulled
underneath<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.810> here<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.439> tree<00:01:42.799> can<00:01:42.979> Bend

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
underneath of here so this tree can Bend

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.840 
underneath of here so this tree can Bend
for<00:01:43.580> it

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
for it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.840 
for it
so<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:44.360> have<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.600> stop<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:46.400> that's<00:01:46.670> where

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
so we have to stop that and that's where

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.090 
so we have to stop that and that's where
the<00:01:47.000> bait<00:01:47.180> stick<00:01:47.540> comes<00:01:47.810> in<00:01:47.930> handy<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the bait stick comes in handy so the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.590 
the bait stick comes in handy so the
base<00:01:49.250> stick<00:01:49.490> is<00:01:49.729> just<00:01:49.759> kind<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.119> propped<00:01:50.390> up

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
base stick is just kind of propped up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.270 
base stick is just kind of propped up
against<00:01:50.930> here<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:51.799> on<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> other<00:01:52.100> side

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
against here and then on the other side

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.249 
against here and then on the other side
it's<00:01:52.759> propped<00:01:53.000> up<00:01:53.210> against<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.750> post<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.229> I

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
it's propped up against the post that I

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.420 
it's propped up against the post that I
dug<00:01:54.500> into<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.829> ground

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
dug into the ground

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
dug into the ground
now<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:57.150> flat<00:01:57.450> ends<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
now I just have flat ends here in the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.860 
now I just have flat ends here in the
base<00:01:58.260> sticks<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.870> file

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
base sticks but you can actually file

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.960 
base sticks but you can actually file
these<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.409> two<00:02:01.620> points<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.190> both<00:02:02.400> ends<00:02:02.790> just

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
these down two points on both ends just

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.260 
these down two points on both ends just
to<00:02:03.090> make<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.570> much<00:02:03.900> more<00:02:04.170> sensitive<00:02:05.270> so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
to make it that much more sensitive so

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.090 
to make it that much more sensitive so
as<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.750> goes<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.080> rope<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.710> time<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
as it goes to the rope it's time to the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.219 
as it goes to the rope it's time to the
toggle<00:02:08.280> switch<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.479> continues<00:02:10.050> on

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
toggle switch and then it continues on

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.540 
toggle switch and then it continues on
here<00:02:10.740> before<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.310> drape<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.820> over<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.570> spring

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
here before we drape it over the spring

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.500 
here before we drape it over the spring
drape<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> over<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.200> trigger<00:02:16.200> stick<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.910> as

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
drape it over the trigger stick so as

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.270 
drape it over the trigger stick so as
you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.720> imagine<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.200> small<00:02:19.350> animal<00:02:19.830> come<00:02:20.130> in

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
you can imagine a small animal come in

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.910 
you can imagine a small animal come in
here<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.090> he'll<00:02:21.450> stick<00:02:21.720> his<00:02:21.750> head<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.530> here

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
here and he'll stick his head right here

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.860 
here and he'll stick his head right here
to<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> bait<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.510> now<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.660> want<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to get to the bait and now you want to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.160 
to get to the bait and now you want to
tie<00:02:25.080> some<00:02:25.980> guts<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.670> or<00:02:27.060> some<00:02:27.750> peanut

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
tie some guts to this or some peanut

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 
tie some guts to this or some peanut
butter<00:02:28.290> smeared<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> stick<00:02:29.280> whatever<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
butter smeared on the stick whatever you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.330 
butter smeared on the stick whatever you
can<00:02:30.230> see<00:02:31.230> he'll<00:02:31.380> come<00:02:31.560> along<00:02:31.770> here<00:02:32.070> he'll

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
can see he'll come along here he'll

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.100 
can see he'll come along here he'll
stick<00:02:32.610> his<00:02:32.640> head<00:02:32.910> right<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.900> he's

stick his head right here and as he's
gnawing<00:02:34.440> away<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.360> it'll<00:02:37.230> trip

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
gnawing away just like that it'll trip

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.380 
gnawing away just like that it'll trip
the<00:02:38.250> trigger<00:02:38.790> stick<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:41.010> tree<00:02:41.310> will<00:02:41.670> stand

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the trigger stick the tree will stand

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.110 
the trigger stick the tree will stand
upright<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.830> snare<00:02:44.160> will<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.610> around<00:02:44.910> its

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
upright and the snare will go around its

00:02:45.120 --> 00:03:30.990 
upright and the snare will go around its
and<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.540> catch<00:02:45.750> them

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.120 

so<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.270> set<00:03:32.600> this<00:03:32.750> up<00:03:33.020> just<00:03:33.050> for<00:03:33.440> demonstration

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
so I set this up just for demonstration

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.920 
so I set this up just for demonstration
purposes<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.940> there's<00:03:35.120> actually<00:03:35.600> several

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
purposes and there's actually several

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.560 
purposes and there's actually several
things<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.800> I<00:03:36.980> did<00:03:37.550> wrong<00:03:37.880> when<00:03:38.210> setting

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
things that I did wrong when setting

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.420 
things that I did wrong when setting
this<00:03:38.690> up<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.050> I<00:03:39.080> left<00:03:39.290> them<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.370> I

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
this up and I left them there just so I

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.330 
this up and I left them there just so I
can<00:03:40.610> show<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.850> guys<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.590> first<00:03:42.830> thing<00:03:43.100> is

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
can show you guys so the first thing is

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.910 
can show you guys so the first thing is
all<00:03:43.940> these<00:03:44.180> little<00:03:44.240> branches<00:03:44.900> here<00:03:45.200> they're

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
all these little branches here they're

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.949 
all these little branches here they're
just<00:03:46.040> going<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.190> create<00:03:46.459> more<00:03:46.730> air<00:03:47.240> resistant

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
just going to create more air resistant

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.240 
just going to create more air resistant
when<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:49.340> tree<00:03:49.910> gets<00:03:50.320> upright<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.560> they<00:03:52.070> can

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
when the tree gets upright and they can

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.310 
when the tree gets upright and they can
actually<00:03:52.730> also<00:03:52.970> get<00:03:53.300> caught<00:03:53.540> in<00:03:53.690> other<00:03:53.870> trees

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
actually also get caught in other trees

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.050 
actually also get caught in other trees
that<00:03:54.709> might<00:03:55.130> be<00:03:55.250> around<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.730> want<00:03:55.940> to

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
that might be around so you want to

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.220 
that might be around so you want to
remove<00:03:56.720> all<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.050> branches<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:58.959> your<00:03:59.959> actual

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
remove all the branches on your actual

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.190 
remove all the branches on your actual
spring<00:04:00.740> and<00:04:01.040> that's<00:04:01.670> going<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.180> help<00:04:02.390> it<00:04:02.660> just

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
spring and that's going to help it just

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.180 
spring and that's going to help it just
go<00:04:03.739> through<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.010> air<00:04:04.130> more<00:04:04.400> smoothly<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:06.190> you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
go through the air more smoothly and you

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.860 
go through the air more smoothly and you
know<00:04:07.310> give<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:07.580> more<00:04:07.730> whip<00:04:08.030> when<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.420> comes<00:04:08.630> up

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
know give it more whip when it comes up

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.600 
know give it more whip when it comes up
and<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.500> mean<00:04:09.680> as<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:09.920> can<00:04:09.950> see<00:04:10.190> here<00:04:10.370> it's<00:04:10.489> also

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
and I mean as you can see here it's also

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.940 
and I mean as you can see here it's also
kind<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.120> interfering<00:04:11.750> with<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.320> trap<00:04:12.560> of

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
kind of interfering with the trap of

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.449 
kind of interfering with the trap of
that<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.810> second<00:04:15.140> thing<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.320> did<00:04:15.470> wrong<00:04:15.650> is

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
that the second thing I did wrong is

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.030 
that the second thing I did wrong is
I've<00:04:16.880> actually<00:04:17.090> left<00:04:17.390> too<00:04:17.780> much<00:04:18.049> slack<00:04:18.650> here

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
I've actually left too much slack here

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.620 
I've actually left too much slack here
in<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.340> rope<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:20.000> don't<00:04:20.299> know<00:04:20.359> if<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.510> guys

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
in this rope I don't know if you guys

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.050 
in this rope I don't know if you guys
noticed<00:04:21.079> but<00:04:21.140> when<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:21.530> actually<00:04:22.130> tightens

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
noticed but when this actually tightens

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.320 
noticed but when this actually tightens
up<00:04:23.330> all<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.870> way<00:04:24.250> it's<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.550> is<00:04:25.730> practically

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
up all the way it's this is practically

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.440 
up all the way it's this is practically
on<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.600> ground<00:04:26.900> made<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> small<00:04:28.160> animal<00:04:28.610> you

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
on the ground made a small animal you

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.330 
on the ground made a small animal you
know<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.810> has<00:04:30.380> some<00:04:30.590> weight<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.950> it<00:04:30.980> might

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
know it has some weight to it might

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.710 
know it has some weight to it might
actually<00:04:31.520> be<00:04:32.060> able<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.300> touch<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.690> ground

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
actually be able to touch the ground

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.380 
actually be able to touch the ground
when<00:04:33.200> this<00:04:33.669> snare<00:04:34.669> goes<00:04:34.940> off<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.830> lastly<00:04:36.830> I

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390

you really want to actually kind of file

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.580 
you really want to actually kind of file
this<00:04:45.410> down<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.890> point<00:04:46.310> on<00:04:46.580> both<00:04:46.790> ends<00:04:47.590> you

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
this down to a point on both ends you

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.100 
this down to a point on both ends you
know<00:04:48.979> an<00:04:49.160> animal<00:04:49.280> could<00:04:49.669> come<00:04:49.940> along<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.630> as

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
know an animal could come along and as

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.200 
know an animal could come along and as
you<00:04:51.200> can<00:04:51.320> see<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.740> mean<00:04:51.860> he<00:04:52.010> could<00:04:52.160> be<00:04:52.430> eating

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
you can see I mean he could be eating

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.570 
you can see I mean he could be eating
the<00:04:53.330> bait<00:04:53.510> away<00:04:53.950> moving<00:04:54.950> this<00:04:55.100> up<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.430> down

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the bait away moving this up and down

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.530 
the bait away moving this up and down
and<00:04:55.850> it's<00:04:55.940> not<00:04:56.180> activating<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.260> trip<00:04:57.530> the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
and it's not activating the trip the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.050 
and it's not activating the trip the
trap<00:04:59.620> so<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.680> want<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.070> make<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.400> calm<00:05:01.700> down<00:05:01.910> to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
trap so you want to make it calm down to

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.040 
trap so you want to make it calm down to
a<00:05:02.090> point<00:05:02.450> so<00:05:02.810> when<00:05:03.280> he<00:05:04.280> just<00:05:04.640> touches<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.479> it

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
a point so when he just touches it it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.659 
a point so when he just touches it it
activates<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.650> trap

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
activates the trap

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.450 
activates the trap
if<00:05:08.570> you<00:05:08.660> don't<00:05:08.810> not<00:05:08.900> have<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.110> tie<00:05:09.410> in<00:05:09.470> air<00:05:09.979> it<00:05:10.280> is

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
if you don't not have a tie in air it is

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.700 
if you don't not have a tie in air it is
the<00:05:10.640> simplest<00:05:11.060> thing<00:05:11.210> in<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.479> world<00:05:11.540> guys

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
the simplest thing in the world guys

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.460 
the simplest thing in the world guys
you<00:05:13.070> take<00:05:13.280> your<00:05:13.780> recorded<00:05:14.780> cherry<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.380> two

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
you take your recorded cherry for two

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.860 
you take your recorded cherry for two
and<00:05:15.560> a<00:05:15.590> half<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:16.729> take<00:05:16.970> this<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.600> just<00:05:17.750> do

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
and a half you take this and you just do

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.360 
and a half you take this and you just do
a<00:05:17.900> simple<00:05:18.169> overhand<00:05:19.130> knot<00:05:19.400> with<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:21.370> doubled

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
a simple overhand knot with the doubled

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.930 
a simple overhand knot with the doubled
up<00:05:22.460> rope<00:05:22.729> here<00:05:22.970> just<00:05:23.330> like<00:05:23.479> that<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:24.940> you're

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
up rope here just like that and you're

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.850 
up rope here just like that and you're
left<00:05:26.180> with<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.600> loop

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
left with a loop

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.010 
left with a loop
now<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.520> just<00:05:28.820> take<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.150> rest<00:05:29.360> of<00:05:29.510> your<00:05:29.690> rope

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
now you just take the rest of your rope

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.810 
now you just take the rest of your rope
and<00:05:30.170> you<00:05:30.290> feed<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.650> through<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:30.980> loop<00:05:31.160> and

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
and you feed it through that loop and

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.970 
and you feed it through that loop and
that<00:05:32.150> creates<00:05:32.510> an<00:05:32.840> adjustable<00:05:33.590> loop<00:05:33.710> just

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
that creates an adjustable loop just

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.500 
that creates an adjustable loop just
like<00:05:34.070> that<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.670> this<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:35.120> what's<00:05:35.360> gonna

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
like that and this is what's gonna

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.380 
like that and this is what's gonna
actually<00:05:35.830> ideally<00:05:36.830> wrap<00:05:37.040> around<00:05:37.400> the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
actually ideally wrap around the

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.940 
actually ideally wrap around the
animal's<00:05:38.810> neck<00:05:39.970> now<00:05:41.050> ideally<00:05:42.050> you'd<00:05:42.680> have

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
animal's neck now ideally you'd have

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.800 
animal's neck now ideally you'd have
some<00:05:43.790> kind<00:05:43.970> of<00:05:44.000> metal<00:05:44.300> wire

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
some kind of metal wire

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.080 
some kind of metal wire
okay<00:05:45.020> copper<00:05:45.410> wire<00:05:45.560> or<00:05:45.740> something<00:05:46.160> because

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
okay copper wire or something because

you know or they can touch the ground
they<00:05:52.340> could<00:05:52.400> actually<00:05:52.730> chew<00:05:53.000> right<00:05:53.210> through

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
they could actually chew right through

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.120 
they could actually chew right through
this<00:05:53.540> rope<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:54.080> get<00:05:54.320> away<00:05:54.410> but<00:05:54.590> even<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:54.980> metal

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
significantly so you know as much excess

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.160

here<00:06:39.620> now<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:40.190> this<00:06:40.970> should<00:06:41.210> help<00:06:41.450> out<00:06:41.750> a<00:06:41.780> lot

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170
