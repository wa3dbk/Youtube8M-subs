 for boxing channel I am lazaro bad bars 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.939
 from san juan puerto rico with the 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.549
 world champion hanna gabriel already 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.690
 the weighing ceremony passed 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.240
 quiet and relaxed as we saw you 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.610
 do a few hours if you were rather and 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.710
 nobody is in he thinks but it's all 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.900
 part of the emotionalism that making 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.990
 back to the ring and I'm happy happy 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.130
 I hope all of you can 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.230
 enjoy these fights that there is a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.820
 high level here on this card and 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.240
 I hope to be one of the best fights in 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 the night they will also think you 153 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.770
 pounds tell me what does this mean you 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.530
 you feel good you spent a lot of work to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.350
 the weight is strong does not pass a great 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.630
 work and nutritionist doctor rafael 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.880
 volleyball is excelently he is one thing 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.130
 incredible and thanks to the collaboration of 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.960
 my daughter who still suck is all 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.840
 it went perfect I did not have to strain 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 very much I have eaten well always 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680
 taking care of course because this is 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.750
 a tough fight needs to be 100% 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.980
 my ability and feed my body 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.920
 good, but 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.470
 I feel like I'm super happy you saw 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.990
 that part and Ramirez are walking with the weight 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.159
 similar but maybe muscle mass 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.330
 you notice more power in you normally 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.570
 it has been like this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.880
 it's hard to find fighters that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.509
 are so grated or that they are so 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.340
 marked mainly he gave me type me 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.750
 my genetics allow it thanks to my 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.360
 that's why, and hard work, not 254 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.619
 for me it is the ideal weight weighing me 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.899
 I really like this weight and I do not 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.869
 I never trust myself from how the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.430
 boxer part of me I think the 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.770
 most important part in a fight the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.560
 mental part and sympathy comes with its 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.780
 powerful mental part then it goes to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.390
 see a big fight wins another detail to 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.210
 take into consideration and there is no 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.130
 kind of enmity there was no phrase 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.050
 from her there was no offense 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 because sometimes like that to try to 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.440
 intimidate boxers they say things 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.130
 what such a com for you 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.670
 It was very cordial it was very very friendly 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.170
 I think tomorrow night will 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.690
 to be very different obviously we have 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.670
 our own interests but in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.860
 weighing everything went quiet I 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.300
 like this kind of scenery, nothing, maybe 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.810
 the last time I lost that was a 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.760
 little bit more more more be like more 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.290
 problematic problem and the day that I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.510
 I have to fight with her again because she's going to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.580
 be more go you will see much more bronze 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 but in this case I'm nothing but happy and 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.510
 happy to have the opportunity and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.850
 give the best of me good thanks to
