00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
to do is look down so it took me a while

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630 
to do is look down so it took me a while
to<00:01:58.110> figure<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.310> pretty

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to figure that out but it's pretty

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.109 
to figure that out but it's pretty
simple<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.350> when<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.469> move<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.189> shows<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
simple and when you move it shows you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.810 
simple and when you move it shows you
moving<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.200> i<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> feature<00:02:05.579> in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
moving so i really like this feature in

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.770 
moving so i really like this feature in
it<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.710> next<00:02:07.979> thing<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.459> gonna<00:02:08.729> make<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it the next thing I'm gonna make is the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.770 
it the next thing I'm gonna make is the
hatch<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.879> also<00:02:11.879> known<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.629> trapdoor

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
hatch or also known as the trapdoor

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.620 
hatch or also known as the trapdoor
so<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> planks<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.030> put<00:02:16.510> it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
so you just get the planks and put it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.320 
so you just get the planks and put it
down<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.110> bottom<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:19.120> make

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
down the bottom like that and you make

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.180 
down the bottom like that and you make
the<00:02:19.540> trap<00:02:19.780> door<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.680> like<00:02:24.160> a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the trap door so this is just like a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.010 
the trap door so this is just like a
chapter<00:02:24.670> all<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:24.970> like<00:02:25.150> kinda<00:02:25.540> like<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> door

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
chapter all it's like kinda like a door

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.130 
chapter all it's like kinda like a door
so<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.640> stand<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.390> when<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.780> hit<00:02:29.020> it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
