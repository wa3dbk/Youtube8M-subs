we're<00:00:10.540> going<00:00:10.630> to<00:00:10.719> explore<00:00:11.200> how<00:00:11.769> to<00:00:11.799> create<00:00:12.249> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
we're going to explore how to create a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.440 
we're going to explore how to create a
configuration<00:00:14.530> of<00:00:14.919> a<00:00:15.459> sheetmetal<00:00:15.730> part<00:00:16.240> done

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
configuration of a sheetmetal part done

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.160 
configuration of a sheetmetal part done
in<00:00:16.630> SolidWorks<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:18.340> shows<00:00:18.610> the<00:00:18.820> flat<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
in SolidWorks that shows the flat and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.560 
in SolidWorks that shows the flat and
there's<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.070> couple<00:00:21.430> ways<00:00:21.580> to<00:00:21.730> do<00:00:22.030> this<00:00:22.210> there's

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
there's a couple ways to do this there's

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.690 
there's a couple ways to do this there's
a<00:00:22.630> manual<00:00:22.870> approach<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:24.310> going<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.550> talk

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
a manual approach I'm going to talk

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.300 
a manual approach I'm going to talk
about<00:00:24.850> the<00:00:25.150> automatic<00:00:25.600> approach<00:00:26.200> which<00:00:27.130> I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
about the automatic approach which I

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.080 
about the automatic approach which I
recommend<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.940> use<00:00:29.370> so<00:00:30.370> let's<00:00:30.610> say<00:00:30.790> that<00:00:30.820> we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
recommend you use so let's say that we

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.500 
recommend you use so let's say that we
have<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.710> u-shaped<00:00:32.710> channel<00:00:33.070> here<00:00:33.340> we'll<00:00:34.329> make

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
have a u-shaped channel here we'll make

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.580 
have a u-shaped channel here we'll make
a<00:00:34.710> sheetmetal<00:00:36.150> shape<00:00:37.150> out<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.540> this<00:00:37.720> by<00:00:38.500> the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
a sheetmetal shape out of this by the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.990 
a sheetmetal shape out of this by the
way<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:38.860> can<00:00:39.130> right<00:00:39.340> mouse<00:00:39.520> click<00:00:39.550> the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
way you can right mouse click the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.350 
way you can right mouse click the
command<00:00:40.300> manager<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:41.350> turn<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.880> sheet

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
command manager and turn on the sheet

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.860 
command manager and turn on the sheet
metal<00:00:43.480> portion<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.640> command<00:00:45.640> manager<00:00:46.120> so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
metal portion of that command manager so

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.680 
metal portion of that command manager so
I'll<00:00:47.050> go<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.260> my<00:00:47.470> base<00:00:47.829> flange<00:00:48.220> tab<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.360> I'll

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
I'll go to my base flange tab and I'll

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.830 
I'll go to my base flange tab and I'll
drag<00:00:50.350> for<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:50.980> length<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:52.120> there's<00:00:52.450> my<00:00:52.630> sheet

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
drag for a length and there's my sheet

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.920 
drag for a length and there's my sheet
metal<00:00:53.110> part<00:00:53.350> okay<00:00:54.160> now<00:00:54.790> notice<00:00:55.030> at<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:55.630> point

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
metal part okay now notice at this point

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.520 
metal part okay now notice at this point
we<00:00:56.350> have<00:00:56.700> just<00:00:57.700> a<00:00:57.820> single<00:00:58.030> body<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:59.230> we<00:00:59.350> have<00:00:59.500> a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
we have just a single body and we have a

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
we have just a single body and we have a
single<00:00:59.920> configuration<00:01:00.070> just<00:01:00.850> default<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.739> if

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
single configuration just default now if

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.039 
single configuration just default now if
you<00:01:03.700> work<00:01:03.910> with<00:01:03.940> sheet<00:01:04.269> metal<00:01:04.360> before<00:01:04.629> you'll

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
you work with sheet metal before you'll

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.230 
you work with sheet metal before you'll
know<00:01:05.229> that<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.860> creates<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.579> flat<00:01:06.969> pattern

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
know that it creates a flat pattern

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.750 
know that it creates a flat pattern
feature<00:01:07.659> at<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.020> end<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.380> tree<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.950> that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
feature at the end of the tree and that

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.060 
feature at the end of the tree and that
flat<00:01:10.090> pattern<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.840> suppressed<00:01:11.470> that's<00:01:11.890> why

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
flat pattern is suppressed that's why

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.680 
flat pattern is suppressed that's why
it's<00:01:12.220> grayed<00:01:12.430> out<00:01:12.659> okay<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.490> if<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.390> were<00:01:16.659> to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
it's grayed out okay now if we were to

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.960 
it's grayed out okay now if we were to
unsuppressed<00:01:17.560> this<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.370> going<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.760> flatten

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
unsuppressed this it's going to flatten

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.899 
unsuppressed this it's going to flatten
out<00:01:19.210> our<00:01:19.420> part<00:01:19.690> but<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.890> way<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.100> recommend<00:01:21.549> you

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
out our part but the way I recommend you

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.300 
out our part but the way I recommend you
configure<00:01:22.630> your<00:01:22.810> part<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.710> following

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
configure your part is the following

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.840 
configure your part is the following
let's<00:01:25.150> all<00:01:25.360> works<00:01:25.600> do<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.930> work<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
let's all works do the work so the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.899 
let's all works do the work so the
secret<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:28.540> is<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.710> just<00:01:30.130> create<00:01:30.369> a

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
secret to this is to just create a

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.260 
secret to this is to just create a
drawing<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.170> drop<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.460> flat<00:01:33.729> pattern<00:01:33.939> view

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
drawing and drop in a flat pattern view

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.070 
drawing and drop in a flat pattern view
that's<00:01:34.540> all<00:01:34.780> we'll<00:01:35.590> save<00:01:35.830> our<00:01:35.979> part<00:01:36.390> okay<00:01:37.420> I'll

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
that's all we'll save our part okay I'll

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.760 
that's all we'll save our part okay I'll
select<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.500> drawing<00:01:38.740> template<00:01:39.130> size<00:01:40.770> we'll

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
select the drawing template size we'll

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.859 
select the drawing template size we'll
go<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.010> our<00:01:42.159> view<00:01:42.460> palette<00:01:42.939> over<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.659> right

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
go to our view palette over on the right

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.200 
go to our view palette over on the right
and<00:01:44.229> we'll<00:01:44.830> grab<00:01:45.130> drag<00:01:45.430> our<00:01:45.670> flat<00:01:45.970> pattern

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
and we'll grab drag our flat pattern

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.780 
and we'll grab drag our flat pattern
view<00:01:46.540> into<00:01:46.900> our<00:01:46.990> drawing<00:01:47.790> automatically

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
view into our drawing automatically

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.109 
view into our drawing automatically
adding<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.270> bin<00:01:49.479> notes<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.799> all<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.909> don't

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
adding the bin notes that's all we don't

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.789 
adding the bin notes that's all we don't
even<00:01:52.360> have<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.750> save<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.170> drawing<00:01:53.439> at<00:01:53.650> this

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
even have to save the drawing at this

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.210 
even have to save the drawing at this
point<00:01:54.130> back<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.270> our<00:01:55.360> part<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.100> something<00:01:57.100> has

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
point back to our part and something has

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.240 
point back to our part and something has
happened<00:01:57.369> inside<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.119> part<00:01:58.330> automatically

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
happened inside the part automatically

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.429 
happened inside the part automatically
it<00:02:00.250> has<00:02:00.460> created<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.119> default<00:02:01.540> SM<00:02:01.960> flat<00:02:02.200> pattern

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
it has created a default SM flat pattern

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.910 
it has created a default SM flat pattern
now<00:02:03.400> if<00:02:03.790> we<00:02:04.000> activate<00:02:04.329> that<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:05.409> flattens

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
now if we activate that that flattens

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.300 
now if we activate that that flattens
our<00:02:06.070> part<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.780> way<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.110> does<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.319> is<00:02:08.560> in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
our part and the way it does that is in

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.550 
our part and the way it does that is in
the<00:02:09.700> derived<00:02:10.090> configuration<00:02:10.989> that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
the derived configuration that

the derived configuration that
unhhhh<00:02:13.560> suppresses<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> flat<00:02:14.670> pattern

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
unhhhh suppresses the flat pattern

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.610 
unhhhh suppresses the flat pattern
feature<00:02:15.299> at<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.569> end<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> tree<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.469> go
