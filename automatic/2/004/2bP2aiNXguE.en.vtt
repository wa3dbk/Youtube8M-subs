00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.870
 yes 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.580
 although he accepted that losing the three 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.959
 classics in 1 tournament would stain the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.719
 leadership they have had in this but 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.490
 2014 Antonio Mohamed also said that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.920
 I would sign lose before chivas heart and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.270
 pumas if this gives me the title of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.970
 corresponding tournament must be champion 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.100
 be champion if not fight to be champion if 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.850
 total where where the title of the glory 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.310
 priceless 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.170
 I do not like it seems kind of party but 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.390
 also what we talked about lately 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.460
 they say we 're going to be first and I 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.140
 show how we are we have to put 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.129
 some parties what we do not want are 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.079
 lose that kind of matches 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.420
 unfortunately it happened like that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.760
 and let's hope that party does not commit 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.839
 same mistakes that we have made and for 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.039
 that we have the thorn in it and 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.859
 we want to win this game when 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.059
 we won 4 to 0 it was not mine with the team and 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.429
 when we also lose the team 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.659
 then I am responsible I am the leader 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.659
 when he wins and when he loses 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.740
 is a pending debt of the subject 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.690
 classics but the good thing about this is that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.270
 you always find something 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.100
 so I love that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.079
 when it was that we did not win it was because 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.850
 compared with another with the other stage 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.159
 when we go super leader they never name 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.899
 that then I like that they are 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.399
 digging are always looking for but 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.409
 I think about winning more I think about winning 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.270
 that the brothers win and tie the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.630
 first general place this illusion that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.630
 we have 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.760
 and really and could be spotted a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.740
 little if the three classics do not win 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.350
 if you stay first they are always going to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 find a place but 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.460
 I think channels even with the mentality 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.600
 put in winning and we have worked very 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.490
 well my team is very good 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.100
 I dream of that I do not think of another in another 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.590
 scenario we classify does 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.460
 three days ago and a fifa date already 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.820
 is a mexico of we qualify then 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.520
 the team thought can show a level 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.490
 I believe that these three parties 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.040
 we have with toluca chivas and atlas 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.840
 can give us that level that that plus 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.179
 that we are missing to reach the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.650
 full team performance cap 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.910
 but wait until this Friday for 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.620
 know the conditions under which 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 arrive miguel layún and in that way know 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.130
 whether they can fill it back in the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.989
 titular box or it will be available for 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.190
 face the chivas with images of 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.480
 Aldo Gutierrez Juan Manuel Terán 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.480
