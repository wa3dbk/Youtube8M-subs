00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.440
 but 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.730
 Caracas 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello very good everyone I'm great one and 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.470
 I'm here in a video is not a gameplay 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.300
 nor tutorials how to solve a book or 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.460
 a grid as you want to call it 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.650
 found in park 4 I take them Juan 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.039
 for a couple of days and what I 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.109
 what happens is that basically 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.130
 when I'm walking around the trees 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.059
 I blinked 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.960
 and now it seems that now you see it 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.930
 blinking the world 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.670
 it's quite annoying and our 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.800
 prepare but they stay as planes 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 I have managed to find the solution to 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.719
 solutions installing a driver 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.640
 for nvidia for md i have also 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.829
 found that there is a driver in 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.449
 specific for frank and 4 I do not know if it's the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.610
 driver or solved for between but of 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.210
 I will also leave you in the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.430
 description 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.159
 I have a nvidia geforce gtx 760 the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.540
 overclocked version of series and in 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.790
 principle there had to be no 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.360
 problem but I've seen what happens more 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.429
 people and did not find any solution like that 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.080
 looking for a little bit and I found that 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:18.590
 there was a driver in this place fire week 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.070
 and nvidia 4 specifically is the 340 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.160
 and 4.75 whql but well that either 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.050
 it matters and as you see then the trees 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.050
 for a flat medium 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.009
 Hello 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.570
 OK 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 now install the driver and I will show you 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.810
 how is the result and how good it looks 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.560
 with him besides that not only that but 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.200
 optimize what it is 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.409
 the game itself you'll see that it works 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.409
 best 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.270
 Well, as you can see now 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.370
 same no longer fit the trees you see 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.020
 pretty good I do not have the graphics to 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.320
 ultra but that does not have to affect in 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.320
 nothing 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.560
 it seems that it is solved at all 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.130
 I had not tried it but if it works 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.360
 perfect and the trees look luxurious 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.070
 this probably the better the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.440
 you have better graphics you will see but 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.390
 now it looks perfect is a pass 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.210
 I hope you have served this video 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.040
 if it has served us to put in the 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.380
 comments to the best I can find 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.230
 some solution out there looking with 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.460
 some for English and such but I suppose 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.520
 that there should not be any problem 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.970
 plus 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.890
 and this game is amazing by the way if 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.840
 you want me to have some gameplay of 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.600
 the fall pea and you already know how to put it on 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.940
 the comments though I'm good 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.980
 playing quite and has not recorded anything and 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.200
 I'm dedicating myself to spend everything 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.860
 he is charming 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.720
 and nothing else I hope that it has served you 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:11.250
 this is this small solution that I bring you 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.250
 here and see you in more videos bye bye 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.310
