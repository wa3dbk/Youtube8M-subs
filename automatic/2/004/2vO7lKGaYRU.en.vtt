00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.620
 skyscrapers whether to live or work 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.650
 without elevators , nothing would work here 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.539
 There are around 600,000 elevators in there 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.430
 germany yet many people feel 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.100
 unsure in the moving cabins 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.019
 have fear the technology fails no 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.919
 reason to panic says through longer if 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.570
 you can see this plaque 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.669
 recognize if the elevator is checked 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.829
 recognizable is the sixth verified date 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.750
 and if the plaque is in the elevator 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.520
 one can be sure whoever sophies 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.859
 the last listener of us tested and 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.289
 can be safely used the 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.640
 regular inspection of lifts is 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.469
 legally required 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.019
 but the cabin can not 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.460
 but crash out or crash can 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.090
 actually only happen in film and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.980
 watch TV 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.390
 there is unlikely the elevator 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.910
 has a speed limiter here 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.879
 The block when the system too fast 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.579
 and then are fed to start the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.140
 Clamp the cabin, the test must 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.600
 from approved companies 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.370
 be carried out there longer check 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.010
 the entire technology door opener 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.119
 Guide rails gear rope systems 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.619
 Brake ventilation and the emergency call too 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.130
 Win commitments once a year 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.689
 check 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.640
 therefore it will be a big and a small one 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.380
 Examination alternating the big one 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.000
 Examination is all-encompassing with the whole 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.079
 safety devices and at the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.570
 do small exams because that 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.250
 most important as the doors of the emergency call 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.210
 all it is quite relevant in 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.670
 to ensure operation 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.920
 who drive the elevator on number sure 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.150
 wants to go find the exam plaque 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 right next to the control panel 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.150
 it can be independent of the exam 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 happen that a lift during the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.900
 ride stops that is annoying 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.180
 but usually not dangerous 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.040
 every car is in an emergency 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.619
 Button equipped also at 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.450
 Power failure, an alarm tone works 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.880
 informs the emergency service about a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.210
 intercom or a telephone contact 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.210
 picks up 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 then keep calm and wait 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.320
 usually one is after 30 at the latest 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 minutes again freely checked elevators 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.209
 bring one safely into the highest 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.190
 floors shorter distances one can 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.190
 but also for the sake of health
