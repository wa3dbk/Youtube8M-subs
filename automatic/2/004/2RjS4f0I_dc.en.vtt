00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
was using that for a very long period of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.780 
was using that for a very long period of
time<00:01:33.720> until<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.680> decided<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.310> would<00:01:35.369> join<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790

group and I made hero born skilled

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
group and I made hero born skilled
because<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> thought<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.670> had<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> ring<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
because I thought that had a ring to it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
because I thought that had a ring to it
but<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.159> started<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.340> feel<00:01:41.369> left<00:01:41.670> out

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but then I started to feel left out

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
but then I started to feel left out
because<00:01:42.000> he<00:01:42.570> didn't<00:01:42.840> follow<00:01:43.020> along<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> lines

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
because he didn't follow along the lines

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.530 
because he didn't follow along the lines
the<00:01:43.979> lines<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> whole<00:01:44.820> user<00:01:45.060> name<00:01:45.329> was

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the lines of that whole user name was

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.520 
the lines of that whole user name was
supposed<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.290> name<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.420> word<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
supposed to be a name or like a word and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.999 
supposed to be a name or like a word and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
then shot hero with two underscores so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.429 
then shot hero with two underscores so
mine<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> reversed<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.170> didn't

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
