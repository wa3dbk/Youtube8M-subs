00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.690 
white phone and my wife absolutely loves
this<00:00:45.120> case<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.600> far<00:00:45.739> just<00:00:46.739> had<00:00:46.860> these<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.190> last

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this case so far just had these on last

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.209 
this case so far just had these on last
night<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.960> far<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.559> scratching<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
night so as far as the scratching and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
night so as far as the scratching and
spidering<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.539> knicks<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.710> i

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
spidering you know the knicks on here i

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
spidering you know the knicks on here i
don't<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> many<00:00:53.520> yet<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.899> all

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
don't see that many yet but as we all

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.330 
don't see that many yet but as we all
know<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> darker<00:00:55.559> colors<00:00:55.590> tend<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.160> show<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
know the darker colors tend to show a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.910 
know the darker colors tend to show a
little<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.270> than<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> lighter<00:00:58.590> color

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
little bit more than the lighter color

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
little bit more than the lighter color
so<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> white<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.760> might<00:01:00.090> turn<00:01:00.270> out

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so the white actually might turn out

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
so the white actually might turn out
pretty<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:00.660> I've<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> check<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.350> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pretty well I've got to check out that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.630 
pretty well I've got to check out that
blue<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.699> looks<00:01:02.940> really<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.600> cool<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
blue that looks really really cool so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.000 
blue that looks really really cool so
what<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> mean<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> guys<00:01:06.689> of

course I'm given all five of these out

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.010 
course I'm given all five of these out
to<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> guys<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.600> I'm<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to you guys and I'm not going to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
to you guys and I'm not going to
necessarily<00:01:13.110> let<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> pick<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> color<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
necessarily let you pick a color that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
necessarily let you pick a color that
you<00:01:14.729> want<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> stick<00:01:16.770> somebody

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
you want I don't want to stick somebody

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.640 
you want I don't want to stick somebody
with<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> color<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:18.689> don't<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.380> or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
with a color that they don't want or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
with a color that they don't want or
don't<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.280> need<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:21.000> whatever<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> case

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
don't really need or whatever the case

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
don't really need or whatever the case
may<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.830> guess<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> best<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> do

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
may be so I guess the best way to do

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
may be so I guess the best way to do
this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:25.259> ahead<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.710> pick<00:01:26.220> five

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this is just go ahead and pick five

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
this is just go ahead and pick five
people<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.840> send<00:01:28.080> them<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.409> random

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
people and just send them out at random

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.310 
people and just send them out at random
now<00:01:29.280> obviously<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> female<00:01:31.020> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
now obviously if I do have a female that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
now obviously if I do have a female that
would<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> pink<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.759> have

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
would really like the pink and I have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.569 
would really like the pink and I have
four<00:01:33.329> other<00:01:33.479> guys<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.770> pretty

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
four other guys that when I'm pretty

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.370 
four other guys that when I'm pretty
sure<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.329> work<00:01:36.509> something<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:37.079> i<00:01:37.140> don't

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
sure we can work something out i don't

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.539 
sure we can work something out i don't
know<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> guy<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:37.890> necessarily<00:01:38.159> want

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
know if a guy would necessarily want

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
know if a guy would necessarily want
pink<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> there's
