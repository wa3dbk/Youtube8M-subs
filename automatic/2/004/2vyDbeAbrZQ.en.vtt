the<00:01:54.590> top<00:01:54.800> with<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.159> softer<00:01:55.670> side<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.300> my<00:01:56.870> file

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the top with the softer side of my file

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.350 
the top with the softer side of my file
so<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.130> could<00:01:58.250> move<00:01:58.640> around<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.150> edges

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
so that I could move around the edges

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.010 
so that I could move around the edges
and<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.500> just<00:02:00.740> gently<00:02:01.610> file<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.750> off

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.440 
and I just gently file all of that off
the<00:02:03.290> top<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.860> again<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.729> really<00:02:05.060> get<00:02:05.240> down<00:02:05.390> to

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
the top and again I really get down to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.960 
the top and again I really get down to
the<00:02:05.690> nitty<00:02:06.050> gritty<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.580> side<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.729> is

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the nitty gritty on the side and that is

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.959 
the nitty gritty on the side and that is
how<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.209> do<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.109> lace<00:02:12.349> nail<00:02:12.790> now<00:02:13.790> these
