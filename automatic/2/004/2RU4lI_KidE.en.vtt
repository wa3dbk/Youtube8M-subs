00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.700
 Hello 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.860
 Andrei Tkachenko and today's 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.050
 the theme for our video is air 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.960
 breathability of our food is 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.259
 there is in the literature very often describe 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.890
 what if you have a deep litter feed 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:30.259
 if there is a lot of straw and there is 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.980
 heap natural aeration then not 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.380
 sure there are some roles there 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.190
 loosening or puncturing 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.420
 but we must always remember that manure 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.450
 there is dung he doesn't care 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.940
 settled and opinion layers 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.980
 where there will not get oxygen that's when 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.020
 Here we have a bunch of 30 centimeters if 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.550
 oxygen will not reach to the bottom here in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.590
 the bottom layer there conditionally is five to ten 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.930
 centimeters above the ground 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.930
 daughter just do not recycle they 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.600
 drag in the worm breathes through the skin he 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.299
 draws oxygen in all the body 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 so the most important thing to do 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.890
 you need to make villas of course 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 special views for what and island 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.079
 which but relatively speaking derzhak and three 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.090
 thick hold NER 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.090
 they pierce that is derzhak should 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.749
 be up to 5 centimeters thick and a challenge 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.149
 simple 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.100
 we have to pierce me 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.850
 pointed at the end we have to pierce 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.069
 so that we get to the bottom 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.130
 that is, here we took the conditional straight line to 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:39.829
 3 whole heaps and pierces to the very bottom 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.399
 Retreat 25-30 centimeters is easy 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.529
 palm we have 20 cm 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.899
 25-30 retreat and again on all new 

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:51.469
 pierce the colitis so hard 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.770
 so that you really get to the bottom 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.069
 pierced to air completely 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.349
 did you pass oxygen intake not 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.610
 prevented 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.490
 that is 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.350
 this little nuance is for one thing 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.020
 uncomplicated and on the other hand all that is not 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.360
 will be processed then just ferment 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.360
 then just be bent and when you already 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.990
 stock leave give people here these 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.210
 the particles 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.450
 will ruin your whole image ie these 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.060
 the particles will start to get angry 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.390
 and subsequently those people who bought from 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.340
 you this runner is always where my compost 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.920
 you will no longer be contacted 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.630
 handle something from all my accents 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.230
 videos it is in the nuances 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.140
 the nuances of not having any 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.360
 video in the complex I can not all everything 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.950
 put nuances in one place because 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.750
 nobody this video will be beacon 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.100
 the task lasts for hours today 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.970
 probably all the same video is already exhausted 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.680
 start the air while watering 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.890
 keep the temperature thermometers 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.340
 we check 25 26 degrees daily 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.680
 that is, preferably thermometers should 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.500
 be soil up to eighty degrees 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.870
 and every day control control control 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 control one day skip and all 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.290
 may die on it probably on 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.390
 today everything 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.870
 health and happiness are our destiny 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.870
 dating
