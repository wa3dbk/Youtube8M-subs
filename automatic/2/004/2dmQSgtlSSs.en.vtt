unfortunately<00:00:01.199> things<00:00:01.680> don't<00:00:02.040> always<00:00:02.220> go

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
unfortunately things don't always go

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.120 
unfortunately things don't always go
well<00:00:02.970> for<00:00:03.270> breast<00:00:03.990> augmentation<00:00:04.319> patients

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
well for breast augmentation patients

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.789 
well for breast augmentation patients
and<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.910> have<00:00:06.029> had<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.720> pleasure<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.170> treating

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
and I have had the pleasure of treating

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.470 
and I have had the pleasure of treating
some<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.160> these<00:00:08.280> women<00:00:08.670> who<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:09.330> had

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
some of these women who have had

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
some of these women who have had
horrible<00:00:09.929> terrible<00:00:10.559> results<00:00:11.040> things<00:00:11.219> that

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
horrible terrible results things that

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.900 
horrible terrible results things that
they<00:00:11.429> would<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.700> never<00:00:11.880> expected<00:00:12.259> to<00:00:13.910> there

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
they would have never expected to there

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.990 
they would have never expected to there
are<00:00:15.000> several<00:00:15.269> reasons<00:00:15.389> why<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.990> occurs<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
are several reasons why this occurs and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.550 
are several reasons why this occurs and
they<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.119> typically<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.289> several

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
from one breast to the other there are

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
from one breast to the other there are
also<00:00:29.279> problems<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:30.269> placement<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.199> the

parents of the implant let me first
start<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.680> most<00:00:37.980> common<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
start with the most common one and that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.500 
start with the most common one and that
is<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.719> patients<00:00:40.649> who<00:00:41.180> dissatisfied<00:00:42.180> with

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is that patients who dissatisfied with

is that patients who dissatisfied with
the<00:00:43.020> size<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.620> asymmetry<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.430> their<00:00:44.879> breast

the size or asymmetry of their breast

the size or asymmetry of their breast
implants<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> probably<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> most

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
implants this is probably the most

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
implants this is probably the most
common<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> quite<00:00:49.559> frankly<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
common thing I see and quite frankly I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
common thing I see and quite frankly I
believe<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:51.239> inadequate<00:00:52.079> amount<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
believe is just an inadequate amount of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010 
believe is just an inadequate amount of
time<00:00:52.739> spent<00:00:52.910> between<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.239> surgeon<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
time spent between the surgeon and the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.680 
time spent between the surgeon and the
patient<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.010> very<00:00:56.250> unfortunate<00:00:56.640> i<00:00:57.090> find

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
patient which is very unfortunate i find

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
patient which is very unfortunate i find
it<00:00:57.809> also<00:00:58.199> particularly<00:00:58.620> disturbing<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it also particularly disturbing that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360 
it also particularly disturbing that
some<00:01:00.270> plastic<00:01:00.750> surgeons<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.680> arrogant<00:01:01.890> as

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
some plastic surgeons are so arrogant as

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
some plastic surgeons are so arrogant as
to<00:01:02.430> decide<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.239> implant<00:01:03.629> size<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.229> their

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
to decide the implant size for their

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.980 
to decide the implant size for their
patients<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.270> absolutely

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
patients I think this is an absolutely

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.859 
patients I think this is an absolutely
horrible<00:01:07.590> thing<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.220> when<00:01:09.210> patients<00:01:09.720> ask

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
horrible thing to do when patients ask

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
horrible thing to do when patients ask
me<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.320> opinion<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:11.010> basically<00:01:11.790> tell<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.090> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
me my opinion I basically tell them that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
me my opinion I basically tell them that
I'm<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> last<00:01:12.840> person<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.439> should<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I'm the last person they should be

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.580 
I'm the last person they should be
asking<00:01:14.330> implant<00:01:15.330> size<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.320> specific

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
asking implant size is a very specific

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
asking implant size is a very specific
question<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.369> very<00:01:17.610> personal<00:01:18.119> question<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
question a very personal question that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
question a very personal question that
they<00:01:19.170> need<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:20.100> come<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.909> an

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
they need to really come up with an

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.929 
they need to really come up with an
answer<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.330> their<00:01:21.689> own<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.920> surgeon<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
answer on their own as the surgeon it is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.630 
answer on their own as the surgeon it is
my<00:01:24.150> job<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.810> place<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> implants<00:01:26.130> perfectly

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
my job to place the implants perfectly

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.390 
my job to place the implants perfectly
so<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.270> look<00:01:27.540> natural<00:01:27.810> soft<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.860> symmetric

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so they look natural soft and symmetric

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700 
so they look natural soft and symmetric
but<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> rely<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.600> patients<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> choose<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
but I rely on my patients to choose the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.010 
but I rely on my patients to choose the
size<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> look<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
size and the look that they want the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.319 
size and the look that they want the
other<00:01:34.320> issue<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> symmetry<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
other issue that I see is a symmetry and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.670 
other issue that I see is a symmetry and
size<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:37.310> find<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.939> surgeons<00:01:39.450> used<00:01:39.869> two

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
size I find that some surgeons used two

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
size I find that some surgeons used two
different<00:01:40.979> sized<00:01:41.430> implants<00:01:42.060> when<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
different sized implants when it's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020 
different sized implants when it's
always<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.930> necessary<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.130> find

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
always not necessary to do so I find

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
always not necessary to do so I find
that<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.420> women<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.350> differences<00:01:47.340> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that all women have some differences in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.289 
that all women have some differences in
breast<00:01:47.970> shape<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> size<00:01:49.280> however<00:01:50.299> implants

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
breast shape and size however implants

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
breast shape and size however implants
vary<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.890> make<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.729> small<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
vary as well when you make as small as a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.380 
vary as well when you make as small as a
25<00:01:54.780> cc<00:01:55.259> change<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.549> type<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> implant<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
25 cc change in the type of implant the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.450 
25 cc change in the type of implant the
diameter<00:01:57.899> changes<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.890> projection

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
diameter changes and the projection

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030 
diameter changes and the projection
changes<00:01:59.820> as<00:01:59.969> well<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.450> find<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.590> much<00:02:01.799> better

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
changes as well I find it's much better

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.429 
changes as well I find it's much better
to<00:02:02.189> shape<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.759> breasts<00:02:03.030> by<00:02:03.270> removing<00:02:03.630> some

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
to shape the breasts by removing some

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.560 
to shape the breasts by removing some
breast<00:02:04.740> tissue<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.340> both<00:02:05.579> improve<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.299> size

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
breast tissue to both improve the size

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.260 
breast tissue to both improve the size
difference<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.890> also<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.729> shape<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
difference and also the shape of the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
difference and also the shape of the
breast<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> same<00:02:11.009> size

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
breast and then use the same size

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.160 
breast and then use the same size
implant

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
implant

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.260

only in rare situations where i feel

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.059 
only in rare situations where i feel

that i'm unable to properly shape and

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.650 
that i'm unable to properly shape and
reduce<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.670> breast<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.120> match<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.540> the

reduce one breast to match it to the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.510 
reduce one breast to match it to the
other<00:02:17.870> will<00:02:18.560> i<00:02:18.590> use<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> different<00:02:19.370> sized

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
other will i use a different sized

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.059 
other will i use a different sized
implant<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:21.080> next<00:02:21.410> problem<00:02:21.590> i'd<00:02:21.800> like<00:02:21.950> to

talk about is placement problems this is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.030 
talk about is placement problems this is
usually<00:02:25.819> an<00:02:26.330> occurrence<00:02:27.170> when<00:02:27.380> one<00:02:27.620> implant

implant itself where you have the
fullness<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.630> implant<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.260> then<00:03:27.590> the

fullness of the breast on top of it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.979

hence the name the other problem that

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.530 
hence the name the other problem that
occurs<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.500> when<00:03:34.070> implants<00:03:34.609> are<00:03:34.730> put<00:03:34.970> too<00:03:35.269> far

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
occurs is when implants are put too far

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.660 
occurs is when implants are put too far
apart<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:36.799> is<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:36.980> horrible<00:03:37.609> situation

this<00:03:44.510> is<00:03:44.690> when<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.930> pocket<00:03:45.109> has<00:03:45.350> made<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:45.859> far

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
this is when the pocket has made so far

situation<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.780> something<00:03:57.560> where<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:58.670> implant

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
situation is something where the implant

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.090 
situation is something where the implant

complications<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.560> breast<00:04:06.829> implants<00:04:07.220> but

complications of breast implants but

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.789 
complications of breast implants but
they<00:04:08.060> can<00:04:08.239> all<00:04:08.359> be<00:04:08.389> fixed<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.049> these<00:04:09.440> are<00:04:09.620> all

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
they can all be fixed and these are all

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.580 
they can all be fixed and these are all
situations<00:04:10.489> I've<00:04:10.639> seen<00:04:10.940> many<00:04:11.750> times<00:04:12.079> and<00:04:12.380> have

had the pleasure of fixing and the

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.479 
had the pleasure of fixing and the
reason<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.680> such<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:15.980> pleasure<00:04:16.280> is

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
reason this is such a pleasure is

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.449 
reason this is such a pleasure is
because<00:04:16.870> typically<00:04:17.870> when<00:04:18.620> women<00:04:18.950> come<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.280> see

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
they feel depressed this is the Lessing

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.050 
they feel depressed this is the Lessing
that<00:04:23.840> they<00:04:23.990> wanted<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:25.130> by<00:04:25.310> being<00:04:25.729> a

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
that they wanted but by being a

that they wanted but by being a
to<00:04:26.270> correct<00:04:26.660> this<00:04:26.810> problem<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.530> give<00:04:28.130> me<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
to correct this problem and give me the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.070 
to correct this problem and give me the
breast<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.820> they<00:04:28.940> had<00:04:29.090> hope<00:04:29.300> for<00:04:29.330> originally

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
probably the most dreaded one because it

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.279 
probably the most dreaded one because it
happens<00:06:19.280> with<00:06:19.460> relatively<00:06:20.419> higher<00:06:20.720> frequency

happens with relatively higher frequency

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.010 
happens with relatively higher frequency
is<00:06:21.440> that<00:06:21.620> of<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.830> contracture<00:06:23.020> contractures

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
is that of a contracture contractures

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.460 
is that of a contracture contractures
occur<00:06:24.520> for<00:06:25.520> no<00:06:25.700> reason<00:06:26.090> we<00:06:26.870> don't<00:06:26.990> know<00:06:27.229> why

occur for no reason we don't know why

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.200 
occur for no reason we don't know why
they<00:06:27.710> occur<00:06:28.010> but<00:06:28.190> we<00:06:28.340> do<00:06:28.580> know<00:06:28.789> that<00:06:28.820> certain

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
they occur but we do know that certain

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.690 
they occur but we do know that certain
things<00:06:29.630> influence<00:06:30.560> them<00:06:30.740> we<00:06:31.340> know<00:06:31.520> the

putting the implant under the muscle

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.560 
putting the implant under the muscle
reduces<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:33.979> risk<00:06:34.159> of<00:06:34.250> contracture<00:06:34.820> we<00:06:35.330> also

reduces the risk of contracture we also

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.860 
reduces the risk of contracture we also

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
know that using a textured implant

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.930 
know that using a textured implant
reduces<00:06:38.320> the<00:06:38.470> risk<00:06:38.650> of<00:06:38.770> contracture<00:06:39.400> what

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
reduces the risk of contracture what

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.260 
reduces the risk of contracture what

process in a very small percentage and I

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.400 
process in a very small percentage and I
should<00:07:03.910> point<00:07:04.060> out<00:07:04.210> that<00:07:04.270> in<00:07:04.570> my<00:07:04.690> practice<00:07:04.960> and

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
should point out that in my practice and

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.950 
should point out that in my practice and
now<00:07:05.560> over<00:07:06.030> 6,000<00:07:07.030> breast<00:07:07.240> implants<00:07:07.720> I've<00:07:07.810> only

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
now over 6,000 breast implants I've only

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.730 
now over 6,000 breast implants I've only
had<00:07:08.140> 24<00:07:08.590> contractures<00:07:10.140> this<00:07:11.140> capsule

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
had 24 contractures this capsule

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.250 
had 24 contractures this capsule
essentially<00:07:12.310> squeezes<00:07:12.820> itself<00:07:13.210> and<00:07:13.480> this

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
essentially squeezes itself and this

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.440 
essentially squeezes itself and this
creates<00:07:14.590> a<00:07:14.680> very<00:07:15.010> firm<00:07:15.400> miss<00:07:15.910> shape<00:07:16.210> and

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
creates a very firm miss shape and

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.280 
creates a very firm miss shape and
unnatural<00:07:16.990> sometimes<00:07:17.440> painful<00:07:18.040> breast<00:07:19.290> once

unnatural sometimes painful breast once

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.650 
unnatural sometimes painful breast once
this<00:07:20.470> occurs<00:07:20.530> I<00:07:21.220> found<00:07:21.760> the<00:07:22.000> only<00:07:22.330> treatment

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
this occurs I found the only treatment

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.610 
this occurs I found the only treatment
is<00:07:23.520> surgical<00:07:24.870> what<00:07:25.870> I've<00:07:26.050> done<00:07:26.080> in<00:07:26.470> those

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
is surgical what I've done in those

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.850 
is surgical what I've done in those
situations<00:07:27.250> I've<00:07:27.400> gone<00:07:27.580> back<00:07:27.820> in<00:07:28.140> removed<00:07:29.140> the

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
situations I've gone back in removed the

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.130 
situations I've gone back in removed the
shell<00:07:30.250> or<00:07:30.520> the<00:07:30.910> capsule<00:07:31.390> completely<00:07:31.900> and

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.140 
shell or the capsule completely and

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.320 
shell or the capsule completely and
replace<00:07:33.100> the<00:07:33.310> implant<00:07:33.730> with<00:07:33.910> a<00:07:33.940> textured

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
replace the implant with a textured

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.840 
replace the implant with a textured
implant<00:07:34.810> and<00:07:35.080> so<00:07:35.740> far<00:07:36.010> I've<00:07:36.130> had<00:07:36.310> a<00:07:36.520> hundred

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:36.850 
implant and so far I've had a hundred

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.270 
implant and so far I've had a hundred
percent<00:07:36.970> success<00:07:37.390> rate<00:07:37.720> in<00:07:38.440> treating

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
percent success rate in treating

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.180 
percent success rate in treating
patients<00:07:39.730> who<00:07:40.420> have<00:07:40.600> come<00:07:40.840> to<00:07:40.990> me<00:07:41.110> from<00:07:41.860> other

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.190 
patients who have come to me from other

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.850 
patients who have come to me from other
areas<00:07:42.670> I<00:07:43.060> find<00:07:43.720> the<00:07:43.870> most<00:07:44.020> common<00:07:44.530> reason<00:07:44.830> for

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
areas I find the most common reason for

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.010 
areas I find the most common reason for
contracture<00:07:45.520> is<00:07:45.640> an<00:07:46.150> implant<00:07:46.540> that<00:07:46.660> is<00:07:46.810> placed

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.020 
contracture is an implant that is placed

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.500 
contracture is an implant that is placed
on<00:07:47.230> top<00:07:47.410> of<00:07:47.590> the<00:07:47.650> muscle<00:07:47.830> in<00:07:48.640> those<00:07:48.850> situations

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.510 
on top of the muscle in those situations

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.600 
on top of the muscle in those situations
I<00:07:49.570> do<00:07:49.630> not<00:07:49.900> use<00:07:50.110> a<00:07:50.140> textured<00:07:50.650> implant<00:07:51.010> I<00:07:51.190> still

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.610 
I do not use a textured implant I still

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.520 
I do not use a textured implant I still
prefer<00:07:51.760> to<00:07:52.030> use<00:07:52.150> a<00:07:52.180> smooth<00:07:52.510> implant<00:07:52.960> but

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:53.530 
prefer to use a smooth implant but

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.290 
prefer to use a smooth implant but
simply<00:07:53.920> by<00:07:54.070> placing<00:07:54.130> the<00:07:54.640> implant<00:07:55.030> from<00:07:55.060> on

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300 
simply by placing the implant from on

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.600
