00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
you know I can make a mall this is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.120 
you know I can make a mall this is
pretty<00:05:01.750> simple<00:05:02.080> pretty<00:05:02.410> much<00:05:02.620> as<00:05:02.770> simple<00:05:02.920> as

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
pretty simple pretty much as simple as

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.100 
pretty simple pretty much as simple as
it<00:05:03.280> gets<00:05:03.310> really<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:04.090> can<00:05:04.510> simplify<00:05:04.750> some<00:05:05.050> of

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
it gets really I can simplify some of

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.900 
it gets really I can simplify some of
those<00:05:05.170> steps<00:05:05.350> later<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:06.040> really<00:05:06.610> wanted<00:05:06.820> to

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
those steps later I really wanted to

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.940 
those steps later I really wanted to
show<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.240> as<00:05:07.360> simple<00:05:08.140> as<00:05:08.290> possible<00:05:08.770> in<00:05:08.920> case

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
show it as simple as possible in case

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.210 
show it as simple as possible in case
you<00:05:09.400> are<00:05:09.580> inexperienced<00:05:10.210> with<00:05:11.220> technical

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
you are inexperienced with technical

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.220 
you are inexperienced with technical
type<00:05:12.460> things<00:05:12.760> which<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.420> really<00:05:13.630> technical

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
type things which is really technical

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.930 
type things which is really technical
but<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.560> just<00:05:14.890> wanted<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:15.160> make<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.280> as<00:05:15.430> basic<00:05:15.850> as

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
but I just wanted to make it as basic as

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.640 
but I just wanted to make it as basic as
possible<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:16.450> later<00:05:16.930> I'll<00:05:17.260> make<00:05:17.410> a<00:05:17.440> more

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
possible so later I'll make a more

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.380 
possible so later I'll make a more
