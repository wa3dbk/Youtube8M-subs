00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello everyone, are you on the channel Eternal Summer and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.390
 this issue we will tell you about our 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.940
 new acquisition 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 honda pcx in general for what we bought there 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 bike well first of all to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 go somewhere far for example when we 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.480
 went to the zoo kao keo 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.640
 go there only 50 60 kilometers then we 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920
 very tired on the road and felt something 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 that the usual bike is not intended then 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 so here somewhere far away he 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.289
 not steady enough on 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 bumps bounces on speed leads 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.390
 not very confident and inventory xXx 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.000
 wider tires reinforced 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.690
 shock absorbers 2 seats 1 therefore on bumps 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 he does not beat more soft bumps in his back 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.750
 it is very nice when there is eternal 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.450
 comfortable tales not so on it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 very comfortable to go somewhere far for 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.199
 trips around my city will also 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 and use me as a passenger on it 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.670
 love to ride which is the first time 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.520
 swept on the piss it was not our pisik 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.649
 I did not like it very much 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.420
 surely does not consider you from the side 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
 the side on the tips doesn't hit you 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 spine and that's very cool to me he 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.990
 really like and not like him 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710
 Looks like external we bought this bike about 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 Russians 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.790
 for 1000 dollars made out my 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.299
 but literally a few hours before driving 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.700
 in traffic police 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.180
 there is very fast re-registering the bike is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.490
 takes literally 2-3 hours and documents 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 already ready how much is reissue 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.150
 and where to do it but reissue we 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.479
 did in traffic police 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.579
 it cost us literally 200 300 baht 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 Ah two bikes very large roomy 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.390
 trunk therefore need to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.180
 external trunk disappears here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.250
 that's all we need and fits 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.450
 products can fit and what else 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.759
 shopping let's see here and so 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.759
 the trunk looks calm here 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.850
 the helmet is placed and other things that 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 Here is an example of a store bought here from us 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.460
 checkup for this year and still here 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.560
 additional lock which we can 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.640
 lock the wheels to not hijacked 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.740
 bike also in the tank there is an alarm on 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 key from 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.120
 there is a keychain and you can enable and disable 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.850
 signaling 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.640
 now I turned on the alarm and there 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.060
 the red light will flash if here 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.280
 press that is, the alarm goes off 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 when you turn plus to 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.110
 turn on running here is very beautiful 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.400
 the arrow is spinning like on machines also 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.370
 there is a function on this tank 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.550
 fuel economy is called she and dlink 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.460
 stop that is when you stop 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.000
 at a crossroads stalls after three seconds 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.850
 engine and you can start it with 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.980
 using gas pressure is technology 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.500
 can significantly save gasoline 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.900
 at the crossroads when you stand at the traffic lights 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.050
 and she reacts very quickly when you 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.450
 going to go but most of all in 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.210
 this bike I like his face 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.460
 look like she is pretty very cool 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.820
 It looks very and so greyhound 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.440
 10 2 turn signals and headlight bike 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.530
 quite voluminous 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.500
 he is more than ordinary tales he is wider and 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.990
 longer and due to this you yourself on it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.170
 you feel more confident 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.390
 balanced and more serious because 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.450
 that you seem to have been on such a 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.160
 a great motorcycle is a feeling of course 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.200
 completely different than going to the usual 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.980
 tales so let's take a ride on 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.720
 bike see how it works include 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 we got going 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.909
 it starts very cool 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.530
 very good engine acceleration 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.060
 four stroke injection and stands 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.060
 electronic fuel injection system 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.310
 he 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.790
 I hope that in this century we have a lot where 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.430
