00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.340 
for your cellular phone let's talk about
the<00:00:14.639> gameplay<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.540> initial<00:00:15.839> thoughts<00:00:16.109> about

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the gameplay my initial thoughts about

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.040 
the gameplay my initial thoughts about
this<00:00:16.529> game<00:00:16.740> was<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.100> wow<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.270> sucks<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.869> AI

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
this game was like wow this sucks the AI

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
this game was like wow this sucks the AI
is<00:00:19.260> impossible<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> beat<00:00:20.250> sometimes<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> just

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
is impossible to beat sometimes it just

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.700 
is impossible to beat sometimes it just
beat<00:00:21.240> down<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.020> can't<00:00:22.260> even<00:00:22.410> do

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
beat down on you and you can't even do

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.870 
beat down on you and you can't even do
anything<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
anything about it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.970 
anything about it
but<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.539> after<00:00:24.840> playing<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.740> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
but then after playing it for a bit I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.970 
but then after playing it for a bit I
learned<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> AI<00:00:26.970> sucks<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.740> just

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
learned that the AI sucks and it just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580 
learned that the AI sucks and it just
really<00:00:29.250> cheap<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> stupid<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:31.080> controls<00:00:31.470> are

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
really cheap and stupid the controls are

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.680 
really cheap and stupid the controls are
very<00:00:31.619> minimal<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.520> game<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.210> only<00:00:33.360> have

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
very minimal in this game you only have

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 
very minimal in this game you only have
one<00:00:34.350> punch<00:00:34.800> slash<00:00:35.340> kick<00:00:35.760> button<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
one punch slash kick button and the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.060 
one punch slash kick button and the
other<00:00:36.989> button<00:00:37.410> does<00:00:38.219> grabs<00:00:39.320> pins<00:00:40.320> some

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
other button does grabs pins some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.850 
other button does grabs pins some
missions<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.360> goes<00:00:42.719> outside<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> ring<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
missions it goes outside the ring it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
missions it goes outside the ring it
picks<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.340> weapons<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.270> climbs<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
picks up weapons it climbs the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
picks up weapons it climbs the
turnbuckle<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:47.879> finishing

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
turnbuckle and it will do your finishing

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.840 
turnbuckle and it will do your finishing
move<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.129> limits<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.730> can

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
move so this really limits what you can

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
move so this really limits what you can
do<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> game<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.840> seeing<00:00:52.680> how<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
do in the game really seeing how you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.000 
do in the game really seeing how you
only<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.340> two<00:00:53.579> action<00:00:54.360> buttons<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
only have two action buttons but and the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
only have two action buttons but and the
grappling<00:00:56.340> system<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.480> very<00:00:57.870> weird<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
grappling system is also very weird you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
grappling system is also very weird you
get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.100> bar<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.550> pops<00:00:59.730> up<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
get a little bar that pops up with a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
get a little bar that pops up with a
green<00:01:00.780> yellow<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.410> red<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> have

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
green yellow and red and then you have

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.750 
green yellow and red and then you have
to<00:01:02.879> line<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.229> green<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.549> win

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to line it up in the green and you win

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
to line it up in the green and you win
the<00:01:05.790> grapple<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> yellow<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the grapple if you go in the yellow that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.880 
the grapple if you go in the yellow that
grapple<00:01:08.670> breaks<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.380> land<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
grapple breaks up and if you land in the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.719 
grapple breaks up and if you land in the
red<00:01:11.810> he<00:01:12.810> bruins<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.439> grapple<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.430> seems

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
red he bruins the grapple it seems

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.109 
red he bruins the grapple it seems
really<00:01:15.030> random<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> win<00:01:17.119> sometimes

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really random how you win sometimes

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
really random how you win sometimes
you'll<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.330> overpower<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> sometimes

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you'll just overpower them and sometimes

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.910 
you'll just overpower them and sometimes
they'll<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> best<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.920> it's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
they'll just get the best of you it's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
they'll just get the best of you it's
time<00:01:23.310> based<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.170> could<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.409> not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
time based as well so you could just not

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
time based as well so you could just not
even<00:01:26.100> touch<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
even touch it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
even touch it
for<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> good<00:01:27.630> long<00:01:27.840> time<00:01:27.869> until<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.710> gets<00:01:28.890> near

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
for a good long time until it gets near

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
for a good long time until it gets near
the<00:01:29.250> end<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.909> try<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> land

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the end and then you try to make it land

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
the end and then you try to make it land
near<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> green<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.430> flawed<00:01:32.790> design

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
near the green it's a very flawed design

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
near the green it's a very flawed design
I<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:34.020> understand<00:01:34.560> why<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:34.890> went<00:01:35.130> with

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
I don't understand why they went with

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.840 
I don't understand why they went with
this<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.930> good<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.640> two

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this but it's all good you have two

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.880 
this but it's all good you have two
modes<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> choose<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
modes that you can choose from which is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.160 
modes that you can choose from which is
championship<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.759> versus<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.600> within<00:01:42.869> those

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
championship and versus and within those

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.800 
championship and versus and within those
two<00:01:43.380> modes<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.189> match<00:01:44.460> pipes<00:01:44.850> which

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
two modes you have to match pipes which

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.770 
two modes you have to match pipes which
is<00:01:46.049> normal<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> hardcore<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.640> lacking<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.630> lot

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
is normal and hardcore so lacking a lot

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.770 
is normal and hardcore so lacking a lot
of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.759> console<00:01:50.759> features<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.420> guess<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of the console features I guess you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.410 
of the console features I guess you
could<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.079> saying<00:01:52.320> could<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.369> least

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
could be saying could have at least

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.080 
could be saying could have at least
added<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.540> don't<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> cage<00:01:55.110> match<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
added I don't know a cage match or

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.639 
added I don't know a cage match or
whatever<00:01:57.090> else<00:01:57.719> and<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:01.259> game<00:02:01.500> also

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
whatever else and this game also
