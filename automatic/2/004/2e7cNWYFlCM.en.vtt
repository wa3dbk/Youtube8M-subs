00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
is that you have to tune it before you

is that you have to tune it before you
can<00:00:25.769> start<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:27.080> tuning<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.380> an<00:00:28.500> advanced

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
how to generally get it in tune and if

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.819 
how to generally get it in tune and if
you're<00:00:45.030> still<00:00:45.329> finding<00:00:45.600> frustration<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you're still finding frustration with it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
you're still finding frustration with it
then<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.730> best<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.390> find<00:00:48.780> a

your violin luckily the one I'm showing

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.859 
your violin luckily the one I'm showing
you<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.580> today<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.560> tune<00:01:28.860> if

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
you on today it's not way out of tune if

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
you on today it's not way out of tune if
yours<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.829> example<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> strings<00:01:32.970> are

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
yours is for example if the strings are

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
yours is for example if the strings are
really<00:01:33.210> flappy<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> loose<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:35.189> you'll<00:01:35.310> want

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really flappy and loose then you'll want

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
really flappy and loose then you'll want
to<00:01:35.520> start<00:01:35.850> by<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.360> tightening<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to start by just tightening all the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.300 
to start by just tightening all the
strings<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:39.439> random<00:01:40.439> amount<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
strings a random amount just so that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
strings a random amount just so that
there<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:41.790> tension<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> strings<00:01:42.750> on

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
there is some tension on the strings on

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
there is some tension on the strings on
the<00:01:43.079> bridge<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:44.070> start<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> tune<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the bridge and then start to tune the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
the bridge and then start to tune the
strings<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> time<00:01:45.659> beginning<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
strings one at a time beginning with the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
strings one at a time beginning with the
a<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:48.710> you'll<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a and you'll want to have some kind of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280 
a and you'll want to have some kind of
device<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.220> give<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.850> an<00:01:54.090> A<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
device to give you an A and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.260 
device to give you an A and
going<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.500> use<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.100> tuner

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.000 

if<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.810> don't<00:01:59.990> have<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.200> tuner<00:02:00.470> then<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.830> can

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
if you don't have a tuner then you can

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.030 
if you don't have a tuner then you can
use<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:02.260> I'll<00:02:03.260> give<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> little<00:02:03.799> chunk

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.330 

and<00:02:10.300> now<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:10.930> going<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> tune<00:02:11.380> my<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.980> match

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and now I'm going to tune my a to match

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.110 
and now I'm going to tune my a to match
this<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:14.560> what<00:02:14.710> I'm<00:02:14.800> going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> do<00:02:15.190> once<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
this a now what I'm going to do once I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.240 
this a now what I'm going to do once I
once<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:17.080> turn<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.590> tuner<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.190> I'm

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
once I turn on the tuner so that I'm

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.820 
once I turn on the tuner so that I'm
getting<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.640> pure<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.330> tone<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.810> my<00:02:19.900> ear<00:02:20.140> I'm

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
getting that pure a tone in my ear I'm

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.470 
getting that pure a tone in my ear I'm
going<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> play<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.490> string<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:21.970> my<00:02:22.090> violin

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
going to play the a string on my violin

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.830 
going to play the a string on my violin
and<00:02:22.540> ask<00:02:22.840> myself<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.650> my<00:02:24.160> string<00:02:24.640> higher<00:02:25.390> or

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and ask myself is my string higher or

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.460 
and ask myself is my string higher or
lower<00:02:26.410> than<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.820> note<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.870> I'm<00:02:28.960> hearing<00:02:29.320> on

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
lower than the note that I'm hearing on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.060 
lower than the note that I'm hearing on
the<00:02:29.500> tuner<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.100> if<00:02:30.670> you're<00:02:30.850> really<00:02:31.180> not<00:02:31.360> sure

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
the tuner and if you're really not sure

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.100 
the tuner and if you're really not sure
then<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:33.550> tune<00:02:34.030> your<00:02:34.330> then<00:02:34.570> loosen<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
then just tune your then loosen the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.650 
then just tune your then loosen the
string<00:02:35.440> until<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.920> definitely<00:02:36.610> lower<00:02:36.880> than

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
string until it's definitely lower than

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
string until it's definitely lower than
the<00:02:37.810> tuner<00:02:38.170> note<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:39.250> bring<00:02:39.550> it<00:02:39.670> up

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the tuner note and then bring it up

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.070 
the tuner note and then bring it up
until<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.240> can<00:02:40.360> hear<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.750> that's<00:02:40.900> what<00:02:40.990> I'm

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
until you can hear it so that's what I'm

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.840 
until you can hear it so that's what I'm
going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.410> now<00:02:41.590> no<00:02:41.770> matter<00:02:41.890> what<00:02:42.160> no<00:02:42.790> matter

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
going to do now no matter what no matter

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.670 
going to do now no matter what no matter
what<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.360> actually<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> case<00:02:44.080> I'm<00:02:44.320> going<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
what is actually the case I'm going to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.500 
what is actually the case I'm going to
drop<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.160> string<00:02:45.190> below<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.330> then

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
drop the string below the a and then

00:02:46.510 --> 00:03:12.960 
drop the string below the a and then
bring<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.140> it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.600 

so<00:03:13.970> now<00:03:14.090> we<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.810> tune<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.610> I'm

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
so now we have the a in tune and I'm

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.690 
so now we have the a in tune and I'm
going<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.850> check<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.920> by<00:03:18.920> going<00:03:19.100> back<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
going to check it by going back to the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.970 
going to check it by going back to the
other<00:03:19.880> mode<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.390> tuner<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.920> instead<00:03:21.920> of

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
other mode of the tuner that instead of

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.220 
other mode of the tuner that instead of
giving<00:03:22.310> me<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.580> sound<00:03:22.910> will<00:03:23.330> actually<00:03:23.780> read<00:03:24.050> the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
giving me a sound will actually read the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.910 
giving me a sound will actually read the
note<00:03:25.300> that's<00:03:26.300> less<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.660> D<00:03:26.780> string<00:03:26.990> up<00:03:27.200> C<00:03:29.920> and

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
note that's less the D string up C and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.330 
note that's less the D string up C and
as<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.970> two<00:03:32.270> is<00:03:32.330> testing<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:34.040> pretty

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
as the two is testing it it's pretty

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.220 
as the two is testing it it's pretty
close<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.850> an<00:03:34.970> A<00:03:35.120> now<00:03:35.660> I'm<00:03:35.780> not<00:03:35.900> going<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.110> try

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
close to an A now I'm not going to try

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.110 
close to an A now I'm not going to try
to<00:03:36.290> get<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.590> perfect<00:03:36.980> right<00:03:37.160> now<00:03:37.340> because<00:03:37.610> when

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
to get it perfect right now because when

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.690 
to get it perfect right now because when
I<00:03:38.150> change<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> other<00:03:38.870> strings<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.740> tune<00:03:40.520> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
I change the other strings and tune the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.280 
I change the other strings and tune the
other<00:03:40.730> strings<00:03:40.970> that's<00:03:41.630> going<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.960> change<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
other strings that's going to change the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.930 
other strings that's going to change the
amount<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.710> tension<00:03:42.950> that's<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.460> a<00:03:43.490> it's

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
amount of tension that's on the a it's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.430 
amount of tension that's on the a it's
going<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> make<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> glint<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:44.960> tuning<00:03:45.320> in

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
going to make the a glint of tuning in

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.090 
going to make the a glint of tuning in
so<00:03:46.040> now<00:03:46.190> we're<00:03:46.340> going<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.490> go<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.240> D<00:03:47.450> and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
so now we're going to go to the D and

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.080 
so now we're going to go to the D and
this<00:03:49.100> one<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:51.430> little<00:03:52.430> trickier<00:03:52.880> because

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
this one is is a little trickier because

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.510 
this one is is a little trickier because
you<00:03:53.720> have<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.960> train<00:03:54.260> your<00:03:54.380> ear<00:03:54.710> to<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.160> what

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
you have to train your ear to know what

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.560 
you have to train your ear to know what
a<00:03:55.550> perfect<00:03:56.060> fit<00:03:56.330> sounds<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:59.360> you're

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
a perfect fit sounds like and if you're

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.080 
a perfect fit sounds like and if you're
not<00:03:59.750> really<00:03:59.930> sure<00:04:00.050> yet<00:04:00.530> then<00:04:00.770> you<00:04:00.890> can<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.220> go

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
not really sure yet then you can just go

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.140 
not really sure yet then you can just go
by<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.540> notes<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.530> tuner<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.850> we're

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
by the notes on the tuner and we're

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.000 
by the notes on the tuner and we're
going<00:04:05.270> to<00:04:05.330> tune<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.930> D<00:04:06.140> string<00:04:06.440> next<00:04:06.940> which

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
going to tune the D string next which

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.920 
going to tune the D string next which
right<00:04:10.010> now<00:04:10.190> it's<00:04:10.700> pretty<00:04:11.000> close<00:04:11.210> to<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.540> D<00:04:11.720> it's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
right now it's pretty close to a D it's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.650 
right now it's pretty close to a D it's
just<00:04:12.110> about<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.320> half<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.620> step<00:04:12.830> flat<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:14.120> you'll

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
just about a half a step flat but you'll

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.690 
just about a half a step flat but you'll
hear<00:04:14.930> what<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.200> sounds<00:04:15.560> like<00:04:15.740> for<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.609> this

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
hear what it sounds like for for this

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.180 
hear what it sounds like for for this
string<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.270> be<00:04:17.299> flat<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.989> D<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.410> then<00:04:18.770> slide

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
string to be flat of a D and then slide

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.270 
string to be flat of a D and then slide
up<00:04:19.520> into<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.209> D<00:04:20.480> when<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.230> play<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.920> and<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.250> D

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
up into a D when I play the a and the D

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:31.910 
up into a D when I play the a and the D
strings<00:04:22.700> together

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.410 

that's<00:04:32.920> a<00:04:33.040> perfect<00:04:33.430> fifth<00:04:33.700> now<00:04:34.120> I'm<00:04:34.240> going<00:04:34.360> to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
that's a perfect fifth now I'm going to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.559 
that's a perfect fifth now I'm going to

it and you just pluck your violin string
and<00:04:53.490> try<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.699> assess<00:04:54.059> if<00:04:54.270> your<00:04:54.389> string<00:04:54.689> is

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
and try to assess if your string is

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:03.529 
and try to assess if your string is
lower<00:04:55.020> or<00:04:55.139> higher<00:04:55.259> than<00:04:55.439> mine

okay now another little thing about

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.840 
okay now another little thing about
tuning<00:06:10.770> I<00:06:10.890> just<00:06:11.040> realized<00:06:11.310> I<00:06:11.400> need<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.700> tell

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
tuning I just realized I need to tell

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.900 
tuning I just realized I need to tell
you<00:06:11.970> guys<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.570> about<00:06:13.020> fine<00:06:13.440> tuners<00:06:13.920> hopefully

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
you guys is about fine tuners hopefully

you guys is about fine tuners hopefully
your<00:06:15.570> violin<00:06:16.050> has<00:06:16.290> little<00:06:16.710> fine<00:06:16.920> tuners<00:06:17.370> that

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
your violin has little fine tuners that

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.190 
your violin has little fine tuners that
are<00:06:17.640> knobs<00:06:17.880> like<00:06:18.150> this<00:06:18.450> on<00:06:18.720> every<00:06:19.020> single

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
are knobs like this on every single

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.360 
are knobs like this on every single
string<00:06:19.680> or<00:06:19.950> a<00:06:20.790> new<00:06:21.420> invention<00:06:21.780> is<00:06:22.680> geared

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
string or a new invention is geared

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.280 
string or a new invention is geared
tuning<00:06:23.820> pegs<00:06:24.060> I<00:06:24.240> actually<00:06:24.360> have<00:06:24.660> gears<00:06:24.960> in<00:06:25.170> my

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
tuning pegs I actually have gears in my

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.710 
tuning pegs I actually have gears in my
tuning<00:06:25.650> pegs<00:06:25.860> so<00:06:26.490> that<00:06:26.610> I<00:06:26.640> can<00:06:27.000> turn<00:06:27.480> them

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
tuning pegs so that I can turn them

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.100 
tuning pegs so that I can turn them
small<00:06:28.710> amounts<00:06:29.220> just<00:06:29.520> like<00:06:29.670> tuning<00:06:30.000> a<00:06:30.060> guitar

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
small amounts just like tuning a guitar

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.730 
small amounts just like tuning a guitar
where<00:06:31.110> on<00:06:31.440> on<00:06:31.950> your<00:06:32.430> violins<00:06:32.910> most<00:06:33.480> likely<00:06:33.960> to

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
where on on your violins most likely to

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.340 
where on on your violins most likely to
have<00:06:34.890> pure<00:06:35.220> friction<00:06:35.760> pegs<00:06:36.030> which<00:06:36.720> means<00:06:37.020> that

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
have pure friction pegs which means that

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.130 
have pure friction pegs which means that
you<00:06:38.310> have<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.670> push<00:06:38.940> in<00:06:39.240> on<00:06:39.390> the<00:06:39.510> peg<00:06:39.720> while<00:06:40.020> you

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
you have to push in on the peg while you

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.530 
you have to push in on the peg while you
turn<00:06:40.410> it<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:41.310> these<00:06:41.520> are<00:06:41.760> just<00:06:41.970> used<00:06:42.270> for

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
turn it so these are just used for

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.030 
turn it so these are just used for
getting<00:06:42.660> it<00:06:42.870> close<00:06:43.110> to<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.470> note<00:06:43.650> and<00:06:43.890> then

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
getting it close to the note and then

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.550 
getting it close to the note and then
you<00:06:44.130> use<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.460> fine<00:06:44.669> tuners<00:06:45.090> to<00:06:45.270> get<00:06:45.419> exact<00:06:45.810> so

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
you use the fine tuners to get exact so

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.110 
you use the fine tuners to get exact so
now<00:06:46.740> I've<00:06:46.950> been<00:06:46.980> through<00:06:47.490> all<00:06:47.520> the<00:06:47.820> strings

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
now I've been through all the strings

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.800 
now I've been through all the strings
once<00:06:48.419> I'm<00:06:48.720> just<00:06:48.919> welcome<00:06:50.120> help<00:06:51.120> them<00:06:51.330> cut<00:06:51.600> like

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
once I'm just welcome help them cut like

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.720 
once I'm just welcome help them cut like
loosen<00:06:52.320> it<00:06:52.890> a<00:06:52.919> little<00:06:53.010> bit<00:06:55.460> so<00:06:56.460> it's<00:06:56.580> very

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
loosen it a little bit so it's very

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.310 
loosen it a little bit so it's very
close<00:06:57.090> to<00:06:57.360> in<00:06:57.480> tune<00:06:57.720> but<00:06:57.930> it's<00:06:58.080> going<00:06:58.169> to<00:06:58.230> be

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
close to in tune but it's going to be

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.630 
close to in tune but it's going to be
it's<00:06:58.470> going<00:06:58.590> to<00:06:58.650> be<00:06:58.710> settling<00:06:59.190> in<00:06:59.310> a<00:06:59.400> little

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
it's going to be settling in a little

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.100 
it's going to be settling in a little
bit<00:06:59.760> now<00:06:59.910> that<00:06:59.940> I've<00:07:00.180> tuned<00:07:00.419> all<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.810> strings

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
bit now that I've tuned all the strings

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.900 
bit now that I've tuned all the strings
and<00:07:01.380> I'm<00:07:01.890> going<00:07:02.070> to<00:07:02.130> just<00:07:02.280> check<00:07:02.550> them<00:07:02.760> all

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
and I'm going to just check them all

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.840 
and I'm going to just check them all
again<00:07:03.180> with<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.510> tuner<00:07:04.130> to<00:07:05.130> see<00:07:05.340> what<00:07:05.610> it's

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850
