00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
push buttons this is the same gameplay

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.230

experience<00:02:09.539> as

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
experience as

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.880

adjusting the air temperature in your

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.500 
adjusting the air temperature in your
vehicle<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.520> there's<00:02:12.700> not<00:02:12.910> much<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.390> really

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
vehicle so there's not much to really

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.690 
vehicle so there's not much to really
talk<00:02:13.780> about<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.680> also<00:02:14.860> requires<00:02:15.370> about

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
talk about there it also requires about

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.430 
talk about there it also requires about
the<00:02:15.910> same<00:02:16.120> rhythmic<00:02:16.690> timing

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the same rhythmic timing

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.040 
the same rhythmic timing
however<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.790> presentation<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> little

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
however the presentation is a little

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.590 
however the presentation is a little
more<00:02:20.200> interesting<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:21.220> game<00:02:21.490> looks<00:02:21.880> really

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
more interesting this game looks really

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.380 
more interesting this game looks really
weird<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.530> uncomfortable<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.670> guess<00:02:24.700> that

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
weird and uncomfortable I guess that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.900 
weird and uncomfortable I guess that
looks<00:02:25.600> like<00:02:25.810> Britney<00:02:26.140> Spears<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:27.340> from<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
neck down which is really all that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.690 
neck down which is really all that
matters<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.810> guess<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.470> then<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.520> also

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
