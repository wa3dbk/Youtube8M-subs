00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 moin moin I am Linda von braiding 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.960
 point com and today I'll show you one 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.420
 very simple braid namely the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.130
 Stink normal French braid too 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.420
 good for all dads and moms who theirs 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.110
 Daughters neatly in school 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.540
 want to send 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.250
 and you divide first directly 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.890
 moore of over a large partie from the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 I do with my two index fingers 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 that does not have to be so neat 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 You are about to see this here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 I now have all over my head in the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.399
 hand and then you divide that into three 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.399
 strands all the same size 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.540
 then it starts in the normal 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 braid how that could work in one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 first watch the one side 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.920
 over the middle the other side over the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 middle and if it continues now with 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 again the next page over the middle 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.840
 then you take your index finger ride 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 from the side to the middle and once 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 takes this whole rove this in your 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.500
 middle finger that means I have now in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.439
 middle finger the normal strand and the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.299
 new strands from the side on the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.040
 other side exactly the same first 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.580
 comes the normal stand in the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 middle finger 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.130
 then I take my index finger was up 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.509
 to the middle and puts the strand to her 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.070
 can always be sure that the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.009
 the idea from the side stras 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.689
 takes nice smooth are just again 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.009
 to stroke my finger afterwards 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.840
 I usually take the thumb and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.060
 then continue to braid down 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.619
 important is that you each only the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840
 hair takes the same height 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.909
 are like your strands otherwise look at you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.000
 after that all hairstyle up and then 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.680
 does not look so neat again 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.090
 I am already over the middle now 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.890
 down here take the rest and on 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 the other side again the rest 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 and if you are at the bottom then you can 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.540
 Simply the zoff quite normal to end their 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 braid down with a rubber 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.960
 Close and ready is one
