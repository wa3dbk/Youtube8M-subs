00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.209
 Hello everybody 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.310
 Today I introduce you as promised 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.529
 of victory tour is attacked with walnut 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.420
 in front of the wood I have fine again 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.280
 However, wood de ordered this time 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.020
 same about 1 centimeter high 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.020
 slices like this one 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.480
 I then have one with them 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.579
 fretsaw the outlines of the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 sawn off handle shells and then by hand 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 with sandpaper in the right shape 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.769
 brought the finished handle shells 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.719
 were still treated with laughter or and 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.719
 then stuck with 300 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.640
 in contrast to the santos palisander 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.100
 wood so that I had mine here 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.870
 last reached shells have used is 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.670
 walnut wood a comparatively hard one 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.580
 wood so I clear this time 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.140
 I also sat longer in handle bowls 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.850
 I am more than satisfied with the result 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 I will probably soon no blankets 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.970
 do more by hand 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.970
 the effort is just too much for that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.190
 big to the knife itself 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.110
 it is the model tourist 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.220
 the company victorinox which in the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.369
 Switzerland is produced 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.440
 it is 84 cm long, 15 cm deep and 26 cm long 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.930
 high and weighs 49 grams 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 The blade is 54 cm long and 12 cm high 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.710
 2 mm wide 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.290
 that has a small blade with it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.690
 Let packages or letters open 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:07.130
 a big blade for everyone else 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:12.770
 Doing a can opener with one 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.150
 small screwdriver one 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.410
 bottle opener a big one 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.620
 screwdriver a corkscrew and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.620
 a tree 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.209
 have the tweezers and the toothpick 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.790
 I omitted the handle scales 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:40.540
 we come to the comparison the small railway 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.540
 has a pair of scissors more 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:51.120
 and the blade is about 1 half 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.030
 centimeters larger for that weighs 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.340
 tourist 40 less and is noticeable 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.540
 smaller and lighter so i 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.080
 actually only the tourist 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.080
 take 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.170
 So the tourist is a clear one 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.400
 recommendation for all who are looking for 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.230
 after a small light 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.360

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.720
 let accomplish 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.720
 Moreover, it is very cheap with 15 euros
