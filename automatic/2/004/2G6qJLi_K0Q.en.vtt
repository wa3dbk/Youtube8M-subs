00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.060 

well<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:11.020> crops<00:00:11.320> are<00:00:11.790> growing<00:00:12.790> very<00:00:13.180> well<00:00:13.480> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
well the crops are growing very well and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.589 
well the crops are growing very well and
they're<00:00:15.070> organic<00:00:15.549> and<00:00:15.910> some<00:00:16.150> of<00:00:16.240> them<00:00:16.360> have

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
they're organic and some of them have

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.060 
they're organic and some of them have
pesticides<00:00:16.960> and<00:00:17.349> I<00:00:17.410> think<00:00:17.650> that<00:00:17.770> we<00:00:17.890> should

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
pesticides and I think that we should

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.100 
pesticides and I think that we should
make<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.430> perfect<00:00:19.029> pesticide<00:00:19.540> for<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.869> crops

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
make a perfect pesticide for the crops

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.400 
make a perfect pesticide for the crops
but<00:00:20.860> it<00:00:21.550> is<00:00:21.820> good<00:00:22.090> for<00:00:22.119> people<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.840> healthy

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
but it is good for people and healthy

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.769 
but it is good for people and healthy
and<00:00:23.680> keeps<00:00:24.489> the<00:00:24.669> crops<00:00:24.880> preserves<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.599> you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
and keeps the crops preserves to you

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.420 
and keeps the crops preserves to you
because<00:00:26.050> we<00:00:26.290> need<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.619> food<00:00:26.860> because<00:00:27.220> it's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
because we need the food because it's

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.150
