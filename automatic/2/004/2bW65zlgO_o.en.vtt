cards<00:01:50.390> along<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.840> top<00:01:51.460> fairly<00:01:52.460> similar<00:01:52.789> to

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
cards along the top fairly similar to

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
of the same user interface which means

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.719 
of the same user interface which means
drag<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.109> up<00:01:57.229> from<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.560> bottom<00:01:57.740> swipe<00:01:58.429> through

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
two that really stood out for me were

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.420 
two that really stood out for me were
the<00:02:28.430> Sony<00:02:28.700> Xperia<00:02:28.810> z2<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.860> Samsung

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
Galaxy s5 so I decided to do as a sort

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.190 
Galaxy s5 so I decided to do as a sort
of<00:02:34.670> comparison<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.420> put<00:02:35.600> them<00:02:35.750> all<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.020> this

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
of comparison I put them all in this

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800 
of comparison I put them all in this
spreadsheet<00:02:36.790> comparing<00:02:37.790> all<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.180> specs<00:02:38.510> and

spreadsheet comparing all the specs and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.449 
spreadsheet comparing all the specs and
wrote<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:38.990> little<00:02:39.230> piece<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> differences

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
wrote a little piece on the differences

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.620 
wrote a little piece on the differences
the<00:02:40.670> stuff<00:02:40.910> that's<00:02:41.120> going<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.390> make<00:02:41.480> the

that<00:02:43.760> isn't<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.420> what<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.630> boils<00:02:44.959> down<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.440> for

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
that isn't and what it boils down to for

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.640 
that isn't and what it boils down to for
me<00:02:46.490> with<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.730> galaxy<00:02:47.239> s5<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.870> particular<00:02:48.260> is

they've<00:02:53.450> done<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.780> they<00:02:53.930> made<00:02:54.170> autofocus

features<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.290> one<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.650> ones<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:00.950> I

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
features and one of the ones that I

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.800 
features and one of the ones that I
wanted<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.670> talk<00:05:01.850> about<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:02.180> little<00:05:02.300> bit<00:05:02.450> apart

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
wanted to talk about a little bit apart

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.390 
wanted to talk about a little bit apart
from<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.050> stuff<00:05:03.290> I've<00:05:03.440> already<00:05:03.620> dimensioned

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
from the stuff I've already dimensioned

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.520 
from the stuff I've already dimensioned
is<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.910> waterproof<00:05:05.510> aspect<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.320> dust

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
is the waterproof aspect and the dust

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.770 
is the waterproof aspect and the dust
proof<00:05:06.830> aspect<00:05:07.370> again<00:05:08.180> it's<00:05:08.390> one<00:05:08.540> of<00:05:08.600> those

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
proof aspect again it's one of those

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.200 
proof aspect again it's one of those
things<00:05:08.840> it's<00:05:09.320> not<00:05:09.590> just<00:05:09.920> a<00:05:10.130> speck<00:05:10.550> on<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.820> sheet

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
things it's not just a speck on a sheet

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.240 
things it's not just a speck on a sheet
it's<00:05:11.810> not<00:05:11.930> just<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.260> specification<00:05:12.860> for<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
it's not just a specification for the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.160 
it's not just a specification for the

sake of a specification it actually

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.710 
sake of a specification it actually
makes<00:05:15.350> real<00:05:16.100> difference<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.700> users<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.240> real

life you go outside when it rains and

you answer your phone if it's not

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
like it or not you might not notice it

like it or not you might not notice it
for<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.750> while<00:05:26.960> but<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.470> will<00:05:27.710> make<00:05:28.010> a

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
for a while but it will make a

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.370 
for a while but it will make a
difference<00:05:28.550> if<00:05:29.000> you've<00:05:29.120> got<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.570> waterproof

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
difference if you've got a waterproof

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.620 
difference if you've got a waterproof
phone<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:31.550> that's<00:05:31.760> going<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:31.970> last<00:05:32.150> when<00:05:32.510> it

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
phone one that's going to last when it

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.510 
phone one that's going to last when it
rains<00:05:32.840> or<00:05:33.140> in<00:05:33.230> a<00:05:33.350> shower<00:05:33.590> or<00:05:33.740> even<00:05:34.100> if<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.280> drop

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
rains or in a shower or even if you drop

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.940 
rains or in a shower or even if you drop
it<00:05:34.550> down<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:34.910> toilet<00:05:35.240> hopefully<00:05:35.900> it's<00:05:36.680> a

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
it down the toilet hopefully it's a

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.950 
it down the toilet hopefully it's a
clean<00:05:37.220> toilet<00:05:37.700> if<00:05:38.030> that<00:05:38.360> happens<00:05:38.780> with<00:05:38.930> a

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
clean toilet if that happens with a

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.500 
clean toilet if that happens with a
waterproof<00:05:39.380> phone<00:05:39.620> it's<00:05:40.340> gonna<00:05:40.550> be<00:05:40.760> fine<00:05:41.000> but

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
waterproof phone it's gonna be fine but

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.960 
waterproof phone it's gonna be fine but
if<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.810> drop<00:05:41.990> an<00:05:42.140> iphone<00:05:42.500> down<00:05:42.740> there<00:05:43.010> it's

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
if you drop an iphone down there it's

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.450 
if you drop an iphone down there it's
dead<00:05:44.300> so<00:05:44.720> again<00:05:45.170> like<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.770> battery<00:05:46.100> life<00:05:46.250> it's

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
dead so again like the battery life it's

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.310 
dead so again like the battery life it's
something<00:05:46.850> that<00:05:46.970> Apple<00:05:47.360> has<00:05:47.390> to<00:05:47.660> look<00:05:47.990> at<00:05:48.170> in

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
something that Apple has to look at in

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.650 
something that Apple has to look at in
terms<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.800> protecting<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.820> device<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.390> I<00:05:50.510> was

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
terms of protecting the device and I was

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.390 
terms of protecting the device and I was
interesting<00:05:51.200> how<00:05:51.350> they<00:05:51.590> might<00:05:51.800> achieve<00:05:52.040> that

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
interesting how they might achieve that

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.010 
interesting how they might achieve that
I<00:05:52.460> don't<00:05:52.790> know<00:05:52.940> maybe<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.420> can<00:05:53.630> answer<00:05:53.750> this

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
I don't know maybe you can answer this

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.530 
I don't know maybe you can answer this
question<00:05:54.530> for<00:05:54.560> me<00:05:55.070> if<00:05:55.640> Apple<00:05:56.090> did<00:05:56.300> make<00:05:56.510> a

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
question for me if Apple did make a

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.570 
question for me if Apple did make a
waterproof<00:05:57.140> phone<00:05:57.170> how<00:05:58.040> would<00:05:58.220> it<00:05:58.370> do<00:05:58.550> that

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
waterproof phone how would it do that

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.980 
waterproof phone how would it do that
would<00:05:58.940> he<00:05:58.970> use<00:05:59.210> some<00:05:59.480> sort<00:05:59.690> of<00:05:59.750> liquid

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
would he use some sort of liquid

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.530 
would he use some sort of liquid
membrane<00:06:00.950> in<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.760> manufacturing<00:06:02.480> process

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
membrane in the manufacturing process

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.970 
membrane in the manufacturing process
which<00:06:03.110> would<00:06:03.290> mean<00:06:03.440> that<00:06:03.500> maybe<00:06:03.830> the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
which would mean that maybe the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.710 
which would mean that maybe the
manufacturing<00:06:04.640> takes<00:06:04.880> longer<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.390> they

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
manufacturing takes longer and they

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.360 
manufacturing takes longer and they
wouldn't<00:06:05.930> be<00:06:06.050> able<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.260> get<00:06:06.350> in<00:06:06.500> enough<00:06:06.950> out<00:06:07.190> in

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
wouldn't be able to get in enough out in

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.190 
wouldn't be able to get in enough out in
time<00:06:07.610> or<00:06:08.150> would<00:06:08.330> they<00:06:08.450> do<00:06:08.510> what<00:06:08.780> everyone<00:06:09.020> else

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
time or would they do what everyone else

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.650 
time or would they do what everyone else
does<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.710> i<00:06:09.800> can't<00:06:10.100> imagine<00:06:10.280> this<00:06:10.940> at<00:06:11.210> all<00:06:11.420> but

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
does and i can't imagine this at all but

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.110 
does and i can't imagine this at all but
could<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:12.170> imagine<00:06:12.470> if<00:06:12.800> Apple<00:06:13.280> put<00:06:13.730> flaps

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
could you imagine if Apple put flaps

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.940 
could you imagine if Apple put flaps
over<00:06:14.450> the<00:06:14.900> Lightning<00:06:15.380> boards<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:15.860> the

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
over the Lightning boards and the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.890 
over the Lightning boards and the
headset<00:06:16.400> to<00:06:16.550> stop<00:06:16.790> water<00:06:17.030> getting<00:06:17.180> in<00:06:17.630> I<00:06:17.750> mean

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
headset to stop water getting in I mean

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.780 
headset to stop water getting in I mean
I<00:06:18.080> personally<00:06:18.200> couldn't<00:06:18.980> but<00:06:19.250> that's<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.670> way

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
I personally couldn't but that's the way

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.030 
I personally couldn't but that's the way
that<00:06:19.970> Samsung<00:06:20.450> and<00:06:20.570> Sony<00:06:20.630> have<00:06:21.020> gone<00:06:21.200> which

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
that Samsung and Sony have gone which

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.950 
that Samsung and Sony have gone which
maybe<00:06:22.310> suggests<00:06:22.880> that<00:06:22.970> Apple<00:06:23.360> definitely

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
maybe suggests that Apple definitely

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.300 
maybe suggests that Apple definitely
won't<00:06:24.140> do<00:06:24.350> that<00:06:24.380> let<00:06:24.890> me<00:06:24.980> know<00:06:25.100> your<00:06:25.250> thoughts

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
won't do that let me know your thoughts

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.790 
won't do that let me know your thoughts
on<00:06:25.760> waterproofing<00:06:26.480> dust<00:06:26.750> proofing<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.440> think

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
on waterproofing dust proofing you think

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.740 
on waterproofing dust proofing you think
that<00:06:28.370> that<00:06:28.580> is<00:06:28.820> something<00:06:29.120> that<00:06:29.270> Apple's

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
that that is something that Apple's

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.140 
that that is something that Apple's
should<00:06:29.930> consider<00:06:30.410> for<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:30.920> iphone<00:06:31.400> 6<00:06:31.700> or<00:06:32.030> the
