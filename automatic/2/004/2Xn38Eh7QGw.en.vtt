hi<00:00:26.170> I'm<00:00:26.410> Shawn<00:00:26.650> Liang<00:00:26.860> in<00:00:27.100> this<00:00:27.220> video<00:00:27.460> we<00:00:27.610> look

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
hi I'm Shawn Liang in this video we look

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.450 
hi I'm Shawn Liang in this video we look
at<00:00:27.970> breaking<00:00:28.540> up<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.930> lead<00:00:29.140> hand<00:00:29.410> now<00:00:30.310> what

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
at breaking up the lead hand now what

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.000 
at breaking up the lead hand now what
that<00:00:30.490> means<00:00:30.759> is<00:00:31.029> playing<00:00:31.960> different<00:00:32.500> types<00:00:32.860> of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
that means is playing different types of

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.380 
that means is playing different types of
patterns<00:00:33.340> rather<00:00:33.489> than<00:00:33.790> just<00:00:33.940> straight

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
way we need to do that is we need to let

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.799 
way we need to do that is we need to let
all<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.340> our<00:00:45.670> limbs<00:00:45.910> keep<00:00:46.300> doing<00:00:46.570> what<00:00:46.690> they're

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
all of our limbs keep doing what they're

all of our limbs keep doing what they're
doing<00:00:46.989> we<00:00:47.050> need<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.230> maintain<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.620> backbeat

maintain<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.610> double<00:00:48.850> kick<00:00:49.030> or<00:00:49.239> whatever

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
maintain the double kick or whatever

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.960 
maintain the double kick or whatever
beat<00:00:49.809> you're<00:00:49.930> doing<00:00:50.199> but<00:00:51.190> we<00:00:51.340> also<00:00:51.519> need<00:00:51.790> to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
beat you're doing but we also need to

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.939 
beat you're doing but we also need to
add<00:00:52.210> some<00:00:52.600> sort<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:52.930> dynamic<00:00:53.230> some<00:00:53.739> sort<00:00:53.920> of

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
add some sort of dynamic some sort of

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.469 
add some sort of dynamic some sort of
groove<00:00:54.190> over<00:00:54.430> top<00:00:54.670> of<00:00:54.820> it<00:00:54.909> so<00:00:55.120> how<00:00:55.239> do<00:00:55.299> we<00:00:55.360> do

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
groove over top of it so how do we do

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.500 
groove over top of it so how do we do
that<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:56.500> right<00:00:56.710> hand<00:00:56.949> it's<00:00:57.580> our<00:00:57.760> right<00:00:58.000> hand

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
that the right hand it's our right hand

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.000 
that the right hand it's our right hand
you<00:00:59.019> know<00:00:59.110> we're<00:00:59.260> riding<00:00:59.589> on<00:00:59.680> different

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
you know we're riding on different

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.500 
you know we're riding on different
surfaces<00:01:00.129> doesn't<00:01:00.580> necessarily<00:01:01.269> need<00:01:01.330> to<00:01:01.420> be

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
surfaces doesn't necessarily need to be

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.630 
surfaces doesn't necessarily need to be
the<00:01:01.629> ride<00:01:01.809> cymbal<00:01:02.290> but<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.220> don't<00:01:03.400> want<00:01:03.549> to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the ride cymbal but we don't want to

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.750 
the ride cymbal but we don't want to
just<00:01:03.820> stick<00:01:04.120> to<00:01:04.299> stagnant<00:01:04.870> boring<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:06.610> two

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
just stick to stagnant boring one two

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.160 
just stick to stagnant boring one two
three<00:01:06.970> four<00:01:07.150> one<00:01:07.270> two<00:01:07.420> three<00:01:07.450> four<00:01:07.659> patterns

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
three four one two three four patterns

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.870 
three four one two three four patterns
and<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.470> we'll<00:01:08.590> break<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.950> pattern<00:01:09.100> up<00:01:09.400> we'll

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
and so we'll break that pattern up we'll

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.969 
and so we'll break that pattern up we'll
accent<00:01:10.360> what's<00:01:10.780> going<00:01:11.080> on<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.500> music<00:01:11.619> and

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
accent what's going on in the music and

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.649 
accent what's going on in the music and
play<00:01:12.280> off<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.729> we're<00:01:13.270> gonna<00:01:13.330> go<00:01:13.510> through

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
play off of it we're gonna go through

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.210 
play off of it we're gonna go through
five<00:01:13.869> different<00:01:13.900> patterns<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.680> help<00:01:14.830> us<00:01:14.950> work

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
five different patterns to help us work

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.580 
five different patterns to help us work
on<00:01:15.520> breaking<00:01:16.119> up<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.390> right<00:01:16.510> hand<00:01:16.810> we'll

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
on breaking up the right hand we'll

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
on breaking up the right hand we'll
start<00:01:17.740> with<00:01:17.860> exercise<00:01:18.070> one

so<00:04:26.639> those<00:04:26.790> are<00:04:26.910> five<00:04:27.030> exercises<00:04:27.360> on<00:04:27.780> breaking

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
so those are five exercises on breaking

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.990 
so those are five exercises on breaking
up<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.320> lead<00:04:28.470> hand<00:04:28.650> now<00:04:29.070> as<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.310> can<00:04:29.400> guess<00:04:29.639> it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
up the lead hand now as you can guess it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.280 
up the lead hand now as you can guess it
can<00:04:30.090> be<00:04:30.120> pretty<00:04:30.389> tricky<00:04:30.570> but<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.020> payoff

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
can be pretty tricky but the payoff

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.629 
can be pretty tricky but the payoff
makes<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.710> hundred<00:04:31.889> percent<00:04:32.010> worth<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
makes it a hundred percent worth it I

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.520 
makes it a hundred percent worth it I
guarantee<00:04:33.210> you'll<00:04:33.389> see<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.540> huge<00:04:33.870> payoff<00:04:34.290> in

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
guarantee you'll see a huge payoff in

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.379 
guarantee you'll see a huge payoff in
your<00:04:34.710> playing<00:04:34.919> just<00:04:35.370> practice<00:04:35.729> hard<00:04:35.910> I'll<00:04:36.240> see

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
your playing just practice hard I'll see

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.440 
your playing just practice hard I'll see
you<00:04:36.450> again<00:04:36.540> soon

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450
