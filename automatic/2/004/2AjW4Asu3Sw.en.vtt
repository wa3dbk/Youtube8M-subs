00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.440
 Diaper is a laced package that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 consists of many parts 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.029
 that was for us like switzerland 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.390
 Switzerland consists of different 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.580
 different parts of the country 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 national languages ​​and regions cantons 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.940
 of course, the wincing surrendered 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 that whole the charts and this picture 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 we transformed into architecture 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.340
 started to handle this pendulum yet 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 to polish up and then actually 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 on this flaw fresh house of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.920
 come and then we thought a big one 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.670
 Diaper does not reflect will not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 Switzerland will make four bundles and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.420
 do act here 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 the message is clearly switzerland 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.250
 become a piece of switzerland with 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.970
 Russia where we take Switzerland 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.490
 live in the show we show our am 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 a bit hard at the beginning 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.360
 you were the stereotypes of Switzerland 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.000
 pretty much hit and afterwards 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 do not like these always the same 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 stories like cheese neutrality 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.260
 Of course he will go along with everything 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.240
 Involve and become the target 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.820
 not just about the flat too 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 communicate but really as 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.100
 first research what is switzerland 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.640
 for us 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 or what we know 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 switzerland in international discourse 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.180
 the building is clear that was like a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.510
 In the beginning, the bid must be real estate 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.750
 is it a nordic he will 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.220
 no longer used in sochi 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.140
 Basics were that's likely 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.500
 also the topic is called it 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.650
 reused water 16 on and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.390
 it's rundown and you have to 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.090
 can endure 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.700
 it needs to be loaded and can 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.820
 thumb we have a clear grid 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.180
 chosen as elemental for all this 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.630
 functional was the measure of the vice of 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.820
 Transport the container that you 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.410
 what was actually going to happen and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.230
 came out and all who 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.990
 really tailor-made and relieve 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.310
 the proportionate the whole construction 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.870
 certainly 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.069
 while almost everyone including the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.290
 become Switzerland 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.300
 of course that will be the braid and then 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.730
 Of course , that's the whole thing 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.780
 entire furniture is swiss design 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.459
 our high-carat great design 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.610
 we are playing the third one intended 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.100
 switch 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.459
 the cannabis as a puzzle and one 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.459
 such a
