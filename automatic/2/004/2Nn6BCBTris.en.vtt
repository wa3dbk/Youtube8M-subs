sometimes as far as getting the shot
this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:14.120> particular<00:00:15.120> tight<00:00:15.809> rural<00:00:16.320> road<00:00:16.650> in

this is a particular tight rural road in
a<00:00:17.070> border<00:00:18.000> lying<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.390> state<00:00:18.660> park<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
a border lying a state park and as you

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.630 
a border lying a state park and as you
can<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.580> definitely<00:00:21.240> forestry<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.260> wet

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640
