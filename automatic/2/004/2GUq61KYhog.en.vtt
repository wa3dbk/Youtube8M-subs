now once you've practiced forward
phrases<00:00:16.070> on<00:00:16.250> your<00:00:16.460> own<00:00:16.580> then<00:00:16.970> it's<00:00:17.119> good<00:00:17.270> to

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
phrases on your own then it's good to

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.880 
phrases on your own then it's good to
work<00:00:17.510> with<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:17.689> partner<00:00:18.020> now<00:00:18.289> we<00:00:18.349> could<00:00:18.650> do<00:00:18.770> this

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
work with a partner now we could do this

you know these are really basic footwork
exercises<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.130> we<00:00:22.250> could<00:00:22.369> do<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:22.610> with<00:00:22.849> one

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
exercises so we could do this with one

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.460 
exercises so we could do this with one
fencer<00:00:23.599> where<00:00:23.779> they<00:00:23.840> light<00:00:23.960> up<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.349> their

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
fencer where they light up and their

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
hand it doesn't really matter so this is

bender<00:01:27.670> our<00:01:27.820> first

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.719 

well<00:01:38.420> right<00:01:38.659> from<00:01:38.689> there<00:01:39.020> right<00:01:39.259> into<00:01:39.770> working

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
well right from there right into working

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.639 
well right from there right into working
on<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.969> drop<00:01:41.270> lunch<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.840> accelerated

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
on the drop lunch and accelerated

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.870 
on the drop lunch and accelerated
Advanced<00:01:42.920> Learner's<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.340> let's<00:01:43.520> lift<00:01:43.759> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
Advanced Learner's so let's lift the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:58.450 
Advanced Learner's so let's lift the
back<00:01:44.090> foot<00:01:44.360> drop<00:01:44.659> at<00:01:44.930> lunch

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.719 

okay

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
okay

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
okay
so<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.210> simply<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.630> act<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.260> these

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
so we simply can act we can make these

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
so we simply can act we can make these
more<00:02:01.590> complicated<00:02:02.220> where<00:02:02.370> we<00:02:02.490> add<00:02:02.670> blade<00:02:03.030> work

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
more complicated where we add blade work

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.820 
more complicated where we add blade work
especially<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.590> would<00:02:04.680> make

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
especially on this one it would make

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.260 
especially on this one it would make
sense<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.190> underway<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> make<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> line

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
sense for underway to make the line

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.930 
sense for underway to make the line
change<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.229> accelerated<00:02:07.890> advancement

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.910 

volley<00:02:11.940> forward<00:02:12.360> too<00:02:12.480> much<00:02:12.510> step<00:02:12.990> drops<00:02:13.350> step

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
volley forward too much step drops step

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.720 
volley forward too much step drops step

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
6

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.729 
6
that's<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.240> good<00:02:15.450> balance<00:02:15.660> good<00:02:18.890> good<00:02:21.739> all

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
that's a good balance good good all

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.840 
that's a good balance good good all
right<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:22.950> we're<00:02:23.070> going<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.220> practice<00:02:23.459> just

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
right now we're going to practice just

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.610 
right now we're going to practice just
this<00:02:24.000> idea<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.480> getting<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
this idea of getting out of the way and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
this idea of getting out of the way and
attacking<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.700> an<00:02:26.790> F<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.030> picture<00:02:27.390> in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
attacking back I have an F a picture in

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.820 
attacking back I have an F a picture in
front<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.720> me<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.050> makes<00:02:28.230> more<00:02:28.410> sense<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
front of me so it makes more sense to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.040 
front of me so it makes more sense to
retreat<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.459> London<00:02:29.850> versus<00:02:30.270> retreat<00:02:30.750> advance

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
retreat in London versus retreat advance

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.140 
retreat in London versus retreat advance
launch<00:02:31.320> breath

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.490 

we<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.330> retreats<00:02:40.720> out<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.020> this<00:02:41.170> insanity

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
we just retreats out of this insanity

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.530 
we just retreats out of this insanity

sort<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.090> eased<00:05:07.300> into<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.630> next<00:05:07.900> step<00:05:08.080> go

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
sort of eased into the next step go

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.950 
sort of eased into the next step go
strong<00:05:09.180> yeah<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.390> then<00:05:10.510> faster<00:05:10.960> at<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.170> end

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
strong yeah and then faster at the end

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.810 
strong yeah and then faster at the end
so<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:13.990> like<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.380> first<00:05:14.590> one<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.950> best<00:05:14.980> okay

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
so I like the first one the best okay

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.610 
so I like the first one the best okay
okay

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
okay

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.230 
okay
another<00:05:17.620> distance<00:05:18.070> dealing<00:05:18.430> tech<00:05:18.640> technique

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
another distance dealing tech technique

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.180 
another distance dealing tech technique
is<00:05:19.420> to<00:05:19.690> suddenly<00:05:20.080> change<00:05:20.170> direction<00:05:20.860> so

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
is to suddenly change direction so

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.620 
is to suddenly change direction so
you're<00:05:21.280> going<00:05:21.580> forward<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.270> do<00:05:22.390> a<00:05:22.420> half

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
you're going forward and you do a half

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.240 
you're going forward and you do a half
your<00:05:22.810> treat<00:05:22.960> advanced<00:05:23.230> lunch<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.800> often<00:05:24.070> will

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
your treat advanced lunch it often will

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.920 
your treat advanced lunch it often will
freeze<00:05:24.550> me<00:05:24.790> it'll<00:05:25.120> make<00:05:25.240> me<00:05:25.360> stop<00:05:25.660> for<00:05:25.690> a

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
freeze me it'll make me stop for a

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.840 
freeze me it'll make me stop for a
second<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.380> then<00:05:26.530> you'll<00:05:26.710> catch<00:05:26.920> me<00:05:27.160> there's

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
second and then you'll catch me there's

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.550 
second and then you'll catch me there's
ways<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.240> do<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.480> in<00:05:28.630> all<00:05:28.780> three<00:05:28.810> weapons<00:05:29.200> but

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
ways to do this in all three weapons but

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.810 
ways to do this in all three weapons but
let's<00:05:29.680> see<00:05:29.770> we<00:05:29.950> got<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.100> fall<00:05:30.280> offense<00:05:30.550> or<00:05:30.700> let's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
let's see we got a fall offense or let's

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.360 
let's see we got a fall offense or let's
try

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.830 

and<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.490> little<00:05:35.760> half<00:05:35.940> retreat<00:05:36.420> makes<00:05:36.660> me

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
and that little half retreat makes me

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.990 
and that little half retreat makes me
stop<00:05:37.140> for<00:05:37.170> a<00:05:37.440> second<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.860> then<00:05:38.010> he<00:05:38.130> catches<00:05:38.490> me

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.760 

but<00:05:42.000> also<00:05:42.300> note<00:05:42.660> that<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:42.960> director<00:05:43.410> most<00:05:43.650> of

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
but also note that the director most of

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.950 
but also note that the director most of
the<00:05:43.830> time<00:05:44.010> just<00:05:44.250> really<00:05:44.850> sees<00:05:45.090> forward<00:05:45.570> motion

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
the time just really sees forward motion

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.050 
the time just really sees forward motion
they<00:05:46.110> don't<00:05:46.290> see<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> stop<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.520> go<00:05:47.700> they<00:05:48.000> see

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
they don't see a stop and a go they see

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.000 
they don't see a stop and a go they see
what<00:05:48.510> action<00:05:48.900> so<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.410> can<00:05:49.500> probably<00:05:49.650> even<00:05:49.890> get

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
what action so you can probably even get

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.830 
what action so you can probably even get
away<00:05:50.130> with<00:05:50.370> this<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.700> Sabre<00:05:51.000> where<00:05:51.690> you're

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
away with this in the Sabre where you're

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.480 
away with this in the Sabre where you're
the<00:05:52.080> whole<00:05:52.260> thing<00:05:52.530> is<00:05:52.710> considered<00:05:53.220> an<00:05:53.370> attack

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
the whole thing is considered an attack

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.680 
the whole thing is considered an attack
even<00:05:53.940> though<00:05:54.060> you're<00:05:54.270> literally<00:05:54.540> changing

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
even though you're literally changing

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.520 
even though you're literally changing
directions<00:05:56.690> all<00:05:57.690> right<00:05:57.810> we'll<00:05:57.960> just<00:05:58.110> work<00:05:58.380> on

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
directions all right we'll just work on

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.140 
directions all right we'll just work on
fleshing<00:05:59.040> skills<00:05:59.340> a<00:05:59.490> little<00:05:59.670> bit<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.030> we're

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
fleshing skills a little bit so we're

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.610 
fleshing skills a little bit so we're
going<00:06:00.270> to<00:06:00.360> advance<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.900> flash<00:06:01.140> and<00:06:01.500> then

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
going to advance it flash and then

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.590 
going to advance it flash and then
retreat<00:06:02.010> in<00:06:02.130> flash<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.610> resets<00:06:03.030> a<00:06:03.120> very<00:06:03.390> nice

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
retreat in flash that resets a very nice

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.600 
retreat in flash that resets a very nice
fletchling

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.450 

Bansi

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:23.840 

but<00:06:16.460> let's<00:06:17.300> have<00:06:17.450> a<00:06:17.510> retreating<00:06:17.840> fun

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.620 

if<00:06:24.090> your<00:06:24.240> time<00:06:24.420> because<00:06:24.960> you're<00:06:25.110> handsome

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.970 

it<00:06:30.630> still<00:06:30.870> feels<00:06:31.050> to<00:06:31.260> the<00:06:31.350> temple<00:06:31.770> doesn't

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
it still feels to the temple doesn't

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.940 
it still feels to the temple doesn't
feel<00:06:32.190> quite<00:06:32.400> right<00:06:32.490> but<00:06:33.240> let's<00:06:34.140> not<00:06:34.380> we<00:06:34.770> just

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
feel quite right but let's not we just

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.780 
feel quite right but let's not we just
retreat<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:35.400> first<00:06:35.610> time<00:06:35.760> in<00:06:35.880> this<00:06:35.940> up<00:06:37.790> okay

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
retreat the first time in this up okay

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.000 
retreat the first time in this up okay
so<00:06:38.850> next<00:06:39.090> time<00:06:39.270> we<00:06:39.390> retreated<00:06:39.930> start<00:06:40.260> to<00:06:40.410> lean

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
so next time we retreated start to lean

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.920 
so next time we retreated start to lean
in

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:58.530 

that<00:06:47.930> was<00:06:48.110> different

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.600 

you
