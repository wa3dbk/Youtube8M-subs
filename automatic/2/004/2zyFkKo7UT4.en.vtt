sticker off and no stickers so this was

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.890 
sticker off and no stickers so this was
the<00:02:45.380> best<00:02:45.560> hood<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.850> one<00:02:47.060> actually<00:02:47.270> had<00:02:47.660> less

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
rust on it but it was all dinged up in

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.260 
rust on it but it was all dinged up in
the<00:02:51.440> front<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.640> really<00:02:52.910> didn't<00:02:53.120> feel<00:02:53.209> like

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
the front and I really didn't feel like

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.470 
the front and I really didn't feel like
trying<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.660> straighten<00:02:53.900> those<00:02:54.140> out<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.480> reason

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
trying to straighten those out so reason

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.050 
trying to straighten those out so reason
that<00:02:56.600> one<00:02:57.760> okay

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that one okay

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.880 
that one okay
the<00:02:59.390> stickers<00:02:59.780> are<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> pain<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.380> ass<00:03:00.620> to

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
the stickers are a pain in the ass to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.050

the<00:03:03.600> heat<00:03:03.780> gun<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.410> don't<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.740> was

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
the heat gun just I don't think was

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.400 
the heat gun just I don't think was
heating<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.190> up<00:03:05.310> well<00:03:05.490> enough

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
heating it up well enough

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.760 
heating it up well enough
we're<00:03:06.770> fast<00:03:07.010> enough<00:03:07.400> for<00:03:07.610> me

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
we're fast enough for me

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.940 
we're fast enough for me
I'm<00:03:09.700> going<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.940> use<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> torch

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.350 

hopefully<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.879> works<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.300> little<00:03:14.330> better

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.150 

this<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.020> just<00:03:18.230> one<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.410> those<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.950> could<00:03:19.040> use

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
this is just one of those you could use

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.860 
this is just one of those you could use
a<00:03:19.220> normal<00:03:19.610> corks<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.970> imagine<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.660> just

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
a normal corks I imagine this is just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.590 
a normal corks I imagine this is just
one<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.080> those<00:03:21.170> wheat<00:03:21.620> burners<00:03:22.360> they<00:03:23.360> had<00:03:23.510> in

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
angling off the porch that probably

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.350 
angling off the porch that probably
would<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:35.500> taken<00:04:35.860> 10<00:04:36.340> minutes<00:04:36.639> solid

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360
