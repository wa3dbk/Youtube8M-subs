way there's a little seal in there it

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.910 
way there's a little seal in there it
keeps<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.110> from

keeps it from
leaking<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.849> is<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> bite<00:02:13.299> valve<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.080> all<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> do

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
leaking it is a bite valve so all you do

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.559 
leaking it is a bite valve so all you do
is<00:02:14.920> bite<00:02:15.159> down<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.670> if<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:15.970> have<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.150> open<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
is bite down it if you have it open and

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.930 
is bite down it if you have it open and
you<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.930> hanging<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.290> doesn't<00:02:17.590> leak<00:02:17.940> as

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
you have it hanging it doesn't leak as

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.190 
you have it hanging it doesn't leak as
far<00:02:19.209> as<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.540> mean<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.989> haven't<00:02:20.290> had<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.500> leak<00:02:20.620> yet

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
far as I mean I haven't had it leak yet

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.089 
far as I mean I haven't had it leak yet
of<00:02:23.200> course<00:02:23.470> all<00:02:23.650> these<00:02:23.769> things<00:02:23.980> are

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
of course all these things are

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.039 
of course all these things are
replaceable<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.310> standard<00:02:28.049> one

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
replaceable to it's just a standard one

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.640 
replaceable to it's just a standard one
and<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.230> half<00:02:29.409> if<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.099> unscrew<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:31.590> you'll<00:02:32.590> be

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and a half if you unscrew this you'll be

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.020 
and a half if you unscrew this you'll be
able<00:02:32.829> to<00:02:33.040> pull<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> whole<00:02:33.489> bladder<00:02:33.730> out<00:02:39.030> just

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
able to pull the whole bladder out just

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.490 
able to pull the whole bladder out just
take<00:02:40.239> off<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:41.159> plastic<00:02:42.159> piece<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:43.410> pull<00:02:44.410> it

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
take off the plastic piece here pull it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.280 
take off the plastic piece here pull it
right<00:02:44.590> out

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
so the whole bladder comes out it does

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.539 
so the whole bladder comes out it does
have<00:02:54.970> measurements<00:02:55.629> on<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> let's<00:02:59.109> see

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
have measurements on it so let's see

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.610 
have measurements on it so let's see
yeah<00:03:00.549> more<00:03:01.239> than<00:03:01.269> half<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.659> liter<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.930> may<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> fill

then<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.250> bike<00:05:13.430> file<00:05:13.640> went<00:05:13.850> back<00:05:14.000> down

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
then the bike file went back down

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.180 
then the bike file went back down
already<00:05:14.540> but<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.380> need<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.620> just<00:05:16.040> adjust

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
already but if you need to just adjust

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.730 
already but if you need to just adjust
it<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:17.030> read<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.270> side<00:05:17.510> if<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:18.440> have<00:05:18.620> it

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
it to read the side if you have it

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.930 
it to read the side if you have it
coming<00:05:18.950> through<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.220> side<00:05:19.490> comes<00:05:19.760> through

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
coming through the side comes through

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.760 
coming through the side comes through
here<00:05:20.830> then<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.280> cap<00:05:22.490> does<00:05:22.700> have<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:24.320> piece<00:05:24.560> on

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
here then the cap does have the piece on

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.120 
here then the cap does have the piece on
it<00:05:24.890> to<00:05:25.010> keep<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.310> from<00:05:25.520> from<00:05:25.970> losing<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.360> cap

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130

of<00:05:28.130> course<00:05:29.350> screw<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.500> on<00:05:30.620> there<00:05:30.830> just<00:05:30.890> push<00:05:31.310> it

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
of course screw it on there just push it

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.930 
of course screw it on there just push it
all<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.670> way<00:05:31.760> on<00:05:31.790> either<00:05:32.690> way<00:05:32.840> goes<00:05:33.140> on<00:05:33.940> so

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
all the way on either way goes on so

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.800

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
me all the time but other than that

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.480 
me all the time but other than that
that's<00:05:59.720> pretty<00:06:00.230> good<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:00.500> think<00:06:00.680> decided<00:06:01.340> on

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
that's pretty good I think decided on

that's pretty good I think decided on
this<00:06:01.640> or<00:06:01.910> 14<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:02.840> half<00:06:03.020> by<00:06:03.260> ten<00:06:03.560> and<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.740> half

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
this or 14 and a half by ten and a half

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.450 
this or 14 and a half by ten and a half
I<00:06:04.610> think<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.330> has<00:06:05.450> like<00:06:05.480> a<00:06:05.890> 100<00:06:06.890> cubic<00:06:07.160> inches

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
