00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.950
 Hello, the site is personal and the tip is the consumption 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.220
 indicated by the on-board computer of the 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:26.550
 citroen c3 picasso for example here is the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 my car case 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:37.239
 come less before the DMV le 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.280
 then the number 100 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.879
 this smaller number is the amount of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.979
 petrol spends to run 100 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:50.080
 kilometers 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:53.409
 in another video the channel does not spend 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.659
 fuel from being deceived by this 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:05.110
 You can get into the car without a problem. 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:07.450
 is attached consumption is slightly ridiculous 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:24.520
 different from the one you are accustomed to 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:28.630
 see right here and we will not divide 10 198 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.249
 liter is making 11 goals three for 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:38.319
 every liter 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:40.420
 so the lower the first number is 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.249
 a simple but a little different thing 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.710
 what are you accustomed to? 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:48.850
 maybe in europe the staff in portugal is 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:54.939
 already have become more accustomed to brazil looks 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.460
 plus the side of the organ so many liters 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.780
 100 kilometers a different shape but 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.229
 very efficient 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.409
 It's good, this is a video a very 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.290
 cool here who saw us was eduardo 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.600
 sitraemg santos collaborator there so we 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.660
 anything in Citroen Procrustean act 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.450
 saints very intelligent guy understands 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.440
 who likes the brand a lot is a guy who 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.020
 breathe good citroen 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.020
 Professional sound better young and up to today 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.020
 the car itself is that eduardo
