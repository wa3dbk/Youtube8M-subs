other medical problems when they're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.879 
other medical problems when they're
first<00:03:06.599> brought<00:03:06.870> into<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.200> examining<00:03:07.650> room

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
basic questions and take vital signs we

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.409 
basic questions and take vital signs we
then<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:16.889> doctor<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.609> then<00:03:17.819> enter<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.180> room

basically ask the patient about their

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.119 
basically ask the patient about their
problem<00:03:24.169> one<00:03:25.169> of<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.319> most<00:03:25.469> important<00:03:25.889> things

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
problem one of the most important things

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.009 
problem one of the most important things
to<00:03:26.219> do<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.669> really<00:03:26.939> let<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.299> patient<00:03:27.449> describe

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
to do is really let the patient describe

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.869 
to do is really let the patient describe
their<00:03:28.260> problem<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.799> listen<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.579> what<00:03:29.699> they're

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
their problem and listen to what they're

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.349 
their problem and listen to what they're
saying<00:03:31.010> often<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.129> we<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.459> listen<00:03:32.939> we<00:03:33.120> then

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
saying often if we just listen we then

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.789 
saying often if we just listen we then
don't<00:03:33.599> really<00:03:33.989> have<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.230> ask<00:03:34.379> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.650> of

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
don't really have to ask a lot of

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.000 
don't really have to ask a lot of
questions<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.609> certainly<00:03:35.939> we<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.949> try<00:03:37.949> to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
questions but certainly we do and try to

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.860 
questions but certainly we do and try to
determine<00:03:38.400> what<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.939> nature<00:03:39.120> there's<00:03:39.510> their

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
determine what the nature there's their

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.780 
determine what the nature there's their
symptoms<00:03:40.530> are<00:03:40.709> which<00:03:40.919> what<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.489> nature<00:03:41.760> of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
symptoms are which what the nature of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.330 
symptoms are which what the nature of
their<00:03:41.939> problem<00:03:42.389> is<00:03:42.620> once<00:03:43.620> we've<00:03:43.859> completed

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
their problem is once we've completed

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.309 
their problem is once we've completed
that<00:03:45.090> part<00:03:45.389> of<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.540> process<00:03:45.750> we're<00:03:46.199> usually

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
that part of the process we're usually

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.709 
that part of the process we're usually
going<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.799> take<00:03:47.069> some<00:03:47.189> x-rays<00:03:47.599> sometimes<00:03:48.599> the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
going to take some x-rays sometimes the

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.140 
going to take some x-rays sometimes the
patient<00:03:49.079> has<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:50.069> x-rays<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.699> if<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:50.939> have

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
patient has that x-rays and if they have

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.640 
patient has that x-rays and if they have
and<00:03:51.419> have<00:03:51.510> brought<00:03:51.750> them<00:03:51.930> with<00:03:51.959> them<00:03:52.109> then<00:03:52.469> we

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
and have brought them with them then we

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.729 
and have brought them with them then we
can<00:03:52.889> skip<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.220> part<00:03:53.959> we<00:03:54.959> also<00:03:55.109> examine<00:03:55.650> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
can skip that part we also examine the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.580 
can skip that part we also examine the
patient<00:03:56.569> typically<00:03:57.569> if<00:03:57.780> it's<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.139> hip<00:03:58.379> or<00:03:58.530> knee

patient typically if it's a hip or knee
examination<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.699> includes<00:04:00.060> range<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:01.019> motion

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
examination it includes range of motion

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.280 
examination it includes range of motion
