scrubbing<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.899> whipping

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
scrubbing a whipping

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
scrubbing a whipping
starting<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.179> baby<00:02:06.390> steps<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:07.160> repeating

starting out in baby steps and repeating

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390 
starting out in baby steps and repeating
that<00:02:08.429> process<00:02:09.360> through<00:02:10.289> repetition<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that process through repetition so you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.390 
that process through repetition so you
can<00:02:11.610> reprogram<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:13.049> nervous<00:02:13.410> system<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:14.190> do

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
can reprogram your nervous system to do

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.580 
can reprogram your nervous system to do
that<00:02:14.640> automatically<00:02:15.330> that's<00:02:16.110> what<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.440> all

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
that automatically that's what it's all

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.120 
that automatically that's what it's all
about

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
about

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.620 
about
so<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.860> fun<00:02:20.130> way<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> exercise<00:02:20.940> too

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
because I got a little loop here as you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.539 
because I got a little loop here as you
can<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.370> me<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.819> around<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
can see me going around it and I have to

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.240 
can see me going around it and I have to
pump<00:02:26.790> back<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.420> hill<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.930> I've<00:02:28.650> done<00:02:28.890> 30

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
pump back up the hill and I've done 30

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.550 
pump back up the hill and I've done 30
minute<00:02:29.549> workouts<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.049> it's<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.410> good

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
minute workouts on it and it's a good

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.740 
minute workouts on it and it's a good
workout<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.250> I'm<00:02:32.790> getting<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> practice<00:02:33.360> my

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
workout and I'm getting to practice my

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.050 
workout and I'm getting to practice my
jumping<00:02:34.140> at<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.290> same<00:02:34.560> time<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.790> use<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
jumping at the same time so use that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.640 
jumping at the same time so use that
strategy<00:02:36.510> when<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.019> want<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.260> learn<00:02:37.410> new

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
strategy when you want to learn new

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.009 
strategy when you want to learn new
techniques<00:02:38.359> that's<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.510> way<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.870> them

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
techniques that's the way to get them

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.069 
techniques that's the way to get them
down<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.760> be<00:02:41.760> able<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.269> them<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.870> fun

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
down and be able to do them and have fun

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.560 
down and be able to do them and have fun
doing<00:02:43.350> it
