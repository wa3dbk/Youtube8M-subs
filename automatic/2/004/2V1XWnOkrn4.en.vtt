you<00:02:16.450> know<00:02:16.540> I've<00:02:16.750> been<00:02:16.870> here<00:02:17.020> for<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.290> long<00:02:17.440> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you know I've been here for so long it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.380 
you know I've been here for so long it
doesn't<00:02:17.830> matter<00:02:17.980> I've<00:02:18.400> been<00:02:18.640> making<00:02:18.850> boards

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
doesn't matter I've been making boards

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.830 
doesn't matter I've been making boards
now<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:20.020> Oregon<00:02:20.260> probably<00:02:21.130> twice<00:02:21.820> as<00:02:22.150> long<00:02:22.480> if

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
now in Oregon probably twice as long if

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.020 
now in Oregon probably twice as long if
not<00:02:23.050> three<00:02:23.380> times<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:23.920> long<00:02:24.100> as<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.640> guy<00:02:24.820> in

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
not three times as long as the guy in

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.640 
not three times as long as the guy in
second<00:02:25.510> place<00:02:25.710> no<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:28.120> was<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> lone<00:02:28.930> ranger<00:02:28.959> for

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
second place no I was a lone ranger for

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.010 
second place no I was a lone ranger for
a<00:02:29.680> long<00:02:29.950> time<00:02:30.490> but<00:02:31.300> now<00:02:31.480> there<00:02:31.720> are<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.900> few

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
a long time but now there are a few

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.930 
a long time but now there are a few
surfboard<00:02:32.709> builders<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.340> northwest<00:02:33.820> and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
surfboard builders in the northwest and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.610 
surfboard builders in the northwest and
there's<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.180> lot<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.510> do-it-yourself<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:35.290> going

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
there's a lot of do-it-yourself in going

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.690 
there's a lot of do-it-yourself in going
on<00:02:35.740> now<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.520> that's<00:02:36.790> that's<00:02:37.060> cool<00:02:38.700> basically

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
on now and that's that's cool basically

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.070 
on now and that's that's cool basically
we<00:02:39.850> start<00:02:40.090> with<00:02:40.209> these<00:02:40.330> big<00:02:40.540> blocks<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.930> foam

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
we start with these big blocks of foam

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.790 
we start with these big blocks of foam
and<00:02:41.740> then<00:02:42.270> we<00:02:43.270> we<00:02:43.989> have<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.380> Hotwire

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
and then we we have this Hotwire

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.190 
and then we we have this Hotwire
technique<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:46.150> cuts<00:02:46.480> through<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.810> block<00:02:46.989> of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
technique that cuts through the block of

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.940 
technique that cuts through the block of
foam<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.560> creates<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.459> what<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.810> profile<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
foam and creates a what a profile of a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.979 
foam and creates a what a profile of a
surfboard<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.640> then<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.360> split<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.810> down<00:02:52.930> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
surfboard and then we split it down the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.199 
surfboard and then we split it down the
middle<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.560> we<00:02:54.070> put<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> wood<00:02:54.520> strip<00:02:54.820> down<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
middle and we put a wood strip down the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.600 
middle and we put a wood strip down the
center<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.720> that's<00:02:56.320> for<00:02:56.560> reinforcement<00:02:57.370> to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
center and that's for reinforcement to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.000 
center and that's for reinforcement to
give<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.180> board<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.690> more<00:02:59.020> resistance

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
give the board a little more resistance

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.310 
give the board a little more resistance
to<00:03:00.220> breakage<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.300> surf<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.959> next

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
to breakage and in the surf the next

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.340 
to breakage and in the surf the next
phase<00:03:02.560> we<00:03:03.130> put<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.730> outline<00:03:04.180> shape<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
phase we put the outline shape of the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.080 
phase we put the outline shape of the
surfboard<00:03:05.620> with<00:03:06.250> different<00:03:06.640> templates<00:03:07.000> that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
surfboard with different templates that

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.680 
surfboard with different templates that
I<00:03:07.239> made<00:03:07.420> over<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.720> course<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.080> time<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:09.690> in

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
I made over the course of time and in

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.420 
I made over the course of time and in
this<00:03:10.900> room<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.350> notable<00:03:11.800> because<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.280> is

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
this room is notable because this is

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.979 
this room is notable because this is
where<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> shaping<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.300> surfboard<00:03:13.510> or

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
where the shaping of the surfboard or

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.750 
where the shaping of the surfboard or
the<00:03:14.320> performance<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.370> board<00:03:15.610> is

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the performance of the board is

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.910 
the performance of the board is
determined<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:19.110> have<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.140> multitude<00:03:20.590> of

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
determined and I have a multitude of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.770 
determined and I have a multitude of
power<00:03:21.130> tools<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:21.940> use<00:03:22.150> for<00:03:22.450> different

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
power tools that I use for different

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.380 
power tools that I use for different
phases<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.440> taking<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.950> bulk<00:03:24.160> down<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.790> then

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
phases of taking the bulk down and then

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.470 
phases of taking the bulk down and then
a<00:03:25.750> series<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.410> hand<00:03:26.830> tools<00:03:27.160> sand<00:03:27.850> papers<00:03:28.299> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
a series of hand tools sand papers and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.630 
a series of hand tools sand papers and
things<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.500> an<00:03:29.650> even<00:03:30.010> fine

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
things like that for an even fine

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.070 
things like that for an even fine
sanding<00:03:31.269> screen<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:33.549> people<00:03:34.269> ask<00:03:34.630> me<00:03:34.900> how<00:03:35.049> we

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
sanding screen and people ask me how we

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.880 
sanding screen and people ask me how we
learned<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.500> shape<00:03:36.209> tell<00:03:37.209> my<00:03:37.480> shaping<00:03:38.350> foam<00:03:38.620> is

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
learned to shape tell my shaping foam is

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.920 
learned to shape tell my shaping foam is
easy<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.370> do<00:03:39.489> anyone<00:03:39.910> can<00:03:40.120> do<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.420> just<00:03:40.660> grab<00:03:40.900> a

chunk and rub on it you know I mean you
can<00:03:43.360> shape<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.780> right<00:03:44.049> if<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.650> physical<00:03:45.070> part

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
can shape it right if the physical part

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.940 
can shape it right if the physical part
is<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:46.030> easy<00:03:46.239> stuff<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:47.140> knowing<00:03:47.530> what<00:03:47.769> to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
is the easy stuff it's knowing what to

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.770 
is the easy stuff it's knowing what to
do<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.730> end<00:03:48.850> result<00:03:49.030> that's<00:03:49.570> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
base of the racks is probably more like

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.010 
base of the racks is probably more like
a<00:05:13.840> thousand<00:05:14.410> boards<00:05:14.740> we<00:05:15.610> break<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.330> off<00:05:16.690> and

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
a thousand boards we break this off and

a thousand boards we break this off and
throw<00:05:17.229> it<00:05:17.259> away<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.919> interestingly<00:05:18.910> enough

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
throw it away and interestingly enough

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.469 
throw it away and interestingly enough
the<00:05:19.780> DEQ<00:05:20.380> considers<00:05:21.130> this<00:05:21.310> organic<00:05:21.880> waste<00:05:22.150> and

the DEQ considers this organic waste and

the DEQ considers this organic waste and
it<00:05:23.050> actually<00:05:23.500> does<00:05:23.740> decompose<00:05:24.550> over<00:05:24.970> the

has been so fascinating to me the

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.300 
has been so fascinating to me the
combination<00:07:43.720> of<00:07:43.930> every<00:07:44.320> surfers<00:07:44.770> physical

uniqueness of the waves that they pursue
there<00:07:50.080> are<00:07:50.259> so<00:07:50.500> many<00:07:50.710> variations<00:07:51.039> in<00:07:51.580> that

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 
there are so many variations in that

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.060 
there are so many variations in that

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.150 
relationship that custom surfboards has
a<00:07:54.100> pretty<00:07:54.610> highly<00:07:55.300> useful<00:07:55.750> function<00:07:56.470> even<00:07:56.949> in

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.160 
a pretty highly useful function even in

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.759 
a pretty highly useful function even in
