00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
okay today we're gonna test out cog lens

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.029 
okay today we're gonna test out cog lens
fire<00:00:12.780> paste<00:00:15.080> I've<00:00:16.080> played<00:00:16.439> around<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
fire paste I've played around with this

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.970 
fire paste I've played around with this
a<00:00:17.100> little<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.490> already<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.500> it<00:00:19.500> seems<00:00:19.859> pretty

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
a little bit already and it seems pretty

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.730 
a little bit already and it seems pretty
good<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:23.300> there's<00:00:24.300> there's<00:00:25.110> quite<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> bit<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
good and there's there's quite a bit in

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.840 
good and there's there's quite a bit in
here<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:27.140> think<00:00:28.140> there's<00:00:28.500> enough<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> do

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
here so I think there's enough to do

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.450 
here so I think there's enough to do
what<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> need<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.770> depending<00:00:31.770> on<00:00:32.129> what

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
what you need to do depending on what

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.380 
what you need to do depending on what
the<00:00:32.609> conditions<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:33.359> and<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> item<00:00:36.000> number

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the conditions are and the item number

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
the conditions are and the item number
is<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> corner<00:00:40.260> eight<00:00:41.190> six

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is right there in the corner eight six

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.399 
is right there in the corner eight six
zero<00:00:41.640> seven<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.469> gonna<00:00:46.589> use<00:00:48.409> my

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
zero seven and then I'm gonna use my

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.879 
zero seven and then I'm gonna use my
Zippo<00:00:50.960> lighter<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.109> don't<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.469> which<00:00:52.649> one

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:52.889 
Zippo lighter I don't know which one

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.930 
Zippo lighter I don't know which one
they<00:00:53.039> call<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:55.370> because<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.489> bought<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
they call this because I bought this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.419 
they call this because I bought this
quite<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.569> few<00:00:57.780> years<00:00:58.049> ago<00:00:58.289> even<00:00:58.589> before<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.190> was

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
quite a few years ago even before I was

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.419 
quite a few years ago even before I was
interested<00:00:59.639> in<00:01:00.059> Zippo<00:01:00.479> products<00:01:01.309> but<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
interested in Zippo products but it

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.010 
interested in Zippo products but it
works<00:01:02.579> pretty<00:01:02.789> good<00:01:04.190> when<00:01:05.190> it's<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.489> windy<00:01:06.020> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
works pretty good when it's not windy it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.350 
works pretty good when it's not windy it
is<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> windy<00:01:07.710> today<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.240> be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is kind of windy today and this will be

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.970 
is kind of windy today and this will be
the<00:01:09.480> first<00:01:09.690> fire<00:01:10.140> test<00:01:10.500> I've<00:01:10.710> done

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
the first fire test I've done

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.010 
the first fire test I've done
fire-starting<00:01:11.940> test<00:01:12.390> I've<00:01:12.540> done<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
fire-starting test I've done where it's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
fire-starting test I've done where it's
actually<00:01:13.140> been<00:01:13.410> kind<00:01:13.620> of<00:01:13.680> windy<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:15.300> it's<00:01:15.450> not

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
actually been kind of windy so it's not

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010 
actually been kind of windy so it's not
quite<00:01:15.870> fair<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> product<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.120> if<00:01:18.870> it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
quite fair for this product but if it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.910 
quite fair for this product but if it
starts<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
starts up

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.970 
starts up
I<00:01:20.840> guess<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.110> conclude<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> does

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
I guess that will conclude that it does

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.240 
I guess that will conclude that it does
okay<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> wind<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.990> fire<00:01:25.230> pit<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
okay in the wind in a fire pit and the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.060 
okay in the wind in a fire pit and the
way<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.610> fire<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> built<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.710> let's<00:01:28.920> get

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
way the fire is built so let's get

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.430 
way the fire is built so let's get
started<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.850> has<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.420> uses<00:01:30.960> than<00:01:30.990> just

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
started this has more uses than just

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.790 
started this has more uses than just
starting<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.950> campfire<00:01:33.020> charcoal<00:01:34.020> fires<00:01:34.350> gas

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
starting a campfire charcoal fires gas

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.790 
starting a campfire charcoal fires gas
stoves<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.200> it's<00:01:37.200> supposed<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.620> pretty

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
stoves and it's supposed to be pretty

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.200 
stoves and it's supposed to be pretty
good<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.430> cold<00:01:38.700> weather<00:01:39.030> conditions

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.340 

it<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.810> says<00:01:44.120> squeeze<00:01:45.120> on<00:01:45.510> top<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.140> several

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it just says squeeze on top of several

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.940 
it just says squeeze on top of several
pieces<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:47.040> wood<00:01:47.250> light<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.180> paste<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:48.950> place

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
pieces of wood light the paste and place

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.180 
pieces of wood light the paste and place
additional<00:01:50.280> wood<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.970> top<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.740> definitely

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
additional wood on top so it definitely

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.790 
additional wood on top so it definitely
is<00:01:54.380> written<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.650> though<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.100> tinder<00:01:57.800> afire

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
is written as though it's a tinder afire

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.780 
is written as though it's a tinder afire
tinder<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.550> I'll<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.390> ahead<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.790> just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
tinder so I'll just go ahead and just

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:13.670 
tinder so I'll just go ahead and just
put<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.180> there

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.890 

the<00:02:14.489> caps<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.939> little<00:02:14.970> small<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:17.750> wouldn't<00:02:18.750> want

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the caps a little small I wouldn't want

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.720 
the caps a little small I wouldn't want
to<00:02:18.959> lose<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.310> got<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> little

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
to lose that and you it's got a little

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.130 
to lose that and you it's got a little
puncture<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:23.400> puncture<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.970> down

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.930 

so<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.160> guess<00:02:31.310> it's<00:02:31.490> just<00:02:31.670> kind<00:02:31.880> of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
so it's I guess it's just kind of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.470 
so it's I guess it's just kind of
guesswork<00:02:32.300> or<00:02:32.570> where<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.810> want<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.080> put<00:02:33.230> it

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.940 

Oh<00:02:40.940> probably<00:02:41.940> too<00:02:42.090> much

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.390 

ah<00:02:46.980> heck

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
ah heck

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
ah heck
I'll<00:02:49.909> just

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
I'll just

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.470 
I'll just
it's<00:02:51.960> not<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.440> expensive<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.310> I'll<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.670> put

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's not that expensive so I'll just put

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.400 
it's not that expensive so I'll just put
it<00:02:54.630> all<00:02:54.750> over<00:02:56.209> I'm<00:02:57.209> probably<00:02:57.510> over<00:02:57.900> killing<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
it all over I'm probably over killing it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.480 
it all over I'm probably over killing it
but<00:02:59.870> lies<00:03:00.870> will<00:03:01.110> give<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.470> chance<00:03:01.740> now<00:03:02.220> it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
but lies will give it a chance now it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.010 
but lies will give it a chance now it
looks<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.940> flame<00:03:03.240> might<00:03:03.450> not<00:03:03.630> be<00:03:03.810> big

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
looks like the flame might not be big

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.640 
looks like the flame might not be big
enough<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.410> light<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.620> kindling<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> maybe

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
enough to light the kindling so maybe

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.860 
enough to light the kindling so maybe
I'll<00:03:07.800> put<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> little<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.610> kindling

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:21.740 

see<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.080> sticks<00:03:13.380> upside<00:03:13.800> down<00:03:19.459> yeah<00:03:20.750> yeah

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
see if it sticks upside down yeah yeah

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.280 
see if it sticks upside down yeah yeah
it<00:03:21.870> doesn't<00:03:22.110> come<00:03:22.230> off<00:03:23.720> we'll<00:03:24.720> put<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.110> right

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it doesn't come off we'll put that right

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.550 
it doesn't come off we'll put that right
there<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.840> say<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.410> probably

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
there I have to say this is probably

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.880 
there I have to say this is probably
more<00:03:32.160> one<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.239> fun<00:03:33.600> fire<00:03:34.410> starters

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
more one of the more fun fire starters

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.410 
more one of the more fun fire starters
to<00:03:35.040> play<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.610> mean<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:36.030> smear<00:03:36.390> it

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
to play with I mean you just smear it

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:47.479 
to play with I mean you just smear it
wherever<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.900> want<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.100> guess<00:03:47.340> we'll

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
wherever you want it but I guess we'll

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.070 
wherever you want it but I guess we'll
find<00:03:47.730> out<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.060> second<00:03:48.450> whether<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.050> a

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
find out in a second whether this is a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.000 
find out in a second whether this is a
something<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.190> play<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.610> or<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.090> actually

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
something to play with or if it actually

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.979 
something to play with or if it actually
does<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.220> trick<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:53.640> igniting<00:03:54.150> something

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:14.999 

okay

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.009 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.439 

okay<00:04:16.009> so<00:04:16.070> I've<00:04:16.250> probably<00:04:16.459> used<00:04:16.639> ten<00:04:17.150> times

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
okay so I've probably used ten times

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:25.180 
okay so I've probably used ten times
more<00:04:17.810> than<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.109> needed<00:04:19.600> but<00:04:20.600> oh<00:04:20.750> well<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:25.100> I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
more than I needed but oh well so like I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.590 
more than I needed but oh well so like I
said<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.460> just<00:04:25.490> kind<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.880> guesswork<00:04:26.240> or<00:04:26.449> where

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
said it just kind of guesswork or where

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.110 
said it just kind of guesswork or where
to<00:04:26.630> put<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:28.100> I'm<00:04:28.460> gonna<00:04:28.639> light<00:04:28.789> it<00:04:28.910> up<00:04:29.030> and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
to put it so I'm gonna light it up and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:39.540 
to put it so I'm gonna light it up and
see<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:29.449> what<00:04:29.780> happens

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.340 

okay<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.760> lighted<00:04:41.180> kind<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.510> high<00:04:41.690> we'll<00:04:42.110> see

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
okay so I lighted kind of high we'll see

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.330 
okay so I lighted kind of high we'll see
if<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.590> spreads<00:04:42.980> down<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:45.070> rest<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.220> it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
if it spreads down to the rest of it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.660 
if it spreads down to the rest of it
that's<00:04:46.550> down<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.780> that<00:04:48.470> bottom<00:04:48.860> piece<00:04:49.040> okay<00:04:49.610> so

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
that's down on that bottom piece okay so

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.320 
that's down on that bottom piece okay so
the<00:04:49.880> winds<00:04:50.150> blowing<00:04:50.420> it<00:04:51.670> yep<00:04:52.700> it's<00:04:52.940> lighting

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
the winds blowing it yep it's lighting

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:13.880 
the winds blowing it yep it's lighting
it

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.580 

whoa<00:05:14.890> I<00:05:15.600> don't<00:05:16.600> know<00:05:16.780> if<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.020> was<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.350> wood

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
whoa I don't know if that was the wood

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.340 
whoa I don't know if that was the wood
or<00:05:17.980> the<00:05:19.890> cog<00:05:20.890> lens<00:05:21.130> paste<00:05:21.960> kind<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.140> cool

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
or the cog lens paste kind of a cool

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:40.439 
or the cog lens paste kind of a cool
sound

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.110 

now<00:05:41.449> it's<00:05:42.259> just<00:05:42.379> a<00:05:42.529> little<00:05:42.770> over<00:05:42.979> four<00:05:43.249> minutes

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.640 

it's<00:05:47.120> fast<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:50.120> course<00:05:50.360> I<00:05:50.629> used<00:05:50.870> a<00:05:51.020> whole<00:05:51.199> lot<00:05:51.409> I

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.800 
it's fast of course I used a whole lot I
think<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.430> wasted<00:05:52.669> quite<00:05:53.509> a<00:05:53.599> bit<00:05:53.870> but<00:05:55.659> at<00:05:56.659> least

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
think I wasted quite a bit but at least

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:11.550 
think I wasted quite a bit but at least
you<00:05:57.020> can<00:05:57.169> vary<00:05:57.469> how<00:05:57.680> much<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:58.039> want<00:05:58.249> to<00:05:58.340> put<00:05:58.460> on

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.869 

okay<00:06:12.560> so<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.860> can<00:06:13.099> tell<00:06:13.310> that<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:13.580> winds

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
one of those fire starters that's kind

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.180 
one of those fire starters that's kind
of<00:06:45.920> fun<00:06:46.190> to<00:06:46.340> apply<00:06:47.530> because<00:06:48.530> you<00:06:48.770> you<00:06:49.070> know

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
of fun to apply because you you know

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
it's kind of entertaining to put it on

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
it's kind of entertaining to put it on
like<00:06:52.430> toothpaste<00:06:53.000> and<00:06:53.240> then<00:06:53.330> light<00:06:53.510> it<00:06:53.660> up

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.550 

so<00:07:00.420> I'll<00:07:00.570> go<00:07:00.690> ahead<00:07:00.810> and<00:07:00.960> stop<00:07:01.140> it<00:07:01.320> here<00:07:01.530> and

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
so I'll go ahead and stop it here and

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.080 
so I'll go ahead and stop it here and
then<00:07:01.830> we'll<00:07:02.070> see<00:07:02.220> if<00:07:02.310> it's<00:07:02.430> still<00:07:02.580> burning<00:07:02.970> in

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.560 
then we'll see if it's still burning in
after<00:07:03.540> a<00:07:03.570> little<00:07:03.720> while<00:07:05.000> so<00:07:06.000> it's<00:07:06.210> been<00:07:06.390> about
