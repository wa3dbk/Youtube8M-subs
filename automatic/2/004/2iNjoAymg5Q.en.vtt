but<00:02:25.530> we're<00:02:25.650> gonna<00:02:25.769> pull<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.099> just<00:02:26.219> a<00:02:26.340> little

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
but we're gonna pull up just a little

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.580 
but we're gonna pull up just a little
bit<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.719> strings<00:02:28.019> are<00:02:28.230> no<00:02:28.349> longer

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
bit so that the strings are no longer

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.349 
bit so that the strings are no longer
touching<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> frets<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.640> then<00:02:29.939> we<00:02:30.090> get<00:02:30.209> this

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
touching the frets and then we get this

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.339 
touching the frets and then we get this
kind<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.689> percussive<00:02:31.200> muted<00:02:31.560> sound<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.200> got

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
kind of percussive muted sound so we got

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.789 
kind of percussive muted sound so we got
down<00:02:34.859> down<00:02:35.819> up<00:02:36.769> down<00:02:38.299> up<00:02:39.500> down

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
down down up down up down

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.770 
down down up down up down
whew<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.629> down<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:44.030> down<00:02:45.030> down<00:02:45.299> up<00:02:46.159> down

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
whew you down down up down down up down

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.330 
whew you down down up down down up down
mute<00:02:48.780> music<00:02:49.319> then<00:02:49.469> we're<00:02:49.590> gonna<00:02:49.680> transition

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
mute music then we're gonna transition

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.520 
mute music then we're gonna transition
over<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.239> an<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.500> major<00:02:52.769> seven<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.930> same<00:02:55.230> kind<00:02:55.470> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
over to an a major seven so same kind of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.349 
over to an a major seven so same kind of
principle<00:02:55.650> here<00:02:56.129> with<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.819> couple<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.299> these

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
principle here with a couple of these

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.089 
principle here with a couple of these
strings<00:02:57.659> being<00:02:57.900> muted<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.470> that's<00:02:58.620> important

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
strings being muted and that's important

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:15.740 
strings being muted and that's important
one<00:02:59.970> two<00:03:00.450> three<00:03:01.109> go<00:03:14.180> alright<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.299> tutorials

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
one two three go alright this tutorials

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
we'll do the slide work in its own

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.199 
we'll do the slide work in its own
tutorial<00:03:19.409> so<00:03:20.220> I'll<00:03:20.310> play<00:03:20.459> through<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.760> solo
