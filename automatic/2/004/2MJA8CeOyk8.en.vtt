 speak good the truth is that there was a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.490
 group of people behind me and I was sorry 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.630

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.670
 I am very quiet this day all the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.680
 animals were loose by the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.960
 zoo was crazy you were going 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.520
 walking and you see a fucking reign and if 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.390
 the wey is usually a deer going to 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.980
 kill but the deer kill him so 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.680
 I'm very quiet the long day all that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.750
 happened in a single day and being sincere 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.640
 of the videos I already had for this 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.100
 week did not have miners so I do not know 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.020

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.600
 give a little what I did for my girlfriend 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.640
 in this vacation that was like 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.959

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.090
 gone so now all that remains of my 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.430
 crumbs of the video that are watching me 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.440
 I'm looking at a little corner here that's 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.000
 the animal then we saw the black jaguar 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.230
 that was very bastard that was the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.450
 main attraction 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.030
 We went to the chiapas zoo they know that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.220
 I'm in Chiapas because I'm good at 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.540
 chiapas and that the sun 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.300
 because I was very loaded I had 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.450
 taken from the little one I remember seeing 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.880
 all the animals that go the chingÃ³n 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.410
 is that all the animals go like 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.670
 I tell them you are walking and suddenly 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.350

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.390

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.520
 you not only find animals that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.710
 they are domesticated and they are loaded 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.020
 as they saw on the screen the first one I think 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.410
 but it is a rare bird the first one that had 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.260
 his yellow trunk then I do not remember 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.230
 what else did we see something was like a 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.120
 amazing super pig and at the beginning of 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.510

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.880

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.459
