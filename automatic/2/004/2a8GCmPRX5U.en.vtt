I feel like I might have had like a

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.569 
I feel like I might have had like a
little<00:02:41.470> bit<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.590> conversation<00:02:42.099> but<00:02:42.190> not<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
little bit of conversation but not that

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.740 
little bit of conversation but not that
much<00:02:42.819> or<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.239> much

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
much or not this much

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.930 
much or not this much
but<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.950> interesting<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.579> like<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
but it's interesting I like the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.550 
but it's interesting I like the
character<00:02:46.299> who<00:02:46.420> they<00:02:46.540> cost<00:02:46.750> ram<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.230> think<00:02:47.410> he

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
character who they cost ram I think he

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.860 
character who they cost ram I think he
fits<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> description<00:02:48.549> that's<00:02:49.269> kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
fits the description that's kind of the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.420 
fits the description that's kind of the
feel<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.200> character<00:02:50.500> which<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.739> good<00:02:50.950> also

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
feel of the character which is good also

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.000 
feel of the character which is good also
they're<00:02:52.269> kind<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.480> matching<00:02:52.870> in<00:02:53.319> this<00:02:53.620> picture

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
they're kind of matching in this picture

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.830 
they're kind of matching in this picture
so<00:02:54.780> that's<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.870> third<00:02:56.109> maybe<00:02:56.980> parallels<00:02:57.970> no

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
so that's a third maybe parallels no

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.370 
so that's a third maybe parallels no
okay
