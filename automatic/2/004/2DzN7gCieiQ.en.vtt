classic man-copter game it feels like

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.840 
classic man-copter game it feels like
generals<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.770> core<00:00:36.980> concepts<00:00:37.519> in<00:00:37.670> the

original command and conquer RTS games
were<00:00:40.399> really<00:00:40.670> about<00:00:40.879> building<00:00:41.210> a<00:00:41.510> base

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
were really about building a base

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.869 
were really about building a base
defending<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:42.710> base<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.219> building<00:00:43.789> an

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
defending that base and building an

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.340 
defending that base and building an
assault<00:00:44.179> to<00:00:44.359> army<00:00:44.629> that<00:00:44.749> you<00:00:44.839> could<00:00:44.989> go<00:00:45.079> attack

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
assault to army that you could go attack

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.009 
assault to army that you could go attack
the<00:00:45.649> other<00:00:45.800> base<00:00:45.949> first<00:00:46.429> thing<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.789> said<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.300> we

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
the other base first thing we said is we

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.169 
the other base first thing we said is we
need<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.319> kind<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.589> wash<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:49.339> stain<00:00:49.609> of<00:00:49.639> CNC

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
need to kind of wash the stain of CNC

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.419 
need to kind of wash the stain of CNC
far<00:00:50.389> away<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.440> do<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:51.589> you<00:00:51.769> really<00:00:52.280> have

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
far away and to do that you really have

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.069 
far away and to do that you really have
to<00:00:52.519> get<00:00:52.639> back<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.879> your<00:00:53.120> roots<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.479> get<00:00:53.719> back<00:00:53.899> to
