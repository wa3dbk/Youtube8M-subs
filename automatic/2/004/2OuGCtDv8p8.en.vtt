00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 So you want of here till min 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:57.350
 That if the most that kinda lose the racer but I thought Sodesune' net Te Patti 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:01.200
 When the sun gets rough , you'll suddenly be in shape ぇ I was a little worried but aki 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 Not the best state in the form was that mark is 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.830
 I think it's not the cost of it, so it's up to here 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.680
 I would like to ask you to look back for a little more 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.170
 enjoy Well finished how tight is it 8 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.550
 In the foot bath 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.070
 And it may be legs to go 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 It feels like the final growth of the last can only be done by a good person 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.940
 But the Soviet Union 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.740
 here Niño 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.700
 Kedomo It was bought Great Buddha of earth course I think that one course where there is a fairly high Advantage 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.980
 Those of slaves I think Yeah it is a battle of the Well my What once 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.260
 How high the initial pressure 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:05.090
 From an inner feeling outside eh pressure not sound at that yourself 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:09.020
 I think it is okay if I do not fail I will go to the bride and good results for the Challenge Cup 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.600
 And this jerk at the last minute to come to leave 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.520
 Kedomo I scene that going into the top 10 was seen is said to be so far several times 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:22.950
 If it is my own, I would like to have a Challenge Cup 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:28.770
 I guess it's probably because it's cool, but with the basic part that propeller with its propeller 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.780
 Became cool from the b Studio is like that and the adjustment method of that suits me 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 I think that is not 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.239
 In the inside of this, I wondered if it was a good match in the button area and there was also a queen award 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.630
 Oh yeah I 'm always 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.470
 I wish I should hear the consequences 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.000
 I think, but there is strong waste and whether there is also a variety ne pressure by me is in 15 tomorrow 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.590
 Thank you for your message 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.180

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.110
 It appears with mass directly below 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:08.670
 Mr. Shigeru Matsui obtained thank you in advance 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.580
 Foot mass of look back now clause 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:18.210
 It is normal that the feet are normal 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:23.580
 I think there are no other people out there so I think they are all languages 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:26.330
 Determine the start of Honma 11 in fine and graduating class members Once the net by amazing Oshima's stomach 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.330
 Was I Kedomo 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.380
 Damn to start 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:37.810
 Well I think the start is going to work 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.810
 It is a feeling that it feels like it's not bad either. 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.650
 Hey That's right 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.160
 Well practice taste a little in conjunction First there is a little reed Kedomo do not know be that good 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.570
 I do not know 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.570
 My head is not this year 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.310
 Well, I think some people are worried about their fans but 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.099
 Hmmm 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.099
 It was a feeling that a race unique to town was made 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:09.760
 There is a painful part if you go down to the time before the decision and it is said that you are upset 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.160
 Well Well propeller Nde only doing fine full 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.519
 I You There is also a rhythm Well 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.239
 Although there is a part where biting was a little bad 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.700
 Oh that's also a race, yes 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.380
 It was that Kokarada tomorrow Kedomo I was decided victory against members while skipping 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.490
 Male Dolly Toka also Well 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.960
 I want to feel it from the coach though I think that there is also a creation 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.960
 I wish the aim of that championship 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:56.639
 go to use n 4 day 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.200
 It's like pressure in this important battle 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:04.450
 That's right ぇ there were many 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.450
 I wonder what type you feel nervous about 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.240
 Also take space with a reasonable sense of tension is also not I do it and say Which one 's better to 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.139
 The 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:18.710
 Well I think it is good 10 for the first time in a long time I think this tension doubles 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.189
 What was that free race starter 3 so far 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.200
 That the earlier bugs be passed through a series 08 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.310
 I have one step into 0 but 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.640
 After all 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.230
 What is the concentration on this year's bass series? 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.529
 Will also make a new factory 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:39.159
 Well , I had thought that I was not fully focused 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:41.820
 Well, I generally think that most master-slave is made of good condition 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:45.570
 Talk to those who have the power to feel that 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.770
 But what does it look like it's finished? 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:53.790
 Tatari 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:57.190
 I can understand the start-up relationship I think that it is a b- type from the reed as well as the middle rank top end 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:01.900
 After all this power that side results 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:04.120
 It feels like I'm good and it grows more than people with various numbers 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.840
 I think it is a little different 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.540
 A person who is b 10 c is still a little bit better when it comes to a real day comparison 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.830
 I think that I do not care so much Yes 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.840
 In the matter of the current championship 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:22.090
 Please be unconscious to a little another of the side taking advantage of the Vicky's is 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:26.040
 It is not keep Enough p about 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:31.320
 Yes Yes Read now the foot of'll it firmly back tomorrow 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.800
 Bake the unicorn that will do our best but to I March two I that is when Mr. year that this t-shirt 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.479
 Pizza is high 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.340
 It is towards the northeast is properly made things would I land of Yukari that there was 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.750
 Collaboration 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.060
 I think I've been fighting with a year-long light with a variety of thoughts, but this is up to here 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.129
 So 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.780
 Well Eemaa I even a little 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:55.930
 For revival 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:07:00.840
 I'd have thought that a be nice when you are called or force what you'll ne help 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:03.910
 First of all, I think that I will leave the result on it 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:08.410
 Well, in that sense the keynote lasted a little more recently 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.550
 If we Well to continue all the way such good condition also do so because they think it is many things 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.610
 You also feel that I want do my best even in the sense that 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:18.080
 It will also be high amateur voice but believing towards the fan 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:21.300
