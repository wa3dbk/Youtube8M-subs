00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 between these two flags to remind you 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360

 where to find a guy that I hope 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.289
 It does not bother me that it should 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.289
 to be looking for too 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.590

 keep secret is not right here right 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.280
 It gives me a good faith 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.690
 the guy is already up elly already looking 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.880

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.049

 he does not kill me who come here 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:01.069
 and there are those two boxes here 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:03.920
 search here and here it's okay to see 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:07.810
 where has already angry banner then you 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.810
 already goes to the brave flag already 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:22.590
 osorio copy that i'll show the touch 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.430
 facing the brave flag here 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.159
 facing her down the listing here 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 this tower you see there is and flags 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.340
 here at the foot of this rock here 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.489
 Okay, right there on the other side, we'll go there. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.579
 on the other hand of that tunick the title 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.900
 here pilot exclusion now gives a 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.190
 cut in video to get faster 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.900
 So, guys, we're here on the other side. 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.459
 of the brave flag here we were in a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.859
 end of the tunnel takes a look at the mini 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.760
 map to have the least you see the 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.530
 position 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.709
 This is another way out so you will 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.700
 having to get up here gives a way 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.829
 climb on this little trick here too 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.810
 It's not so easy, but it's not as easy. 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.400
 sure not like that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.400
 You can come by helicopter too. 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:21.139
 came up here 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:23.220
 so far the position here is well here 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.350
 popular here under the door for you 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.230
 go door down here 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.420
 then our position is that there ben 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.000
 people try to find is among their 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.560
 brave positions and now we go there 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.570
 meaning 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.490
 I'll take another cut to get more 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.580
 fast there then the staff we are 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.420
 here on the flag delton doing has end 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.800
 The ball here, I know what this is here. 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.960
 well on the delta flag 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.100
 so here you will look at these places 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:04:00.430
 here o 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:02.260
 the pillars here and here it's cool 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:08.830
 tricycle of affection that I killed here 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:14.440
 pt of being own flag he is going to 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.170
 another point on the map that is the most recent 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.580
 of the flag efe 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.770
 and in the middle of the way we 'll find 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.830
 an accommodation that I think is a species 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.220
 where you find the power 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.860
 gum 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.200
 Okay, okay, I have on the way that 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.390
 people and the delta on the way to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.870
 flag epoch in accommodation here 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:42.280
 and it's around here around here 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.140
 accommodation here 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.230
 and between these boxes here are also 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.760
 between the boxes and there in the housing 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.920
 now come to you here in 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.700
 flag now maybe our flag 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.560
 is it you realize that you have an allied tractor 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 look at the mini map the place that people 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.700
 is then you come here on tractor 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.770
 and go look around here 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.310
 ok there are other places on this map here 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.689
 personnel found there 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.560
 looking for a neighbor and I'm going to show 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.560
 for you too 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:32.590
 then you will use the maio nÃ© because it is 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.499
 white is when this map should be 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.300
 you find very difficult then 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:41.819
 Suggestion also is you and looking for 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.819
 a neighbor is missing the map there 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:50.259
 on the top so it's not that easy 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.789
 so when to find but not in 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.860

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.930
