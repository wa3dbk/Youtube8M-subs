that doesn't really Bluff and you don't

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
think you would value about a hand like

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.440 
think you would value about a hand like
Jack's<00:01:12.590> queens<00:01:12.829> or<00:01:13.189> Kings<00:01:13.399> then<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.240> should

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
Jack's queens or Kings then you should

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.910 
Jack's queens or Kings then you should
probably<00:01:14.570> bet<00:01:14.929> about<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.200> hundred<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.649> twenty

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
probably bet about a hundred and twenty

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.109 
probably bet about a hundred and twenty
and<00:01:16.039> hope<00:01:16.399> to<00:01:16.429> get<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.700> call

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
and hope to get a call

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.419 
and hope to get a call
however<00:01:17.630> most<00:01:18.499> players<00:01:18.799> don't<00:01:19.130> fit<00:01:19.310> that

clear<00:04:28.110> message<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:29.009> because<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.460> checked<00:04:29.669> the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
clear message just because I checked the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.640 
clear message just because I checked the
river<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.570> doesn't<00:04:30.960> mean<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.080> have<00:04:31.139> nothing

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
river it doesn't mean I have nothing

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.740 
river it doesn't mean I have nothing
okay<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.370> continue<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:33.150> play<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.330> style

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
okay I continue to play that style

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.879 
okay I continue to play that style
against<00:04:34.110> them<00:04:34.229> out<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.410> position<00:04:34.770> and

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
against them out of position and

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.260 
against them out of position and
eventually<00:04:35.310> he<00:04:35.639> did<00:04:35.850> make<00:04:36.060> an<00:04:36.180> adjustment

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
eventually he did make an adjustment

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.450 
eventually he did make an adjustment
that's<00:04:37.050> precisely<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:38.009> I<00:04:38.039> was<00:04:38.160> hoping<00:04:38.400> for

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
that's precisely what I was hoping for

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.580 
that's precisely what I was hoping for
he<00:04:39.120> had<00:04:39.210> picked<00:04:39.479> up<00:04:39.600> on<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.780> tendency<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.470> play

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
he had picked up on my tendency to play

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.350 
he had picked up on my tendency to play
cautiously<00:04:41.070> on<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.280> river<00:04:41.430> by<00:04:41.820> checking<00:04:42.240> and

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
cautiously on the river by checking and

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.120 
cautiously on the river by checking and
calling<00:04:42.720> which<00:04:42.840> forced<00:04:43.560> him<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.740> change<00:04:43.860> his

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
calling which forced him to change his

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.010 
calling which forced him to change his
strategy<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.639> avoid<00:04:45.120> making<00:04:45.330> value<00:04:45.840> bets

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
strategy and avoid making value bets

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.870

with<00:04:46.169> hands<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.590> he'd<00:04:46.740> normally<00:04:46.889> bet<00:04:47.310> the

adjustment he made actually saved me

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.590

lots<00:04:49.979> of<00:04:50.130> river<00:04:50.370> bets<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.669> situations<00:04:51.210> where<00:04:51.389> I

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
lots of river bets in situations where I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600 
lots of river bets in situations where I
would<00:04:51.960> have<00:04:52.050> called<00:04:52.229> but<00:04:52.800> didn't<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:53.430> to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
would have called but didn't have to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.550 
would have called but didn't have to
since<00:04:53.850> he<00:04:53.940> checked<00:04:54.210> here's<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:55.080> hand<00:04:55.320> from

later in that same session he raised
before<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.590> flop<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.039> I<00:04:59.280> called<00:04:59.550> with<00:04:59.699> 10-8

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
before the flop and I called with 10-8

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.020 
before the flop and I called with 10-8
the<00:05:00.630> flop<00:05:00.840> came<00:05:01.110> Jack<00:05:01.440> 10-6<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:02.190> checked<00:05:02.880> he

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
the flop came Jack 10-6 I checked he

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.600 
the flop came Jack 10-6 I checked he
made<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> small<00:05:03.449> bet<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:04.470> turn<00:05:04.710> was<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.190> seven

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
made a small bet the turn was a seven

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.760 
made a small bet the turn was a seven
and<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.030> checked<00:05:06.360> as<00:05:06.539> did<00:05:06.870> he<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.470> river<00:05:07.620> was

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
and I checked as did he the river was

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.159 
and I checked as did he the river was
another<00:05:07.979> six<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.389> went<00:05:09.539> check<00:05:09.780> check<00:05:10.020> on

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
another six and it went check check on

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:10.640 
another six and it went check check on
the<00:05:10.259> river

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
the river

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.529 
the river
I<00:05:10.680> showed<00:05:11.190> my<00:05:11.220> pair<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:11.789> he<00:05:11.849> turned<00:05:12.060> over<00:05:12.150> king

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
I showed my pair and he turned over king

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.379 
I showed my pair and he turned over king
10<00:05:12.810> now<00:05:13.440> this<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.099> a<00:05:14.130> hand<00:05:14.430> he<00:05:14.610> clearly<00:05:15.120> would

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
10 now this is a hand he clearly would

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.969 
10 now this is a hand he clearly would
have<00:05:15.509> bet<00:05:15.660> for<00:05:15.840> value<00:05:15.870> earlier<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.889> the

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
have bet for value earlier in the

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.460 
have bet for value earlier in the
session<00:05:17.190> but<00:05:17.639> I<00:05:17.669> trained<00:05:18.060> him<00:05:18.210> not<00:05:18.419> to<00:05:18.630> the

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
session but I trained him not to the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.200 
session but I trained him not to the
strategy<00:05:19.949> is<00:05:20.070> incomplete<00:05:20.520> though<00:05:20.699> unless<00:05:21.060> I

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
strategy is incomplete though unless I

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.089 
strategy is incomplete though unless I
also<00:05:21.449> make<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:22.080> minor<00:05:22.289> adjustment<00:05:22.440> myself

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
also make a minor adjustment myself

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.219 
also make a minor adjustment myself
knowing<00:05:23.789> that<00:05:24.030> I've<00:05:24.120> loved<00:05:24.509> my<00:05:24.690> opponent<00:05:25.139> -

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
knowing that I've loved my opponent -

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.480 
knowing that I've loved my opponent -
checking<00:05:25.590> down<00:05:25.680> marginal<00:05:26.130> hands<00:05:26.280> on<00:05:26.430> the

river

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.390 
river
I<00:05:26.940> had<00:05:27.389> to<00:05:27.539> now<00:05:27.690> bet<00:05:28.020> my<00:05:28.169> own<00:05:28.349> Hanser<00:05:28.740> value<00:05:29.099> at

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
I had to now bet my own Hanser value at

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.830 
I had to now bet my own Hanser value at
a<00:05:29.490> slightly<00:05:29.789> higher<00:05:29.910> percentage<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.539> the<00:05:30.660> time

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
a slightly higher percentage of the time

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.870 
a slightly higher percentage of the time
on<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.139> river<00:05:31.530> it's<00:05:32.310> like<00:05:32.520> a<00:05:32.550> cat-and-mouse

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
on the river it's like a cat-and-mouse

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.730 
on the river it's like a cat-and-mouse
game<00:05:33.419> that's<00:05:33.630> played<00:05:33.750> on<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:33.990> regular<00:05:34.349> basis

more<00:05:34.919> specifically<00:05:35.699> when<00:05:35.880> playing<00:05:36.060> heads<00:05:36.300> up

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
in sticking with the small ball concept

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.820 
in sticking with the small ball concept
though<00:05:38.909> you<00:05:39.330> always<00:05:39.900> want<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.169> try<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:40.530> tame
