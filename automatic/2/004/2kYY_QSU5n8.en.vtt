now<00:01:33.259> what's<00:01:34.159> interesting<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:34.850> this

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
now what's interesting is that this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.149 
now what's interesting is that this
could<00:01:35.780> be<00:01:35.930> some<00:01:36.170> part<00:01:36.469> of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.619> campaign

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
could be some part of the campaign

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.279 
could be some part of the campaign
vision<00:01:37.789> or<00:01:38.000> campaign<00:01:38.479> mission<00:01:38.840> where<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
vision or campaign mission where the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.840 
vision or campaign mission where the
people<00:01:39.469> are<00:01:39.649> sick<00:01:40.100> or<00:01:40.280> something<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.729> you're

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
people are sick or something and you're

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.550 
people are sick or something and you're
escorting<00:01:41.299> them<00:01:41.570> that's<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:42.049> possibility

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
escorting them that's a possibility

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.679 
escorting them that's a possibility
another<00:01:43.430> possibility<00:01:43.969> is<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.509> could<00:01:44.659> be

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
another possibility is that it could be

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.069 
another possibility is that it could be
their<00:01:45.409> quote<00:01:45.890> unquote<00:01:46.009> zombie<00:01:46.820> mode<00:01:47.090> but

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
their quote unquote zombie mode but

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.260 
their quote unquote zombie mode but
maybe<00:01:48.320> something<00:01:48.619> different<00:01:49.130> maybe<00:01:49.159> it's<00:01:49.850> a

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
maybe something different maybe it's a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.920 
maybe something different maybe it's a
play<00:01:50.930> maybe<00:01:51.880> it's<00:01:52.880> like<00:01:53.240> sort<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.630> something

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
play maybe it's like sort of something

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.109 
play maybe it's like sort of something
like<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.200> last<00:01:54.469> ship<00:01:54.829> anyone<00:01:55.729> know<00:01:55.820> what<00:01:55.939> I'm

will ultimately kill you that's one
possibility<00:02:24.459> i<00:02:24.640> think<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:25.000> camino<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.989> know

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
possibility i think that camino you know

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.410 
possibility i think that camino you know
like<00:02:26.260> they're<00:02:26.500> they're<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.250> zombies<00:02:27.459> they're

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
like they're they're not zombies they're

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.000 
like they're they're not zombies they're
infected<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.349> i've<00:02:29.440> been<00:02:29.470> i've<00:02:29.950> been

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
infected and i've been i've been

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.979 
infected and i've been i've been
pampering<00:02:30.640> down<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.120> possibility<00:02:31.599> for<00:02:31.900> a

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
pampering down this possibility for a

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.380 
pampering down this possibility for a
while<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:33.099> that's<00:02:33.310> probably<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.330> good

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
while I think that's probably a good

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.300 
while I think that's probably a good
method<00:02:34.930> for<00:02:35.230> them<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.470> go<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.010> mean<00:02:36.160> it's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
method for them to go with I mean it's

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.940 
method for them to go with I mean it's
not<00:02:36.489> zombies<00:02:37.060> but<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:37.870> pretty<00:02:38.170> damn<00:02:38.440> similar

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
not zombies but it's pretty damn similar

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890 
not zombies but it's pretty damn similar
and<00:02:39.160> they<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.489> go<00:02:39.730> where<00:02:40.000> they<00:02:40.239> want<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.720> it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
and they can go where they want with it

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.150 
and they can go where they want with it
I<00:02:41.110> don't<00:02:41.560> know<00:02:41.620> if<00:02:41.709> they're<00:02:41.830> gonna<00:02:41.890> do<00:02:42.129> that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
I don't know if they're gonna do that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.770 
I don't know if they're gonna do that
though<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.700> know<00:02:42.819> that's<00:02:43.120> not<00:02:43.239> exactly<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.720> I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
though I know that's not exactly what I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.449 
though I know that's not exactly what I
think<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.290> think<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.650> been<00:02:44.769> something<00:02:45.069> kind

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
think I think it's been something kind

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.910 
think I think it's been something kind
of<00:02:45.549> like<00:02:45.730> dead<00:02:46.030> space<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.530> guess<00:02:47.739> we'll

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
of like dead space but I guess we'll

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.199 
of like dead space but I guess we'll
just<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.099> to<00:02:48.190> wait<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.519> find<00:02:48.549> out<00:02:48.819> but<00:02:49.030> just

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
just have to wait to find out but just

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.160 
just have to wait to find out but just
tell<00:02:49.420> me<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.690> guys<00:02:49.780> think<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:50.049> these
