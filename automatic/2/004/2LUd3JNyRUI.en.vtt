to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> nether<00:01:31.740> screenshot<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:33.119> have

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to the nether screenshot here we have

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
to the nether screenshot here we have
the<00:01:33.390> gas<00:01:33.630> flying<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> air<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.650> people

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the gas flying up in the air and people

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
the gas flying up in the air and people
are<00:01:35.100> saying<00:01:35.340> they<00:01:35.460> might<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> Watchers<00:01:36.329> or

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
are saying they might be Watchers or

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
are saying they might be Watchers or
they<00:01:36.930> might<00:01:37.110> also<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.680> engineers<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.970> if

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
they might also be engineers and then if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.760 
they might also be engineers and then if
we<00:01:39.150> take<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> look<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> blaze<00:01:40.140> over<00:01:40.560> there

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
we take a look at the blaze over there

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
we take a look at the blaze over there
people<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.700> saying<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> might<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
people are saying that that might be a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.200 
people are saying that that might be a
watcher<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.159> everything's<00:01:44.820> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
watcher I don't know everything's just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
watcher I don't know everything's just
kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.840> air<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.680> textures

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
kind of up in the air here the textures

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
kind of up in the air here the textures
are<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.670> cool<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.720> these

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
are really really cool but some of these

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.200 
are really really cool but some of these
are<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.649> hard<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> distinguish<00:01:50.610> what

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
are kind of hard to distinguish what

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
are kind of hard to distinguish what
they<00:01:51.420> actually<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.500> course<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
they actually are and then of course the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.560 
they actually are and then of course the
magma<00:01:53.310> cubes<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.360> what

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
magma cubes I don't really know what

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
magma cubes I don't really know what
that<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:55.140> type<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> maybe<00:01:55.740> Promethean

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that is some type of maybe Promethean

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
that is some type of maybe Promethean
design<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.960> tell<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
design but I can tell you that the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
design but I can tell you that the
zombie<00:01:59.579> Pigman<00:02:00.030> definitely<00:02:00.509> looks<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.899> an

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
zombie Pigman definitely looks like an

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.020 
zombie Pigman definitely looks like an
elite<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.829> anyways<00:02:02.100> guys<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
elite so anyways guys that's what I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
elite so anyways guys that's what I

something<00:02:05.040> or<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.430> feel<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.729> maybe<00:02:05.909> some<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
something or you feel like maybe some of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
something or you feel like maybe some of
these<00:02:06.329> different<00:02:06.659> textures<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:07.920> new

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
these different textures for these new

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.219 
these different textures for these new
mobs<00:02:08.399> were<00:02:08.970> something<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> didn't<00:02:09.989> say

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
mobs were something that I didn't say

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
mobs were something that I didn't say

moving on we just have those other three
screenshots<00:02:15.440> depicting<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> few<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> skins

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
screenshots depicting a few of the skins

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
screenshots depicting a few of the skins
that<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.550> going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.300> well<00:02:18.930> as

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
that are going to be in there as well as

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.620 
that are going to be in there as well as
some<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> cool<00:02:19.830> block<00:02:20.490> textures<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.330> all

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
some of the cool block textures and all

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.910 
some of the cool block textures and all
that<00:02:21.780> kind<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.960> good<00:02:22.020> stuff<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.440> something

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
that kind of good stuff and something

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920 
that kind of good stuff and something
that<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.250> actually<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.600> grass

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
that I do actually like is the grass

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.250 
that I do actually like is the grass
texture<00:02:25.410> still<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.310> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.820> same<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.690> for

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
texture still is kind of the same so for

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.900 
texture still is kind of the same so for
survival<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:28.860> stuff<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.700> seems

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
survival and stuff like that it seems

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.090 
survival and stuff like that it seems
like<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.300> might<00:02:30.330> may<00:02:30.900> still<00:02:31.260> be<00:02:31.410> possible<00:02:31.920> so

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
like that might may still be possible so

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.310 
like that might may still be possible so
that's<00:02:32.280> pretty<00:02:32.490> cool<00:02:32.730> news<00:02:32.870> anyways<00:02:33.870> though<00:02:34.110> I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that's pretty cool news anyways though I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.080 
that's pretty cool news anyways though I
definitely<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.070> 4j<00:02:35.460> Studios<00:02:35.820> did<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
definitely think that 4j Studios did a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.450 
definitely think that 4j Studios did a
really<00:02:36.450> good<00:02:36.630> job<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.320> mash-up<00:02:37.950> pack<00:02:38.190> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
really good job on this mash-up pack I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.100 
really good job on this mash-up pack I
mean<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.060> third<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.840> have

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
mean this is a third one that we have

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.660 
mean this is a third one that we have
gotten<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.650> believe<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.220> had<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> Mass

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
gotten I do believe we had the Mass

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.310 
gotten I do believe we had the Mass
Effect<00:02:41.700> one<00:02:42.270> which<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.540> really<00:02:42.720> didn't<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.050> I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
Effect one which I really didn't like I

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.660 
Effect one which I really didn't like I
let<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.530> guys<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.490> then<00:02:44.580> of

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
let you guys know that and then of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.640 
let you guys know that and then of
course<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:45.090> had<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.330> Skyrim<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:45.990> which<00:02:46.470> was

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
course we had the Skyrim one which was

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.440 
course we had the Skyrim one which was
actually<00:02:47.040> pretty<00:02:47.220> cool<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.790> did<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.210> that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
actually pretty cool and I did like that

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.810 
actually pretty cool and I did like that
one<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.500> was<00:02:49.590> more<00:02:49.800> medieval<00:02:50.190> ish<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
one but it was more medieval ish and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.580 
one but it was more medieval ish and
stuff<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.990> was<00:02:52.140> pretty<00:02:52.320> cool

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590

end<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.650> week<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> am<00:03:14.550> assuming<00:03:14.910> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
end of the week so I am assuming that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.910 
end of the week so I am assuming that
it's<00:03:15.840> probably<00:03:16.050> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.320> next<00:03:16.770> week

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
it's probably going to be next week

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.500 
it's probably going to be next week
before<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.340> actually<00:03:17.580> see<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.090> roll<00:03:18.330> out

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
before we actually see this roll out

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.360 
before we actually see this roll out
onto<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.989> marketplace<00:03:19.500> as<00:03:19.680> far<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
onto the marketplace as far as the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.190 
onto the marketplace as far as the
costcos<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.209> probably<00:03:21.420> expect<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.020> be

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
costcos we can probably expect it to be

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.370 
costcos we can probably expect it to be
a<00:03:22.380> dollar<00:03:22.800> 99<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.610> 299<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> other<00:03:24.900> master
