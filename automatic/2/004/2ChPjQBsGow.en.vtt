00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 use of matteo with a very interesting topic 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.480
 which is the have cars are high-end 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 but here it is much more expensive than in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.960
 europa in Europe which is where 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.639
 I produce I go to the concrete examples 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.949
 directly so as not to bore you with 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.500
 great considerations alfa romeo all 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 is the model giulietta 56 thousand 500 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.920
 dollars in Argentina almost a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 department in a modest neighborhood of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 capital and in Europe 38 thousand 600 dollars and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.040
 that if you differentiate 46 thousand 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.020
 46% forgiveness is to say that you buy 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.390
 the tax is for cars that go in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.129
 final value more or less between the 180 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 thousand pesos live by the question 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.270
 production there are no more taxes now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.969
 for high-end cars those that come out 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 between 180 thousand and 250 thousand pesos prices 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.680
 final approximately that that also 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.860
 they have become expensive but I am the difference 46 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
 percent let a car that is good 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.680
 characteristic of high-end the audi is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 a very high-end brand 2.0 61 thousand 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 dollars in argentina 52 thousand 500 almost in 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.120
 Europe here the difference is not so much 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 but 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.740
 it's a strong difference 18% we're going to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.960
 toyota here I think there is a 4x4 to see 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.360
 for families that there is like that a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.620
 land cruiser end if you are 135,000 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.780
 to 122 thousand dollars not now either 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.780
 for this money to buy a house 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.700
 Here is good that a ship does not not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.980
 reaches on board for everything 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.870
 has still on the roof but a 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.450
 4x4 car all respect all respect 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.730
 to friends is not a port is not a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.240
 mercedes is not a video is not the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.140
 very high is not a land rover this good 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.900
 what's it gonna be 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.690
 hyundai santa faith look at this 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.430
 difference to see 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.120
 if you want I tell you from another 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.380
 way this car comes out in europe what 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.780
 then be a car d 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.930
 from a lot less than a lot more 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.370
 benefits 45 thousand dollars 70 thousand 300 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.810
 impressive differences 58% the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.970
 automotive industry is an industry 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.650
 relatively protected around the world 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.390
 that also has to be said today 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.280
 Fortunately, Argentina is among the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.430
 20 most important producers at level 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.560
 of cars which is good but good at 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 sometimes you pay some prices what is 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.250
 actually argentina has given that 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.220
 logic that more cars 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.720
 cheap are relatively cheaper 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.760
 than in other parts of the world and the most 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.739
 expensive are relatively more expensive as 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.540
 was showing at this time and I had 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.630
 mercedes model of 76,400 here 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.599
 also the difference is 46% which is 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.620
 a very important plant 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.420
 the truth is that it is a consultation for 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.430
 light is a question perhaps where n of 12 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.910
 years you can not buy the car outside and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.769
 bring it by boat does not correspond to 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.769
 pay the price to nationalize it and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
 it ends up being bought 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.890
 and making the same purchase of it 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.469
 way that if for example we suppose that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.599
 had in a bordering country Chile and 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.909
 you bought a car there and what you are 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.879
 bring here you have to nationalize it 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.379
 you can ask for a clear permission very well the 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.030
 production I'm talking about the case 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.400
 Claudio Borghi 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.159
 when he lived in chile and works in chile 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 came to direct to mouth for less time 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.450
 that he started that he was going to direct 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.489
 then the permission for your 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.069
 Argentina circular car that you get 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.889
 permit for 90 days the customs gives you 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.840
 permission for 90 days after 90 days or 6 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.569
 another permit for three months or what 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.220
 nationalized the tree is good and not 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.980
 he thought as quality cast so soon 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.370
 he did not give but as he forgot to extend 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.169
 the permit that the customs or the one in 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.180
 definitive the simple ended 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.519
 kidnapping the car is that is another 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.799
 theme for example in chile you get 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.719
 cars at a very good price what happens that 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.030
 if I return that the argentina extracts you have 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.980
 have to ask for those two 90-day permits or 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.840
 you have to nationalize it there is a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.740
 exception that had not been I do not know if 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.440
 still in force 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.650
 and as it has to do with the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.840
 diplomats who are in the area 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.220
 they buy a car and they bring it here and I do not know 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.030
 if the regime is still there is a 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.550
 tax that was not paid yes and where not 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.020
 where cars pay less taxes is 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.430
 in the land of fire 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.460
 for example we remember that in land of 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.190
 fire is not paid VAT that is 21% what 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.570
 It happens that you can not buy fire 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.590
 and this is the transfer of a record of 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.930
 summer capital 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.210
 but they are not necessarily cheaper 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.370
 because on the island it's like they take advantage 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.500
 that this difference 21% of VAT that does not 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.080
 It is seen on the island as you say 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.460
 Patagonians to land of fire 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.010
 take advantage of that difference and place 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.210
 discount of 21% almost almost charge you what 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.970
 same as if you pay with VAT 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.560
 so what he means is the cars 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.660
 cheap cheapest from argentina 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.580
 difficult to get them and the expensive cars 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.150
 more expensive than Argentina is difficult 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.150
 get them
