00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890 

pentatonic<00:00:14.740> minor<00:00:14.980> scale<00:00:15.720> basically<00:00:16.720> what

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
pentatonic minor scale basically what

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.489 
pentatonic minor scale basically what
this<00:00:17.019> is<00:00:17.079> is<00:00:17.320> a<00:00:17.560> five<00:00:17.890> note<00:00:18.130> scale<00:00:19.230> we're<00:00:20.230> going

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:20.499 
this is is a five note scale we're going

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.849 
this is is a five note scale we're going
to<00:00:20.909> try<00:00:21.909> to<00:00:21.939> compare<00:00:22.449> this<00:00:22.689> to<00:00:23.019> the<00:00:23.050> natural

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
to try to compare this to the natural

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.399 
to try to compare this to the natural
minor<00:00:24.039> scale<00:00:24.189> of<00:00:24.519> a<00:00:24.579> previous<00:00:25.060> lesson<00:00:25.329> so<00:00:26.199> if

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:26.409 
minor scale of a previous lesson so if

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.159 
minor scale of a previous lesson so if
you<00:00:26.529> don't<00:00:26.739> know<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.449> maybe<00:00:28.449> go<00:00:28.659> back<00:00:28.869> and

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
you don't know that maybe go back and

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.929 
you don't know that maybe go back and
take<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.439> look<00:00:29.589> at<00:00:29.739> that<00:00:29.919> lesson<00:00:30.429> there<00:00:30.669> should

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
take a look at that lesson there should

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.410 
take a look at that lesson there should
be<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.060> link<00:00:31.269> on<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:31.539> page<00:00:31.599> somewhere<00:00:32.259> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
be a link on this page somewhere and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.930 
be a link on this page somewhere and
anyhow<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:36.640> we<00:00:36.760> do<00:00:36.970> is<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:39.100> two<00:00:39.430> notes<00:00:39.730> out

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
anyhow what we do is take two notes out

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.690 
anyhow what we do is take two notes out
of<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.330> natural<00:00:40.570> minor<00:00:41.080> scale<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.800> we<00:00:42.520> end

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
of that natural minor scale and we end

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.960 
of that natural minor scale and we end
up<00:00:42.880> with<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.150> pentatonic<00:00:43.660> minor<00:00:44.080> scale<00:00:44.970> so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
up with the pentatonic minor scale so

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.060 
up with the pentatonic minor scale so
starting<00:00:46.720> with<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.140> natural<00:00:47.440> minor<00:00:47.920> scale

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
starting with the natural minor scale

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.700 
starting with the natural minor scale
which<00:00:48.970> goes<00:00:49.180> like<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:55.780> remove<00:00:56.320> two

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
which goes like this will remove two

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.780 
which goes like this will remove two
notes<00:00:57.010> from<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.490> which<00:00:57.820> for<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.480> vino<00:00:59.790> EF

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
notes from that which for the vino EF

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.470 
notes from that which for the vino EF
note

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
note

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.460 
note
and<00:01:04.150> those<00:01:05.150> are<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.950> 2nd<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.190> 6th<00:01:07.940> note<00:01:11.440> be<00:01:12.440> a

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
and those are the 2nd and 6th note be a

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.160 
and those are the 2nd and 6th note be a
natural<00:01:12.800> minor<00:01:13.280> scale<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:14.000> know<00:01:14.659> what<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:14.960> wind

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
natural minor scale I know what we wind

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.820 
natural minor scale I know what we wind
up<00:01:15.409> with<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.340> five<00:01:16.700> note<00:01:16.940> scale<00:01:17.500> two<00:01:18.500> notes

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
up with is a five note scale two notes

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.740 
up with is a five note scale two notes
per<00:01:19.100> string<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.210> goes<00:01:20.330> something<00:01:20.540> like

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
per string and it goes something like

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.470 
per string and it goes something like
this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.460
