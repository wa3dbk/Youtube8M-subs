00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that sense it slightly overrated but

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.369

the cast and the cast was something that

bringing in this time John Goodman who I
love<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.159> he's<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> great<00:01:56.670> comedic<00:01:56.969> actor

he's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.780> great<00:01:57.960> dramatic<00:01:58.110> actor<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:58.829> he

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
he's a great dramatic actor when he

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.069 
he's a great dramatic actor when he
needs<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.310> dramatic<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.960> he's

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
needs to be dramatic so I think he's

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.600

used in the first two movies and after

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.229 
used in the first two movies and after
watching<00:02:29.099> his<00:02:29.400> trailer<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.760> still<00:02:30.090> don't

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
watching his trailer I still don't

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.270 
watching his trailer I still don't
really<00:02:30.390> know<00:02:30.480> what<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.810> movies<00:02:31.140> about<00:02:31.280> which

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
really know what this movies about which

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.979 
really know what this movies about which
is<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.430> good<00:02:32.640> thing<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:33.000> sometimes<00:02:33.540> comedy

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
is a good thing because sometimes comedy

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.860 
is a good thing because sometimes comedy
movie<00:02:34.260> trailers<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.069> comedies<00:02:35.629> tend<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.720> give

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
movie trailers for comedies tend to give

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.089 
movie trailers for comedies tend to give
away<00:02:36.959> pretty<00:02:37.319> much<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> whole<00:02:37.590> plot<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
away pretty much the whole plot of the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.589 
away pretty much the whole plot of the
movie<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.879> like<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> they're<00:02:39.390> still

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
movie but I like that they're still

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.509 
movie but I like that they're still
keeping<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.230> under<00:02:40.470> wraps<00:02:40.620> even<00:02:41.129> after<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
keeping this under wraps even after the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.150 
keeping this under wraps even after the
trailer<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.049> will<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.560> interesting<00:02:43.980> seeing

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
trailer so I will be interesting seeing

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
trailer so I will be interesting seeing
this<00:02:44.340> movie<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.910> seeing<00:02:45.180> what<00:02:45.299> kind<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.510> turn

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
this movie and seeing what kind of turn

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.660 
this movie and seeing what kind of turn
it<00:02:45.840> takes<00:02:46.049> having<00:02:46.890> said<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.130> there's<00:02:47.549> still

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
it takes having said that there's still

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250 
it takes having said that there's still
a<00:02:47.790> lot<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.000> things<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.540> really<00:02:48.810> did<00:02:49.110> not

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
a lot of things that I really did not

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
a lot of things that I really did not
like<00:02:49.319> about<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.860> trailer<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.729 
like about this trailer and one of the
main<00:02:51.180> things<00:02:51.450> was<00:02:51.599> actually<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> humor<00:02:52.440> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
know I did not even chuckle once during

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.900 
know I did not even chuckle once during
this<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.200> trailer<00:02:55.709> granted<00:02:56.579> there<00:02:56.700> weren't

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
not even seem like the kind of humor

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.069 
not even seem like the kind of humor
that<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.079> hangover<00:04:01.500> movies<00:04:01.980> usually<00:04:02.160> go<00:04:02.489> for

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
that the hangover movies usually go for

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.599 
that the hangover movies usually go for
it<00:04:04.079> just<00:04:04.230> seemed<00:04:04.440> very<00:04:04.650> childish<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.400> kind<00:04:05.549> of

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
it just seemed very childish and kind of

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.759 
it just seemed very childish and kind of
stupid<00:04:05.970> too<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.389> also<00:04:07.019> judging<00:04:07.500> from<00:04:07.650> his

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
stupid too and also judging from his

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.830 
stupid too and also judging from his
trailer<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.220> looks<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.579> ken<00:04:09.090> Jeong<00:04:09.389> has<00:04:09.810> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
trailer it looks like ken Jeong has a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.930 
trailer it looks like ken Jeong has a
big<00:04:10.139> role<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.470> movie<00:04:10.620> again<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.639> really

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
big role in the movie again and I really

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.339 
big role in the movie again and I really
like<00:04:12.120> King<00:04:12.329> John<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.569> think<00:04:12.840> he's<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.049> funny

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
like King John I think he's really funny

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.430 
like King John I think he's really funny
especially<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.130> show<00:04:14.280> community<00:04:14.489> but

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
especially on the show community but

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.020 
especially on the show community but
aside<00:04:16.440> from<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.799> first<00:04:17.039> hangover<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.729> really

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
aside from the first hangover I really

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.029 
aside from the first hangover I really
did<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:18.329> see<00:04:18.510> him<00:04:19.049> serving<00:04:19.320> any<00:04:19.560> purpose<00:04:19.620> in

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
did not see him serving any purpose in

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.800 
did not see him serving any purpose in
the<00:04:20.130> second<00:04:20.489> one<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:21.269> really<00:04:21.450> does<00:04:21.659> not

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the second one and it really does not

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.390 
the second one and it really does not
look<00:04:21.959> like<00:04:22.019> he<00:04:22.140> serves<00:04:22.440> much<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.979> purpose<00:04:23.280> in

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
look like he serves much of a purpose in

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.100 
look like he serves much of a purpose in
this<00:04:23.520> one<00:04:23.700> either<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.419> guess<00:04:24.659> we'll<00:04:24.930> see

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
this one either so I guess we'll see

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.870 
this one either so I guess we'll see
what<00:04:25.289> what<00:04:25.530> happens<00:04:25.860> with<00:04:25.979> his<00:04:26.099> character<00:04:26.460> but

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
what what happens with his character but

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.140 
what what happens with his character but
over

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
over

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.790 
over
all<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.300> was<00:04:27.540> not<00:04:27.690> entirely<00:04:28.050> impressed<00:04:28.590> with

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
all I was not entirely impressed with

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.310 
all I was not entirely impressed with
the<00:04:28.919> trailer<00:04:29.190> for<00:04:29.430> The<00:04:29.490> Hangover<00:04:29.639> Part<00:04:29.880> 3<00:04:30.360> to
