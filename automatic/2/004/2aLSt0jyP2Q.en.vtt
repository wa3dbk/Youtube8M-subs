00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.180
 these girl dinners so I'm fine 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.900
 power today to make you a 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.269
 small 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.629
 seen on a command actually that jeanne 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.520
 to receive just today so it's up to 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.200
 about nails I already put a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 photo in fact on my facebook 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.619
 it's called art formulas so I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 think that's how it says 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.460
 do not be sure no by votes 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.460
 That's what happens 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.200
 so that's actually something 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.330
 that I had already seen on some videos 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 youtube it was often American 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.530
 in fact who is who finally made it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 that they hear rather I know that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.060
 strawberry pie she also made 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.010
 so I actually wanted to test 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.130
 to see to make my own opinion 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 and to see what it gave no because 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.160
 I will explain a little bit of everything 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.980
 how badly things are going 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.960
 heirs whose snow tears 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.950
 light 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.790
 that's the name I hope we 'll see 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.920
 so the place is actually that's how 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.180
 this is 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 I will show you the one I use 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.190
 and just today, it's down 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 present in little tubes like that 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.030
 do not we do you have paper that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.480
 is called leaves actually this deceased 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.490
 like that 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.470
 and so in fact it's a bit like 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.620
 decalco manic you put on your nails 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.330
 so with the help of a special glue you 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.420
 do not put on your nail and in front of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.980
 canes only on the nail so that's it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.250
 how is it not the little ones 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.440
 tubes like that you have a meter 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.030
 fifty of band 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.340
 So it can be scary but even 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.660
 no need for a lot of wallpapers 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.820
 if you have short nails like 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.230
 links you do not need a lot 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.230
 and there is really a lot of 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.430
 choice of tubes in any case on the site 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.080
 there are many say they offer 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.380
 but that one I thought was the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.610
 better then so a little tube like that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.110
 therefore 1 meter 50 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.390
 it costs pounds so that happily 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.340
 really cheap at all 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.110
 on the site his cup of books I have 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.460
 took 2.9 well I wanted to show a little 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.360
 like that you'll see the patterns that 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.130
 I have and I have taken so as pau tube 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.250
 glue like this suffers from the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.690
 really special glue for that so I 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.150
 paid you after started how 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.770
 how does it work and so there 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.630
 still there the expensive if I believe 2 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.680
 I have more than one for me and 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.829
 for my sister like that to attest 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.689
 I showed you the tubes that I have 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.510
 so here is the tube that I have so I 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:46.920
 a flashy rose a rose the lights on 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.700
 can violate a silver violin a little 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.130
 mirror effect a silver black a 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.860
 champagne then the cie 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.500
 indeed a little cracked golden and blue 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.530
 clear blue turquoise 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.900
 this one has a little bit of everything flowers 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.970
 really brilliant sent it shines 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.720
 that's how it's called tea and dye 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.990
 on price any gilles the camouflage so 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.720
 I now put that in fact 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.950
 it's simple enough to make simple but 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.680
 both complicated actually I'm going to you 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.110
 explain even first of all actually on 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.240
 your have to apply another 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.220
 completely simple reverse varnish from 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.040
 any brand that is getting closer 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.810
 some aunt tubes you 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.420
 want but finally from the end you 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.970
 so use me I used the fuck 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.490
 camouflage of the coup I used so my 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.710
 khaki varnish from h &amp; m 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.360
 you could take a dark brown I 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.980
 think with a moment and he would have 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.450
 emerged a little more intense 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.710
 next time I will try because 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.200
 that with this one I have the impression that 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.990
 it's a little less dense at the top 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.480
 all that serves because when you 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.910
 go put the salad leaf is 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.440
 patterned on your nails everything is wrong 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.270
 it's done very well so in fact 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.590
 we'll see a little bit under your nail 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.370
 so it's better to have a polish that 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.739
 is getting closer 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.230
 tent of the leaf I hope you 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.659
 will understand then so you put 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.519
 firstly your layer of varnish while 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.260
 that it dries 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.970
 then you put a layer of this 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.859
 glue so that looks like this 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.669
 like a varnish simply very 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.530
 liquid so you put a layer 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.850
 on your nail was expecting of saint 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.400
 So siege at first it's a little is 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.560
 white like a tube and once it 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.900
 was completely transparent so I 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.510
 you cut a little bit a little 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.750
 square of the shape of your fingernail in the 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.150
 paper you simply ask 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.910
 your shadow is actually after so with 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.860
 the nail or so with a small 1 small 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.199
 bamboo sticks it's a lot more 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.060
 practical and well you just stick like 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.130
 that really good you rub on it 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.130
 to stop layers then you 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.080
 remove and that makes you that result and 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.580
 then after you put a little bit of top 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.620
 coat something like this to make 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.789
 watch out because I saw that it did not 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.639
 not done but apparently with the top 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.490
 coat it spoils the paper a little 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.419
 decalcos but love I think it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.840
 rende is not bad 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.270
 so it's not mini that she leaves on 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.319
 could see it if you go to see him I 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.360
 do not know if you're going to see it but at 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:23.499
 places where it's really not great 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:25.379
 it was my first so here we will see 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.460
 good for next time 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.159
 in any case I still very 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.919
 happy because it will not be expensive 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.659
 when or when I have nine small tubes 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.699
 like that so 1 meter 50 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.279
 it's still huge me I took 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.900
 9 knowing that I split them in half 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:45.340
 legs that my sister like that we'll have them 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.800
 hands so for the nine and for two 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.020
 white varnish like that finally not the 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.400
 school verdict excuse me I got 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.250
 for 20 pounds linen even cheap in 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.949
 more of that really the big advantage over 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.220
 this site is that the shipping costs are 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.590
 free from 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.940
 open frankly we are waiting for them 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.080
 still quite easily because we 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.280
 want to take everything because it's 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.920
 so cheap that we want everything 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.450
 take and not free shipping 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.000
 it's still great so I think 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.790
 it's in England it's still 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.290
 delivered super fast in France under 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.510
 seduced me I ordered Wednesday 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.230
 last I received today so that's 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.060
 still really super fast so 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.060
 that's all game for the 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.470
 explanations I 'll just put you 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.330
 down one at a fake a few 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.610
 tutorials that I finally saw americans 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.660
 who did it I think it will be more 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.040
 clear because I have not yet 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.740
 really the technique today it's 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.360
 the first time I did so I 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.730
 do not think you still have the great advice 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.530
 so you propose surveyors in 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.060
 the info bar all the tutorials that I have 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.760
 view and so that it just makes you want 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.350
 to buy her leaves like that you 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.919
 will really see the explanations and all 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.930
 that and so here I think it will be 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.950
 everything if you have any questions 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.800
 do not hesitate to ask me 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.120
 comments or so on facebook so 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.220
 the one who are not following us yet on 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.160
 facebook is zero in dawn sisters 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.990
 video we are very much to be 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.700
 on facebook in general all the stuff 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.770
 that I never test first on facebook 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.710
 and then you do 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.629
 seen as today so here I hope 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.680
