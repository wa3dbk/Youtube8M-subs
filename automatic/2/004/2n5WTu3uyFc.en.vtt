00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
now we've got rather or a bit of wind I

don't know how much feels like about 20
the<00:00:32.160> good<00:00:32.309> thing<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.879> wind<00:00:33.000> blows<00:00:33.270> we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the good thing is when the wind blows we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.729 
the good thing is when the wind blows we
go<00:00:33.600> fast<00:00:35.600> again<00:00:36.629> getting<00:00:37.379> that<00:00:37.440> towards<00:00:37.769> 6:00

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
go fast again getting that towards 6:00

morning<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.540> way<00:01:21.689> wind<00:01:22.200> came<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.979> enough

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
morning the way wind came up just enough

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.860 
morning the way wind came up just enough
to<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.939> us<00:01:24.119> moving<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:26.509> at<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.750> 6:00<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> we

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
to get us moving and at about 6:00 so we

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.060 
to get us moving and at about 6:00 so we
got<00:01:31.050> moving<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.220 

like<00:01:36.070> put<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.430> main<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.330> working<00:01:37.780> jib<00:01:37.990> up

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
like put the main and the working jib up

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.460 
like put the main and the working jib up
and<00:01:38.530> we're<00:01:39.010> making<00:01:39.960> two<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.170> half<00:01:41.290> three

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and we're making two and a half three

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.120 
and we're making two and a half three
knots<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.130> then<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:43.660> weather<00:01:43.990> system<00:01:44.260> we

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
knots and then this weather system we

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.350 
knots and then this weather system we
could<00:01:45.280> see<00:01:45.460> coming<00:01:45.700> down<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.180> us<00:01:46.210> from

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
could see coming down on us from

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680 
could see coming down on us from
windward<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.880> just<00:01:48.940> watching<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:49.510> come

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
windward so I was just watching it come

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.590 
windward so I was just watching it come
and<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.170> we<00:01:50.920> had<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.070> bat<00:01:51.310> Laura<00:01:51.550> said<00:01:51.820> she<00:01:52.120> said

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
and I we had a bat Laura said she said

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.330 
and I we had a bat Laura said she said
it<00:01:52.690> would<00:01:52.840> miss<00:01:53.080> us<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.650> said<00:01:53.920> no<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.160> think

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
it would miss us and I said no I think

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.180 
it would miss us and I said no I think
I'm<00:01:54.550> gonna<00:01:54.640> get<00:01:54.790> into<00:01:54.970> my<00:01:55.030> fall<00:01:55.330> weather<00:01:55.510> gear

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
I'm gonna get into my fall weather gear

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.530 
I'm gonna get into my fall weather gear
and<00:01:57.960> sure<00:01:58.960> enough<00:01:59.670> we<00:02:00.670> got<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.180> got<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.330> few

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
and sure enough we got it we got a few

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
and sure enough we got it we got a few
minutes<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:03.000> healed<00:02:04.000> way<00:02:04.270> over<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.960> boiling

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
minutes of healed way over and boiling

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.040 
minutes of healed way over and boiling
along<00:02:06.030> wind<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.270> don't<00:02:07.450> know<00:02:07.510> I<00:02:07.540> didn't<00:02:07.900> measure

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
along wind I don't know I didn't measure

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.020 
along wind I don't know I didn't measure
it<00:02:08.290> so<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.500> don't<00:02:08.680> know<00:02:08.770> exactly<00:02:09.160> what<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.460> was<00:02:09.580> I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
it so I don't know exactly what it was I

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.030 
it so I don't know exactly what it was I
would<00:02:10.210> estimate<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.750> was<00:02:10.869> 25<00:02:11.350> knots<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:11.830> for

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
would estimate it was 25 knots there for

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.380 
would estimate it was 25 knots there for
a<00:02:12.070> minute<00:02:12.250> or<00:02:12.990> two<00:02:14.820> now<00:02:15.820> is<00:02:16.000> slowing<00:02:16.360> down

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
a minute or two now is slowing down

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.690 
a minute or two now is slowing down
again<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> think<00:02:17.050> it's<00:02:17.620> past<00:02:17.890> those<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.520> see

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
again I think it's past those I can see

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.300 
again I think it's past those I can see
the<00:02:18.820> wind<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.750> rain<00:02:19.960> now<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.620> off<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.980> lured

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
the wind the rain now is off the lured

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.810 
the wind the rain now is off the lured
and<00:02:24.090> still<00:02:25.090> raining<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> little<00:02:25.540> bit<00:02:26.820> yeah

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
and still raining a little bit yeah

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.150 
and still raining a little bit yeah
that's<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.270> little<00:02:28.420> bit<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.980> spitting<00:02:29.980> out

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
that's a little bit and spitting out

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.970 
that's a little bit and spitting out
over<00:02:30.520> there<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> windward<00:02:34.800> ahead<00:02:35.800> no<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.890> that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
over there to windward ahead no not that

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.570 
over there to windward ahead no not that
I<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.280> see

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

no<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:47.850> went<00:02:48.000> through<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.210> squall<00:02:48.570> that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
no we just went through a squall that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.370 
no we just went through a squall that
had<00:02:49.050> us<00:02:49.850> healed<00:02:50.850> over<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.270> good<00:02:51.510> 20<00:02:51.870> degrees<00:02:52.170> we

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
had us healed over a good 20 degrees we

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.350 
had us healed over a good 20 degrees we
have<00:02:52.410> probably<00:02:52.950> 25<00:02:53.430> knots<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.880> wind<00:02:53.910> at<00:02:54.210> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
have probably 25 knots of wind at the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.380 
have probably 25 knots of wind at the
peak<00:02:54.570> only<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.530> maybe<00:02:56.310> five<00:02:56.670> minutes<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.580> now

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
peak only for maybe five minutes and now

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.970 
peak only for maybe five minutes and now
