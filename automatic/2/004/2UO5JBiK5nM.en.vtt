00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 in pixar there are many theories based on the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.010
 main theory called the theory of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.740
 pixar in which a basically some 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.259
 pixar movies with others after the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.660
 premiere intensely we all got to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 think if it will be linked with any 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.119
 another movie of this company and we have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 seen that yes with the previous theories 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.740
 It should be noted before that there is another way of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 join them which are for things like 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.769
 this straight that is the last video about 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.230
 intensely that will come soon but there 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.870
 another more specific thing that links the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 intensely movie with the one of toy 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.090
 story and is the theory named railey 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.059
 intensely can be bonus bonnie 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.730
 of toy story to start both 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.129
 little ones are really different 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.170
 reilly she is a girl of 11 years 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 age that will reach 12 the end of the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.270
 movie that mick hocking frawley was 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.969
 uprooted from his happy life and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.129
 just in minnesota taking it 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.900
 towards francisco where is it going to 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.870
 experience various changes 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.570
 her life ivonne and is a 4 year old girl 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.430
 old she goes to the nursery sunnyside 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.160
 where she is the daughter of the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.040
 receptionist even though bonnie 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.360
 have an active imagination when 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.210
 play with his toys 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.070
 the theory was created when someone god 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.490
 with the last names of both characters 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.310
 they are equal lovers frander be but they 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.340
 they write different the bonnie's is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.580
 Anderson and the rail is andersen 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.740
 at the end we 'll talk about this detail as 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.869
 the reality is that the movie of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.729
 intensely has much in common 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.220
 certain things with the toy movie 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.100
 story 3 like the resemblance of reggae with 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.190
 Andy's mom among others have more 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.530
 the interests will see another clear bearing 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.290
 although it can be a relative of bonn and 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.440
 now with respect to their age 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.020
 clearly tells us that reilly is the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.330
 greater in intensely make a flashback 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.930
 when he was born 11 years ago 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.240
 probably in 2004 and history 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.630
 it occurs when she is 12 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.960
 in the year 2015 with respect to goni she 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.910
 we can calculate between 4 and 5 since 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.640
 that's the average age to go to a 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.600
 daycare but that was in the year 2010 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.690
 for the year 2015 and to have between 10 o 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.750
 9 years is to say that Israel is greater by 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.730
 3 or 2 years old but the relationship 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.190
 between the two we already know that it is the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.070
 surname but because the vowel change 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.190
 ok this is basically given by the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.860
 created from that movie and in this one is 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.410
 one of the creators of toy story and for 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.260
 not making it so obvious is this change 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.440
 of vowel in the surname of rail and although 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.450
 sound almost identical but the truth is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 that we only hope that if he gives us another 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.880
 track about this in the new 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.070
 film that comes from toy story 4 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.400
 We give away the law to encourage and 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.470
