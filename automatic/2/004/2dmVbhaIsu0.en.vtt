ahead<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:07.879> get<00:03:08.060> marksmanship<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:13.129> far<00:03:13.370> as

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
ahead and get marksmanship so as far as

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
ahead and get marksmanship so as far as
traps<00:03:14.349> for<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:15.470> first<00:03:15.769> wave<00:03:16.010> here<00:03:16.450> first

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
traps for this first wave here first

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.020 
traps for this first wave here first
thing<00:03:17.540> we're<00:03:17.659> gonna<00:03:17.750> do<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:17.959> set<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> fire<00:03:18.560> wall

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
thing we're gonna do is set a fire wall

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.220 
thing we're gonna do is set a fire wall
right<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.060> seems<00:03:20.540> like<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> best<00:03:20.959> place<00:03:21.079> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
right here seems like the best place to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.569 
right here seems like the best place to
set<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.650> because<00:03:21.799> then<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.040> only<00:03:22.129> takes<00:03:22.430> up

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
set it because then it only takes up

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.059 
set it because then it only takes up
four<00:03:23.109> action<00:03:24.109> points<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.530> opposed<00:03:24.829> to<00:03:24.889> putting

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
four action points as opposed to putting

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.229 
four action points as opposed to putting
it<00:03:25.220> here<00:03:25.549> or<00:03:25.909> here<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:29.000> are<00:03:29.030> gonna

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
it here or here and then we are gonna

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.339 
it here or here and then we are gonna
also<00:03:29.629> put<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:30.049> spike<00:03:30.409> trap<00:03:31.840> I'm<00:03:32.840> gonna<00:03:33.109> actually

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
also put a spike trap I'm gonna actually

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.649 
also put a spike trap I'm gonna actually
do<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.739> up<00:03:34.040> here<00:03:35.920> should<00:03:36.920> let<00:03:37.159> me<00:03:37.310> hear<00:03:38.090> about

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
do it up here should let me hear about

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.379 
do it up here should let me hear about
right<00:03:39.049> there<00:03:39.639> so<00:03:40.639> we're<00:03:40.760> gonna<00:03:40.849> go<00:03:41.030> ahead<00:03:41.180> and

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
right there so we're gonna go ahead and

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.270 
right there so we're gonna go ahead and
put<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:41.989> spike<00:03:42.319> trap<00:03:42.560> right<00:03:42.799> there

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
put that spike trap right there

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.150 
put that spike trap right there
and<00:03:43.760> what<00:03:44.599> we're<00:03:44.690> gonna<00:03:44.810> do<00:03:45.079> basically<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.829> run

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
and what we're gonna do basically is run

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.280 
and what we're gonna do basically is run
up<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:46.930> lure<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.260> guy<00:03:49.599> run<00:03:50.599> this<00:03:50.780> way<00:03:50.959> drink

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
up here lure this guy run this way drink

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.030 
up here lure this guy run this way drink
our<00:03:51.410> damage<00:03:51.739> potion<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.709> because<00:03:54.709> we're<00:03:54.889> weak

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
our damage potion and because we're weak

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.220 
our damage potion and because we're weak
against<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.760> Mike<00:03:56.000> hands<00:03:56.239> with<00:03:56.510> our<00:03:56.540> blessed

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
against the Mike hands with our blessed

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.439 
against the Mike hands with our blessed
weapon<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.739> then<00:03:58.549> we're<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.120> yell<00:03:59.419> on

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
weapon and then we're going to yell on

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.839 
weapon and then we're going to yell on
top<00:03:59.870> of<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.169> so<00:04:00.650> these<00:04:00.859> guys<00:04:01.069> will<00:04:01.340> run<00:04:01.579> and

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
top of this so these guys will run and

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.089 
top of this so these guys will run and
hopefully<00:04:02.060> impale<00:04:02.599> them<00:04:02.780> all<00:04:02.959> but<00:04:03.799> most

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
hopefully impale them all but most

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.589 
hopefully impale them all but most
likely<00:04:04.430> we'll<00:04:04.549> have<00:04:04.669> to<00:04:04.790> mop<00:04:04.970> up<00:04:05.000> one<00:04:05.449> or<00:04:05.569> two

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
likely we'll have to mop up one or two

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.650 
likely we'll have to mop up one or two
of<00:04:05.870> them<00:04:05.989> on<00:04:06.280> wave<00:04:07.280> two<00:04:07.669> we<00:04:08.239> are<00:04:08.329> going<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.569> go

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
of them on wave two we are going to go

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.439 
of them on wave two we are going to go
ahead<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.169> put<00:04:09.530> another<00:04:09.739> spike<00:04:10.340> trap<00:04:10.639> about

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
ahead and put another spike trap about

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.640 
ahead and put another spike trap about
right<00:04:12.459> here<00:04:14.169> there<00:04:15.169> we<00:04:15.290> go

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
right here there we go

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.039 
right here there we go
and<00:04:16.039> the<00:04:16.880> reason<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.209> do<00:04:17.269> is<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:17.539> close<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.810> where

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
and the reason I do is so close to where

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.390 
and the reason I do is so close to where
they<00:04:18.139> spawn<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.889> have<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.070> better<00:04:19.310> chance

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
they spawn is you have a better chance

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.279 
they spawn is you have a better chance
of<00:04:19.729> getting<00:04:19.880> all<00:04:20.090> four<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.449> them<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:20.810> there<00:04:20.989> and

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
of getting all four of them in there and

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.260 
of getting all four of them in there and
then<00:04:22.190> we<00:04:22.280> also<00:04:22.430> have<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.849> two<00:04:23.000> grand

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
then we also have the two grand

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.029 
then we also have the two grand
werewolves<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.139> regular<00:04:24.530> werewolves

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
werewolves and the to regular werewolves

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.640 
werewolves and the to regular werewolves
so<00:04:25.610> I'm<00:04:25.760> going<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.479> go<00:04:26.630> ahead<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.199> put<00:04:27.380> another

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
so I'm going to go ahead and put another

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.900 
so I'm going to go ahead and put another
spike<00:04:27.949> trap<00:04:28.449> right<00:04:29.449> in<00:04:30.190> here<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:31.340> scarecrow

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
spike trap right in here but scarecrow

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.880 
spike trap right in here but scarecrow
right<00:04:34.910> there<00:04:35.120> works<00:04:35.330> out<00:04:35.540> fine<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.110> now<00:04:36.830> we

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
right there works out fine and now we

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.130 
right there works out fine and now we
can<00:04:37.220> lure<00:04:37.370> them<00:04:37.580> all<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:38.030> their<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.480> I'm<00:04:38.930> also

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
can lure them all to their and I'm also

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.660 
can lure them all to their and I'm also
going<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.440> go<00:04:39.590> ahead<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.010> put<00:04:40.220> an<00:04:40.340> explosive

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
going to go ahead and put an explosive

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.850 
going to go ahead and put an explosive
barrel<00:04:41.210> just<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.170> help<00:04:42.320> us<00:04:42.470> out<00:04:42.560> with<00:04:42.680> those

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
barrel just to help us out with those

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.400 
barrel just to help us out with those
grand<00:04:43.190> werewolves<00:04:43.850> if<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.900> spike<00:04:45.170> trap

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
grand werewolves if this spike trap

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.730 
grand werewolves if this spike trap
doesn't<00:04:45.770> kill<00:04:45.920> them<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:47.810> won't<00:04:48.110> kill<00:04:48.410> them

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
doesn't kill them and it won't kill them

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.950 
doesn't kill them and it won't kill them
it'll<00:04:48.980> just<00:04:49.160> soft<00:04:49.400> them<00:04:49.580> up<00:04:49.700> but<00:04:49.940> if<00:04:50.270> it

basically if we can't kill them let's go

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.200 
basically if we can't kill them let's go
ahead<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.300> chop<00:04:56.960> down<00:04:57.440> our<00:04:57.830> trees<00:04:58.220> that's
