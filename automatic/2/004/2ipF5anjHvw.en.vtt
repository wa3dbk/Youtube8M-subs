limited<00:00:13.650> facelift<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> true

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
limited facelift it's a it's a true

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.710 
limited facelift it's a it's a true
facelift<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.340> mostly<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> office

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
facelift that we do mostly in the office

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.380 
facelift that we do mostly in the office
requires<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.859> local<00:00:20.220> anesthetic<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
requires a local anesthetic and it's a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.529 
requires a local anesthetic and it's a
relatively<00:00:22.350> short<00:00:22.560> recovery<00:00:23.130> which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> great

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
relatively short recovery which is great

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.330 
relatively short recovery which is great
because<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.080> traditional<00:00:25.710> facelift<00:00:26.039> would

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
because a traditional facelift would

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.099 
because a traditional facelift would
take<00:00:26.550> how<00:00:26.880> long<00:00:26.939> usually<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.810> someone<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
take how long usually for someone to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.490 
take how long usually for someone to
recover<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:29.029> about<00:00:30.029> four<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> six<00:00:30.570> weeks<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
recover from about four to six weeks and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.560 
recover from about four to six weeks and
usually<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.340> i<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.610> say<00:00:32.820> probably<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
usually here i would say probably two to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290 
usually here i would say probably two to
three<00:00:33.600> days<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> huge<00:00:35.969> difference

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
three days that was a huge difference

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.380 
three days that was a huge difference
right<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> HD<00:00:37.770> offense<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.000> what

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
right there it is HD offense so what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020 
right there it is HD offense so what
makes<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.050> procedure<00:00:40.500> unique<00:00:41.280> besides<00:00:41.730> just

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
makes this procedure unique besides just

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.209 
makes this procedure unique besides just
recovery<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.040> particular

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
recovery time I think this particular

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
recovery time I think this particular
procedure<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.600> rejuvenate<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
procedure it's really rejuvenate the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.450 
procedure it's really rejuvenate the
youthful<00:00:47.039> appearance<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.850> people<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.129> what

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
youthful appearance for people and what

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.410 
youthful appearance for people and what
it<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.270> downtime<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:53.309> lists<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.120> far

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it is it's no downtime a it lists as far

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.369 
it is it's no downtime a it lists as far
as<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> outcome<00:00:55.140> probably<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.460> 810<00:00:57.270> years

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
as the outcome probably it's 810 years

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.599 
as the outcome probably it's 810 years
so<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.680> gives<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> same<00:00:59.460> effect

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so it really gives you the same effect

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.479 
so it really gives you the same effect
that<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.449> traditional<00:01:00.750> facelift<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.949> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that the traditional facelift and it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.070 
that the traditional facelift and it's
being<00:01:02.699> done<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> office<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> local

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
being done in the office on the local

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
being done in the office on the local
anesthetic<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.460> think<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> outcome<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
anesthetic and I think the outcome is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
anesthetic and I think the outcome is
excellent<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.140> something<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> dr.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
excellent and it's something that dr.

straightens the jawline and we'll

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.670 
straightens the jawline and we'll
tighten<00:01:40.760> up<00:01:40.850> small<00:01:41.690> amounts<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.230> loose<00:01:42.530> skin
