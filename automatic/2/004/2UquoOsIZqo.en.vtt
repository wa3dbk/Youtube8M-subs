00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
and I just sprained a little bit on top

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.580 
and I just sprained a little bit on top
of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.209> hair<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.569> kind<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.959> did<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.170> this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
of the hair and kind of did like this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.920 
of the hair and kind of did like this
maybe<00:02:25.189> like<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.640> second<00:02:26.120> day<00:02:26.269> that<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.569> put<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
maybe like the second day that I put the

maybe like the second day that I put the
hair<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.409> but<00:02:28.250> other<00:02:28.489> than<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.970> haven't

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510

hair in but other than that I haven't
done<00:02:29.900> anything<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.470> my<00:02:30.739> hair<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:32.209> for<00:02:32.750> my

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
done anything to my hair and then for my

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.280 
done anything to my hair and then for my
hair<00:02:33.260> underneath<00:02:33.819> what<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.849> did<00:02:35.360> last<00:02:35.900> night

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
hair underneath what I did last night

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.399 
hair underneath what I did last night
for<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.769> first<00:02:36.799> time<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.310> used<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:38.409> water

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
for the first time I used a water

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.729 
for the first time I used a water
mixture<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.730> my<00:02:41.599> care<00:02:41.959> free<00:02:42.230> curl<00:02:42.260> um<00:02:43.420> and

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
mixture with my care free curl um and

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.580 
mixture with my care free curl um and
peppermint<00:02:45.739> oil<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.299> shipped<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.019> up<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
peppermint oil and I shipped that up and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.149 
peppermint oil and I shipped that up and
then<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.890> went<00:02:49.129> through<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:50.180> doing<00:02:50.930> my

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
then I went through as I was doing my

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.240 
then I went through as I was doing my
sections<00:02:52.159> I<00:02:52.489> went<00:02:53.120> through<00:02:53.329> each<00:02:53.889> braid<00:02:54.889> and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
sections I went through each braid and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.619 
sections I went through each braid and
sprayed<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.299> my<00:02:56.359> scalp<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:58.450> that's<00:02:59.450> what

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
sprayed it on my scalp so that's what

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.920 
sprayed it on my scalp so that's what
I'm<00:02:59.720> going<00:02:59.900> to<00:02:59.959> do<00:03:00.139> this<00:03:00.349> going<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.129> as<00:03:01.280> far<00:03:01.310> as

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I'm going to do this going on as far as

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.539 
I'm going to do this going on as far as
moisturizing<00:03:02.930> my<00:03:03.049> hair<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:04.069> see<00:03:04.340> how<00:03:04.489> that

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
moisturizing my hair and see how that

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.309 
moisturizing my hair and see how that
goes<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:06.670> then<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:08.120> for<00:03:08.480> as<00:03:08.780> far<00:03:08.989> as<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
goes and then as for as far as the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.349 
goes and then as for as far as the
braiding<00:03:09.769> pattern<00:03:10.159> that<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.370> use<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.940> use<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
braiding pattern that I use I use the

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.509 
braiding pattern that I use I use the
similar<00:03:11.629> one<00:03:11.989> from<00:03:12.319> last<00:03:12.530> time<00:03:12.889> i<00:03:12.950> did<00:03:13.190> the

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
similar one from last time i did the

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.449 
similar one from last time i did the
whole<00:03:13.549> zigzag<00:03:14.359> method<00:03:14.900> in<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.139> back<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.680> then

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
whole zigzag method in the back and then

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.490 
whole zigzag method in the back and then
i<00:03:16.970> just<00:03:17.450> did<00:03:17.859> cornrows<00:03:19.810> going<00:03:20.810> all<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.379> way

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
i just did cornrows going all the way

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.009 
i just did cornrows going all the way
back<00:03:22.239> until<00:03:23.239> about<00:03:24.139> right<00:03:24.500> here<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.870> then<00:03:26.870> i

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
back until about right here and then i

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.520 
back until about right here and then i
did<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.530> exact<00:03:28.069> method<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:29.180> i<00:03:30.019> like<00:03:30.319> that

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
did this exact method and i like that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.250 
did this exact method and i like that
method<00:03:30.980> better<00:03:31.160> than<00:03:31.660> what<00:03:32.660> i<00:03:32.690> was<00:03:32.959> doing

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
method better than what i was doing

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.319 
method better than what i was doing
before<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.040> think<00:03:34.190> I'm<00:03:34.489> gonna<00:03:34.819> stick<00:03:35.269> with

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
before so I think I'm gonna stick with

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.059 
before so I think I'm gonna stick with
that<00:03:35.680> just<00:03:36.680> easier<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.639> breathe<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.889> guess<00:03:39.889> I

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
that just easier to breathe I guess I

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.280 
that just easier to breathe I guess I
kind<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.430> did<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:40.819> similar<00:03:41.480> method<00:03:41.900> but<00:03:42.019> then

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
kind of did that similar method but then

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.750 
kind of did that similar method but then
I<00:03:42.730> had<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:44.030> know<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.389> small<00:03:45.730> cornrows<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
I had you know the small cornrows and

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.839 
I had you know the small cornrows and
that's<00:03:47.269> what's<00:03:47.569> it<00:03:47.810> long<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:48.500> i<00:03:48.769> guess<00:03:49.340> this

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
that's what's it long so i guess this

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.300 
that's what's it long so i guess this
method<00:03:50.389> that<00:03:50.810> i<00:03:50.870> had<00:03:51.169> one<00:03:51.410> now<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:52.489> faster<00:03:54.310> but

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
method that i had one now is faster but

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.729 
method that i had one now is faster but
it<00:03:55.489> still<00:03:55.730> took<00:03:55.940> me<00:03:56.150> forever<00:03:56.449> to<00:03:56.840> do<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.260> Sonia

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
it still took me forever to do to Sonia

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.460 
it still took me forever to do to Sonia
so<00:03:58.010> that's<00:03:58.489> just<00:03:58.579> something<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.470> work

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
so that's just something I have to work

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.390 
so that's just something I have to work
on<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.980> get<00:04:01.159> better<00:04:01.400> at<00:04:01.699> but<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:03.400> definitely

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
on and get better at but I definitely

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.729 
on and get better at but I definitely
like<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.599> in<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:09.049> I'm<00:04:09.290> just<00:04:09.500> going<00:04:09.680> to

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
like the so in so I'm just going to

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.430 
like the so in so I'm just going to
check<00:04:10.129> these<00:04:10.400> out

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.800 

and<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.920> felt<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.459> did<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.940> because<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.420> felt<00:04:18.690> my

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and I felt I did this because I felt my

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.780 
and I felt I did this because I felt my
hair<00:04:19.049> getting<00:04:19.320> mad<00:04:19.620> at<00:04:19.859> why<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.070> went<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.670> the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
hair getting mad at why I went to the

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.750 
hair getting mad at why I went to the
beach<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.180> weekend<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:23.070> didn't

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
beach this weekend and I really didn't

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760 
beach this weekend and I really didn't
do<00:04:23.850> my<00:04:24.060> hair<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.390> just<00:04:24.810> kept<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.650> her

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
do my hair I just kept it in her

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.640 
do my hair I just kept it in her
hometown<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.540> didn't<00:04:27.930> comb<00:04:28.200> through<00:04:28.620> it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
hometown so I didn't comb through it

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.420 
hometown so I didn't comb through it
every<00:04:28.980> day<00:04:29.210> um<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:31.530> that's<00:04:31.800> probably<00:04:32.100> why<00:04:32.400> I

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
every day um so that's probably why I

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.920 
every day um so that's probably why I
got<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:33.030> mad<00:04:33.330> at<00:04:33.540> but<00:04:34.820> i'm<00:04:35.820> going<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.390> do

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
got a little mad at but i'm going to do

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.310 
got a little mad at but i'm going to do
better<00:04:37.260> with<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.770> from<00:04:38.280> here<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.669> out<00:04:39.140> since<00:04:40.140> I

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
better with it from here on out since I

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.960 
better with it from here on out since I
you<00:04:40.770> know<00:04:40.890> took<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.280> time<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.700> comb<00:04:41.940> through

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
you know took the time to comb through

00:04:41.970 --> 00:05:30.450
