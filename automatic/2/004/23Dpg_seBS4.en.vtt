00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
project today we're getting on the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.730 
project today we're getting on the
machine<00:00:12.730> and<00:00:12.969> working<00:00:13.360> on<00:00:13.510> a<00:00:13.539> new<00:00:13.809> design<00:00:13.990> this

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
machine and working on a new design this

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.339 
machine and working on a new design this
is<00:00:14.889> called<00:00:15.099> underwater<00:00:15.849> rocks<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.900> it's

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
is called underwater rocks and it's

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.589 
is called underwater rocks and it's
basically<00:00:17.950> what<00:00:18.250> happens<00:00:18.669> to<00:00:18.849> pebble<00:00:19.240> Aang

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
basically what happens to pebble Aang

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.319 
basically what happens to pebble Aang
when<00:00:19.810> you<00:00:19.930> stitch<00:00:20.200> it<00:00:20.410> really<00:00:21.070> messy<00:00:21.460> I'm<00:00:22.029> just

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
when you stitch it really messy I'm just

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.179 
when you stitch it really messy I'm just
gonna<00:00:22.419> let<00:00:22.750> my<00:00:22.779> lines<00:00:23.200> the<00:00:23.410> quilting<00:00:23.800> kind<00:00:24.099> of

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
gonna let my lines the quilting kind of

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.030 
gonna let my lines the quilting kind of
flow<00:00:24.669> over<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.119> piece<00:00:25.390> I'm<00:00:26.140> not<00:00:26.559> gonna<00:00:26.800> be

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
flow over the piece I'm not gonna be

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.339 
flow over the piece I'm not gonna be
real<00:00:27.399> picky<00:00:28.239> about<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.750> circles<00:00:29.140> being

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
real picky about the circles being

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.260 
real picky about the circles being
circular<00:00:29.919> I'm<00:00:30.130> not<00:00:30.399> going<00:00:30.579> to<00:00:30.640> be<00:00:30.730> real<00:00:30.970> picky

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
circular I'm not going to be real picky

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.180 
circular I'm not going to be real picky
about<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:34.020> travel<00:00:35.020> stitching<00:00:35.350> being<00:00:35.590> perfect

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
about the travel stitching being perfect

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.360 
about the travel stitching being perfect
I<00:00:36.520> actually<00:00:36.969> want<00:00:37.480> my<00:00:38.260> extra<00:00:38.859> lines<00:00:39.100> of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
I actually want my extra lines of

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.610 
I actually want my extra lines of
quilting<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.940> be<00:00:40.089> around<00:00:40.480> every<00:00:40.960> circle<00:00:41.410> and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
quilting to be around every circle and

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.290 
quilting to be around every circle and
the<00:00:41.710> reason<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.160> when<00:00:42.339> you<00:00:42.489> when<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.000> look<00:00:43.179> at

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
the reason is when you when you look at

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.209 
the reason is when you when you look at
rocks<00:00:43.570> underwater<00:00:44.050> like<00:00:44.260> photos<00:00:44.589> of<00:00:44.769> rocks

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
rocks underwater like photos of rocks

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.919 
rocks underwater like photos of rocks
underwater<00:00:45.579> they<00:00:45.969> seem<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.300> have<00:00:46.390> ripples

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
underwater they seem to have ripples

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.200 
underwater they seem to have ripples
around<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.920> edges<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:48.760> that's<00:00:48.940> what<00:00:49.120> I'm

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
around the edges and so that's what I'm

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.060 
around the edges and so that's what I'm
trying<00:00:49.539> to<00:00:49.629> capture<00:00:49.870> I'm<00:00:50.170> making<00:00:50.530> it<00:00:50.649> messy

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
trying to capture I'm making it messy

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.340 
trying to capture I'm making it messy
and<00:00:51.280> organic<00:00:51.909> and<00:00:52.120> that<00:00:52.149> seems<00:00:53.019> to<00:00:53.170> make<00:00:53.289> it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
and organic and that seems to make it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.739 
and organic and that seems to make it
look<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.710> little<00:00:53.920> bit<00:00:54.129> more<00:00:54.370> like<00:00:54.789> real<00:00:55.449> rocks

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
look a little bit more like real rocks

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.049 
look a little bit more like real rocks
so<00:00:56.199> let's<00:00:56.890> get<00:00:57.010> on<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.190> machine<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.640> see<00:00:57.879> how

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
so let's get on the machine and see how

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.430 
so let's get on the machine and see how
this<00:00:58.179> works<00:00:58.390> in<00:00:58.690> free<00:00:58.929> motion<00:01:01.019> okay<00:01:02.019> so<00:01:02.079> here

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
this works in free motion okay so here

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.500 
this works in free motion okay so here
we<00:01:02.589> go<00:01:02.769> I'm<00:01:03.010> gonna<00:01:03.159> stitch<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.609> fairly<00:01:04.239> big

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
we go I'm gonna stitch a fairly big

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.680 
we go I'm gonna stitch a fairly big
circle<00:01:04.960> but<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.320> have<00:01:05.650> an<00:01:05.920> inch<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.210> now<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.390> make

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
circle but I have an inch and now I make

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.480 
circle but I have an inch and now I make
it<00:01:07.840> an<00:01:07.960> underwater<00:01:08.380> right<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:08.920> more<00:01:09.370> or<00:01:09.460> less

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
it an underwater right it's more or less

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.610 
it an underwater right it's more or less
just<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.910> circle<00:01:10.300> I'm<00:01:10.450> going<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.780> kind<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.230> swing

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
just a circle I'm going to kind of swing

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:21.710 
just a circle I'm going to kind of swing
around<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.970> do<00:01:13.450> kind<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.930> messy<00:01:14.320> echo<00:01:14.740> here

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.620 

I'm<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:23.370> shooting<00:01:24.370> these<00:01:24.670> messy<00:01:25.210> internal

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
echoes you can kind of come on the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.710 
echoes you can kind of come on the
outside<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.610> little<00:01:27.790> bit<00:01:28.000> that's<00:01:28.360> cool

rippling<00:01:43.650> effects<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:45.330> several<00:01:46.140> lines<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
rippling effects of several lines of

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.410 
rippling effects of several lines of
quilting<00:01:47.070> around<00:01:47.549> their<00:01:47.790> research<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
quilting around their research and I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.020 
quilting around their research and I
want<00:01:48.690> it<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.080> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.439> messy<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
want it to be kind of messy you know a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.010 
want it to be kind of messy you know a
little<00:01:51.479> overlapping<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.920> cool

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
little overlapping that's cool

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.779 
little overlapping that's cool
it's<00:01:55.020> supposed<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.979> freeform<00:01:56.520> it's

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
it's supposed to be freeform it's

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.240 
it's supposed to be freeform it's
supposed<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.649> wild<00:01:59.039> out<00:01:59.520> here

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
supposed to be a little wild out here

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.300 
supposed to be a little wild out here
and<00:02:02.509> maybe<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.840> tell<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.289> also<00:02:04.440> faster

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and maybe you can tell it's also faster

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.180 
and maybe you can tell it's also faster
to<00:02:05.460> stitch<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.390> think<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.710> standing

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to stitch I think it's really standing

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
to stitch I think it's really standing
out<00:02:08.310> nicely<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:09.149> course<00:02:09.179> they<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.630> quilting

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
out nicely of course they have quilting

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.440 
out nicely of course they have quilting
on<00:02:10.229> black<00:02:10.440> fabric<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.489> think<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.150> looks

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
on black fabric but I think it looks

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.740 
on black fabric but I think it looks
really<00:02:12.750> cool<00:02:13.670> because<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:15.120> getting<00:02:15.480> some

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
really cool because we're getting some

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
really cool because we're getting some
of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> intense<00:02:16.319> lines<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.580> quilting<00:02:17.910> on

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
of the intense lines of quilting on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.350 
of the intense lines of quilting on
building<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.720> top<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.080> each<00:02:19.170> other<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
building up on top of each other and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330 
building up on top of each other and
it's<00:02:21.600> easy<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:21.959> all<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.739> focusing<00:02:23.190> on

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
it's easy because all I'm focusing on

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's easy because all I'm focusing on
doing<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.850> stitching<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.360> initial<00:02:24.840> circle

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
doing is stitching that initial circle

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.850 
doing is stitching that initial circle
shape<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.239> then<00:02:27.239> passing<00:02:27.900> back<00:02:28.140> around<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
shape and then passing back around it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.970 
shape and then passing back around it
like<00:02:29.069> two<00:02:29.340> times<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:31.260> understanding<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
like two times but understanding that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.340 
like two times but understanding that
where<00:02:32.790> my<00:02:33.000> needle<00:02:33.330> goes<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.110> fine<00:02:34.319> I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
where my needle goes it's just fine I

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.680 
where my needle goes it's just fine I
don't<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.799> don't<00:02:34.890> need<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.819> real<00:02:36.150> anal<00:02:36.569> about

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
don't I don't need a be real anal about

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.509 
don't I don't need a be real anal about
this<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.230> don't<00:02:37.410> need<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.709> nitpick<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.340> like

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
this I don't need to nitpick it like

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.160 
this I don't need to nitpick it like
that<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.000> really<00:02:39.329> shrunk<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.840> start

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
that one just really shrunk that start

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.590 
that one just really shrunk that start
without<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.560> that's<00:02:40.620> okay<00:02:41.180> here<00:02:42.180> I'm<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
without it that's okay here I'm going to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.010 
without it that's okay here I'm going to
just<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.260> toss<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.890> piece<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.340> it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
just kind of toss that piece in it

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.190 
just kind of toss that piece in it
that's<00:02:46.020> cool

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
that's cool

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.520 
that's cool
I<00:02:48.260> know<00:02:48.890> from<00:02:49.670> experience<00:02:49.849> that<00:02:50.420> pedaling<00:02:51.319> can

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
I know from experience that pedaling can

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.119 
I know from experience that pedaling can
take<00:02:51.770> me<00:02:51.950> 30<00:02:52.190> minutes<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.989> fill<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.560> small

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
take me 30 minutes to fill a small

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.790 
take me 30 minutes to fill a small
square<00:02:55.580> like<00:02:55.819> this<00:02:55.849> because<00:02:56.840> I'm<00:02:57.080> I'm<00:02:57.470> being

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
square like this because I'm I'm being

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.339 
square like this because I'm I'm being
so<00:02:58.129> picky<00:02:58.370> about<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.629> this<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.319> probably

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
so picky about it and this is probably

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.890 
so picky about it and this is probably
only<00:03:00.769> gonna<00:03:00.980> take<00:03:01.190> me<00:03:01.340> about<00:03:01.550> 15<00:03:02.000> minutes<00:03:02.030> so

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
only gonna take me about 15 minutes so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.309 
only gonna take me about 15 minutes so
I'm<00:03:03.140> cutting<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.620> time<00:03:03.890> down<00:03:05.050> just<00:03:06.050> simply

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
I'm cutting the time down just simply

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.759 
I'm cutting the time down just simply
because<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:06.800> not<00:03:07.010> being<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.410> net<00:03:09.410> thinking

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
because I'm not being so net thinking

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.970 
because I'm not being so net thinking
about<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.360> sometimes<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.840> we<00:03:11.989> can<00:03:12.200> wedge

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
about it sometimes you know we can wedge

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.800 
about it sometimes you know we can wedge
ourselves<00:03:13.489> into<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> corner<00:03:13.849> by<00:03:14.450> our<00:03:14.599> own

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
you know that that circle was not quite

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.309 
you know that that circle was not quite
perfect<00:03:30.920> or<00:03:31.099> whatever<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.730> was<00:03:32.079> but<00:03:33.079> when<00:03:33.260> you

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
perfect or whatever it was but when you

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.920 
perfect or whatever it was but when you
have<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.829> do<00:03:34.579> something<00:03:34.849> free<00:03:35.209> form<00:03:35.510> like<00:03:35.720> this

have to do something free form like this
and<00:03:36.260> more<00:03:36.920> organic<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.819> realize<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.180> there

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
and more organic you realize that there

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.620 
and more organic you realize that there
are<00:03:38.660> no<00:03:38.870> rules<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:40.450> nature<00:03:41.450> isn't

are no rules and that nature isn't
perfect<00:03:42.230> at<00:03:42.319> all<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.579> can<00:03:43.760> get<00:03:43.880> away

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
perfect at all and that you can get away

on your bag so I hope that this is a
freeing<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.390> design<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.110> as<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:51.950> for

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
freeing of a design is it as it is for

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.949 
freeing of a design is it as it is for
me<00:03:52.310> I'm<00:03:52.430> really<00:03:52.790> enjoying<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.630> kind<00:03:53.900> of

me I'm really enjoying just kind of
making<00:03:54.799> this<00:03:55.069> up<00:03:55.250> as<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.519> go

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
making this up as I go

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.470 
making this up as I go
the<00:03:57.799> nice<00:03:58.040> thing<00:03:58.069> about<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.670> is<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.269> know<00:03:59.329> just

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
the nice thing about it is you know just

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.240 
the nice thing about it is you know just
like<00:03:59.660> with<00:03:59.780> pedaling<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.380> change<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.829> size<00:04:01.100> of

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
like with pedaling to change the size of

like with pedaling to change the size of
your<00:04:01.310> circles<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:02.030> little<00:04:02.150> bit<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.889> speak<00:04:03.889> to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
your circles a little bit I speak to

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.180 
your circles a little bit I speak to
playing<00:04:04.340> with<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:04.700> just<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.209> bit<00:04:06.010> if<00:04:07.010> they're

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
playing with that just a bit if they're

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.620 
playing with that just a bit if they're
all<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.489> same<00:04:07.519> size<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.060> shape<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.450> course

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
all the same size and shape of course

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
all the same size and shape of course
that's<00:04:08.930> fine

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
that's fine

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.690 
that's fine
if<00:04:10.489> that's<00:04:10.790> what<00:04:11.060> you're<00:04:11.209> able<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.510> do<00:04:12.700> it's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
if that's what you're able to do it's

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.300 
if that's what you're able to do it's
sometimes<00:04:14.150> nice<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.959> very<00:04:15.500> various

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
sometimes nice to have a very various

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.930 
sometimes nice to have a very various
size<00:04:17.120> simply<00:04:18.079> because<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.400> breaks<00:04:19.609> up<00:04:19.789> the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
size simply because it breaks up the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.879 
size simply because it breaks up the
piece<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.239> have<00:04:20.450> some<00:04:21.049> small<00:04:21.289> ones<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.739> some

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
piece you have some small ones and some

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.469 
piece you have some small ones and some
big<00:04:22.039> ones<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.370> looks<00:04:22.639> more<00:04:22.880> like<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.389> the

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
big ones it looks more like in the

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.029 
big ones it looks more like in the
bottom<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> river<00:04:24.050> bed<00:04:24.320> which<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:24.800> kind<00:04:25.010> of

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
bottom of a river bed which is kind of

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.900 
bottom of a river bed which is kind of
what<00:04:25.160> we're<00:04:25.280> going<00:04:25.430> for

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
what we're going for

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.400 
what we're going for
I<00:04:29.210> would<00:04:30.210> say<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.690> is<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.900> good<00:04:31.200> design

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
I would say that this is a good design

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.190 
I would say that this is a good design
of<00:04:31.800> practice<00:04:32.190> echoing<00:04:32.790> even<00:04:33.690> though<00:04:33.870> I'm<00:04:33.960> not

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
of practice echoing even though I'm not

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.270 
of practice echoing even though I'm not
really<00:04:34.640> intentionally<00:04:35.640> echoing<00:04:36.150> well<00:04:36.450> I

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
really intentionally echoing well I

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.650 
really intentionally echoing well I
think<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.520> would<00:04:38.610> forgive<00:04:39.000> your<00:04:39.240> mistakes

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
think it would forgive your mistakes

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.480 
think it would forgive your mistakes
quite<00:04:40.020> nicely<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:40.980> you're<00:04:41.100> wanting<00:04:41.430> to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
quite nicely so if you're wanting to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.070 
quite nicely so if you're wanting to
learn<00:04:41.790> echoing<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:42.420> might<00:04:42.660> be<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> good

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
learn echoing this might be a good

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.580 
learn echoing this might be a good
design<00:04:43.230> for<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:44.720> also<00:04:45.720> consider<00:04:46.290> calling

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
design for you I also consider calling

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.450 
design for you I also consider calling
this<00:04:47.120> strike<00:04:48.120> rocks<00:04:49.070> because<00:04:50.070> when<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.280> was

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
this strike rocks because when I was

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.880 
this strike rocks because when I was
sketching<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:51.150> out<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.750> kept<00:04:52.110> seeing<00:04:52.350> stripes

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
sketching it out I kept seeing stripes

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.280 
sketching it out I kept seeing stripes
along<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.520> edges<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.150> rocks<00:04:54.360> from<00:04:55.110> the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
along the edges of the rocks from the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.380 
along the edges of the rocks from the
lines<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.740> ethical<00:04:56.310> things<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.060> might<00:04:57.270> be

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
lines of ethical things so that might be

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.850 
lines of ethical things so that might be
another<00:04:57.630> possibility<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.440> want<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.710> call

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
another possibility if you want to call

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.140 
another possibility if you want to call
it<00:04:59.010> something<00:04:59.160> different<00:04:59.670> if<00:04:59.730> you<00:04:59.790> don't<00:05:00.000> like

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
it something different if you don't like

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.420 
it something different if you don't like
underwater<00:05:00.630> rocks

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.999 

I<00:05:08.740> love<00:05:09.740> designs<00:05:10.220> where<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:10.850> rules<00:05:11.680> are<00:05:12.680> less

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
I love designs where the rules are less

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.930 
I love designs where the rules are less
picky<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:15.020> can<00:05:15.259> just<00:05:15.560> set<00:05:16.250> down<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.759> just

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
picky and I can just set down and just

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.600 
picky and I can just set down and just
let<00:05:17.539> it<00:05:17.570> go<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.139> notice<00:05:18.410> my<00:05:18.979> stitches<00:05:19.490> are

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
let it go and you notice my stitches are

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.010 
let it go and you notice my stitches are
getting<00:05:19.970> bigger<00:05:20.240> because<00:05:20.539> I'm<00:05:20.840> actually

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
getting bigger because I'm actually

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.680 
getting bigger because I'm actually
really<00:05:21.590> moving<00:05:22.160> quickly<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.060> actually<00:05:23.360> need

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
really moving quickly so I actually need

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.689 
really moving quickly so I actually need
to<00:05:23.810> speed<00:05:24.139> up<00:05:24.259> my<00:05:24.289> machine<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.860> little<00:05:25.220> bit<00:05:25.370> I

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
to speed up my machine a little bit I

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.580 
to speed up my machine a little bit I
need<00:05:26.449> to<00:05:26.539> put<00:05:26.690> my<00:05:26.810> foot<00:05:27.020> down<00:05:27.880> so<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.060> way<00:05:29.180> my

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
need to put my foot down so that way my

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.680 
need to put my foot down so that way my
machine<00:05:30.590> speed<00:05:30.949> will<00:05:31.330> compensate<00:05:32.330> for<00:05:32.570> the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
machine speed will compensate for the

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.770 
machine speed will compensate for the
speed<00:05:32.960> my<00:05:33.110> hands<00:05:33.380> are<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:33.860> these<00:05:34.780> spaces

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
speed my hands are going these spaces

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.420 
speed my hands are going these spaces
where<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.050> see<00:05:36.229> my<00:05:36.380> stitches<00:05:36.590> just<00:05:37.009> why<00:05:37.190> now

is such a fun freeing organic design it
reminds<00:06:07.009> me<00:06:07.129> a<00:06:07.159> lot<00:06:07.370> of<00:06:07.720> tree<00:06:08.720> bark<00:06:08.930> which<00:06:09.379> is

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
reminds me a lot of tree bark which is
