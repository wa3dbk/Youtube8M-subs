00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
when joseline has a seizure what

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.020 
when joseline has a seizure what
happened<00:00:07.529> was<00:00:07.770> an<00:00:08.010> area<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.639> her<00:00:08.790> brain

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
happened was an area of her brain

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.910 
happened was an area of her brain
decided<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.870> generate<00:00:10.260> abnormal<00:00:10.800> electrical

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
decided to generate abnormal electrical

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.730 
decided to generate abnormal electrical
activity<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.120> an<00:00:12.690> electrical<00:00:13.259> activity

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
activity and an electrical activity

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.259 
activity and an electrical activity
spread<00:00:14.309> across<00:00:14.519> her<00:00:14.820> brain<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.210> they

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
spread across her brain and they

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.150 
spread across her brain and they
disrupted<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> normal<00:00:16.619> behavior<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
disrupted the normal behavior and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.640 
disrupted the normal behavior and
activity<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.609> her<00:00:17.760> brain<00:00:18.109> either<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.439> lose

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
activity of her brain either you lose

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.900 
activity of her brain either you lose
function<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.250> you're<00:00:20.430> supposed<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> have

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
function that you're supposed to have

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.769 
function that you're supposed to have
such<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:22.039> consciousness<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.570> have

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
such as consciousness or you have

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
such as consciousness or you have
abnormal<00:00:25.470> neurological<00:00:26.279> symptoms<00:00:26.670> such<00:00:26.880> as

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
abnormal neurological symptoms such as

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:39.049 
abnormal neurological symptoms such as
movement<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:37.280> when<00:00:38.280> Jocelyn<00:00:38.700> came<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
movement and so on when Jocelyn came to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.229 
movement and so on when Jocelyn came to
us<00:00:39.239> she<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.140> got<00:00:40.559> diagnosed<00:00:41.070> with

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
us she just got diagnosed with

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
us she just got diagnosed with
intractable<00:00:42.239> epilepsy<00:00:43.820> associate<00:00:44.820> with

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000

heavy metal and simply one half of the
brain<00:00:47.730> grew<00:00:48.300> much<00:00:48.809> bigger<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:50.039> much<00:00:50.399> more

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
brain grew much bigger has much more

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.139 
brain grew much bigger has much more
neurons<00:00:51.030> than<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:52.079> necessary<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.120> as<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149

result<00:00:54.690> she<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.620> having<00:00:56.160> almost<00:00:56.610> daily

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
result she was having almost daily

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.380 
result she was having almost daily
seizures<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> operation<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
seizures the operation I like to do is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
seizures the operation I like to do is
something<00:01:00.510> called<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> modified<00:01:01.170> functional

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
something called a modified functional

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
something called a modified functional
hemispherectomy<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.090> big<00:01:03.329> deal<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
hemispherectomy and it's a big deal you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
hemispherectomy and it's a big deal you
know<00:01:03.870> you're<00:01:04.019> gonna<00:01:04.110> remove<00:01:04.439> effectively

know you're gonna remove effectively

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
know you're gonna remove effectively
either<00:01:05.309> anatomically<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.450> functionally

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

either anatomically or functionally
remove<00:01:07.680> half<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.100> someone's<00:01:08.490> brain

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.969 

we<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.990> scared<00:01:14.689> very<00:01:15.689> unsure<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.470> what

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
we were very scared very unsure of what

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.560 
we were very scared very unsure of what
she<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:17.880> she<00:01:18.060> came<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
she would be like when she came out of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
she would be like when she came out of
the<00:01:18.689> surgery<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.680> were<00:01:19.710> worried<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> she

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the surgery we were worried that she

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.469 
the surgery we were worried that she
might<00:01:21.360> lose<00:01:21.539> personality<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:23.210> not<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
might lose personality or not make a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.050 
might lose personality or not make a
good<00:01:24.990> recovery<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> same

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
good recovery from it but at the same

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
good recovery from it but at the same
time<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.689> were<00:01:27.810> desperate<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:29.009> really

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
time we were desperate there really

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240 
time we were desperate there really
weren't<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:29.789> of<00:01:29.850> other<00:01:30.090> options<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.250> know

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
weren't a lot of other options you know

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.889 
weren't a lot of other options you know
I<00:01:32.280> can't<00:01:32.520> imagine<00:01:32.970> being<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> position<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
I can't imagine being in the position of

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.169 
I can't imagine being in the position of
mrs.<00:01:34.229> Dempsey<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.770> other<00:01:35.060> parents<00:01:36.060> of

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
mrs. Dempsey or the other parents of

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.319 
mrs. Dempsey or the other parents of
patients<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.750> say<00:01:37.140> hey<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.149> if<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
patients that we say hey you know if you

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.669 
patients that we say hey you know if you
let<00:01:39.479> us<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.140> child's<00:01:40.500> brain

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
let us take some of your child's brain

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:41.779 
let us take some of your child's brain
out<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.039> really<00:01:41.159> make<00:01:41.310> things<00:01:41.520> better

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
out we can really make things better

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.580 
out we can really make things better
that's<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that's kind of it's a it's a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.320 
that's kind of it's a it's a
conversation<00:01:44.159> nobody<00:01:44.459> wants<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.030> but

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
conversation nobody wants to have but

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.480 
conversation nobody wants to have but
you<00:01:45.959> know<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.470> does<00:01:46.649> work<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
you know it does work and the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.029 
you know it does work and the
alternative<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.229> 1%<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.890> your

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
alternative is you know 1% for your

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.100 
alternative is you know 1% for your
death<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> trajectory

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
death and then you know the trajectory

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
death and then you know the trajectory
for<00:01:52.259> near-normal<00:01:52.649> development<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.369> pretty

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
for near-normal development is pretty

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.070 
for near-normal development is pretty
much<00:01:53.700> obliterated<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
much obliterated I really think that

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.859 
much obliterated I really think that
you're<00:01:55.200> painted<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.770> pretty<00:01:55.979> tight<00:01:56.250> corner

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
you're painted in a pretty tight corner

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.660 
you're painted in a pretty tight corner
and<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.709> the<00:01:58.860> courage<00:01:59.069> to<00:01:59.099> be<00:01:59.399> able<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and to have the courage to be able to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.419 
and to have the courage to be able to
make<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.479> decision<00:02:00.840> early<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> game<00:02:01.799> has

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
make that decision early in the game has

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.550 
make that decision early in the game has
great<00:02:02.640> benefits<00:02:02.789> for<00:02:03.209> your<00:02:03.330> child<00:02:03.630> provided

the<00:02:04.679> surgical<00:02:05.399> team<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.450> things<00:02:06.689> done

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the surgical team can get things done

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.509 
the surgical team can get things done
properly<00:02:09.470> after<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> first<00:02:10.830> surgery<00:02:11.250> I

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
properly after the first surgery I

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.130 
properly after the first surgery I
believe<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:14.040> felt<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:14.519> good<00:02:15.140> dr.

Paul<00:02:16.290> Martin<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> ice<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:17.519> know<00:02:17.640> felt<00:02:17.910> this

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
Paul Martin and ice you know felt this

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.550 
Paul Martin and ice you know felt this
was<00:02:18.359> complete<00:02:18.750> surgery<00:02:19.280> should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.340> good<00:02:21.560> not

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
was complete surgery should be good not

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.490 
was complete surgery should be good not
so<00:02:22.620> much<00:02:22.950> after<00:02:23.340> us<00:02:23.820> several<00:02:24.600> days<00:02:24.720> mother

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so much after us several days mother

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.530 
so much after us several days mother
noticed<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.130> she<00:02:26.519> was<00:02:26.640> having<00:02:26.670> very<00:02:27.090> subtle

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
noticed that she was having very subtle

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.400 
noticed that she was having very subtle
seizures<00:02:28.069> she<00:02:29.069> was<00:02:29.220> still<00:02:29.489> seizing<00:02:29.850> after<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
seizures she was still seizing after the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.750 
seizures she was still seizing after the
second<00:02:31.920> reduce<00:02:32.819> surgery<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:34.760> weren't

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
second reduce surgery and we weren't

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.490 
second reduce surgery and we weren't
sure<00:02:35.970> where<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.390> seizures<00:02:36.690> were<00:02:36.720> originating

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
sure where the seizures were originating

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.990 
sure where the seizures were originating
from<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.100> there<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.400> question<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.760> they

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
from and there was a question that they

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.979 
from and there was a question that they
might<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.269> coming<00:02:39.389> from<00:02:39.660> her<00:02:39.840> right

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
might be coming from her right

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.400 
might be coming from her right
hemisphere<00:02:40.739> which<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.340> good<00:02:41.519> hemisphere

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
hemisphere which was the good hemisphere

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
hemisphere which was the good hemisphere
which<00:02:43.410> was<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> huge<00:02:44.250> huge<00:02:44.850> disappointment

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
which was a huge huge disappointment

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.200 
which was a huge huge disappointment
maybe<00:02:46.319> about<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.709> they

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
maybe about it they

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.020 
maybe about it they
because<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:48.140> assumption<00:02:48.880> somehow<00:02:49.880> human

spectrum will help is that the other

don't need to be humble you get humbled
we<00:03:11.600> are<00:03:11.750> confident<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.440> what<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:12.800> were<00:03:12.890> doing

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
we are confident in what we were doing

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
we are confident in what we were doing
but<00:03:13.430> we<00:03:13.490> knew<00:03:14.120> at<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.420> same<00:03:14.630> time<00:03:14.870> just<00:03:14.900> you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
but we knew at the same time just you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.860 
but we knew at the same time just you
know<00:03:15.740> from<00:03:15.950> looking<00:03:16.160> at<00:03:16.460> her<00:03:16.640> we<00:03:17.420> had<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.720> do

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
know from looking at her we had to do

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:36.440 
know from looking at her we had to do
more<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.740> we<00:03:19.160> took<00:03:19.400> her<00:03:19.550> back

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.490 

we<00:03:37.450> found<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.960> game<00:03:38.520> literally<00:03:39.520> this<00:03:40.390> much<00:03:40.720> was

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
we found a game literally this much was

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.970 
we found a game literally this much was
like<00:03:41.740> less<00:03:42.100> than<00:03:43.170> 0.5<00:03:44.170> centimeter<00:03:44.650> tissue

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
like less than 0.5 centimeter tissue

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.840 
like less than 0.5 centimeter tissue
that<00:03:45.430> was<00:03:45.580> still<00:03:45.910> firing<00:03:46.210> and<00:03:47.100> then<00:03:48.100> there<00:03:48.700> was

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
that was still firing and then there was

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.520 
that was still firing and then there was
I<00:03:49.000> believe<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.600> last<00:03:49.810> surgery<00:03:52.530> usually

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
I believe that last surgery usually

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.340 
I believe that last surgery usually
after<00:03:54.100> six<00:03:54.640> months<00:03:55.030> for<00:03:55.180> him<00:03:55.360> expecting<00:03:55.870> me<00:03:55.990> we

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
after six months for him expecting me we

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.880 
after six months for him expecting me we
feel<00:03:56.620> good<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:58.350> after<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.380> year<00:03:59.830> we<00:04:00.490> feel<00:04:00.730> great

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
feel good and after a year we feel great

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.050 
feel good and after a year we feel great
she<00:04:02.890> has<00:04:03.100> been<00:04:03.430> seizure-free<00:04:03.880> for<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:05.170> year<00:04:05.740> now

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
she has been seizure-free for a year now

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.760 
she has been seizure-free for a year now
so<00:04:07.060> we<00:04:07.210> just<00:04:07.390> had<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.600> celebration<00:04:08.170> with

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
so we just had a celebration with

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.790 
so we just had a celebration with
cupcakes<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.520> everything<00:04:10.320> seeing<00:04:11.320> her<00:04:11.470> take

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
cupcakes and everything seeing her take

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.960 
cupcakes and everything seeing her take
her<00:04:12.130> first<00:04:12.160> steps<00:04:13.440> we<00:04:14.440> doubted<00:04:15.250> at<00:04:15.670> certain

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
her first steps we doubted at certain

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.370 
her first steps we doubted at certain
points<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.600> that<00:04:16.750> was<00:04:16.900> ever<00:04:17.080> gonna<00:04:17.260> happen

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
points that that was ever gonna happen

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.630 
points that that was ever gonna happen
so<00:04:18.010> those<00:04:18.220> really<00:04:18.850> big<00:04:19.210> milestones<00:04:19.989> are<00:04:20.710> loose

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
so those really big milestones are loose

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.580 
so those really big milestones are loose
it's<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:22.060> miracle<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:22.870> us<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.200> just<00:04:23.350> so

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
it's a miracle for us it's just so

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.830 
it's a miracle for us it's just so
remarkable<00:04:24.190> much<00:04:24.400> more<00:04:24.730> than<00:04:24.940> any<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.750> my

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
remarkable much more than any of my

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.219 
remarkable much more than any of my
other<00:04:25.990> children<00:04:26.490> before<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.090> amazing

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.379 

she's<00:04:31.889> gonna<00:04:32.099> really<00:04:32.520> develop<00:04:32.939> much<00:04:33.180> much

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
she's gonna really develop much much

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.980 
she's gonna really develop much much
better<00:04:33.629> in<00:04:34.580> 15<00:04:35.580> years<00:04:35.879> or<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.479> think<00:04:36.659> she's

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
better in 15 years or so I think she's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:53.390 
better in 15 years or so I think she's
gonna<00:04:37.169> be<00:04:37.349> college<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:38.419> hope<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:39.659> I<00:04:39.990> expect<00:04:40.710> that

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.460 

you
