know<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:37.970> do<00:02:38.269> think

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
know that that out of it but I do think

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.809 
know that that out of it but I do think
that<00:02:38.659> that<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.319> something<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.739> we<00:02:40.069> can<00:02:40.280> we're

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
that that is something that we can we're

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:49.380 
that that is something that we can we're
going<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.000> prove<00:02:41.209> now<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.720> yes

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.100 

you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.840 

I<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.830> know<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.160> good<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.730> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
I don't know it's good is that it's a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.900 
I don't know it's good is that it's a
very<00:02:55.060> good<00:02:55.120> point<00:02:55.480> actually<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.790> thought<00:02:57.790> that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
very good point actually I thought that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.100 
very good point actually I thought that
was<00:02:58.030> one<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.630> know<00:02:58.660> really

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
was one of the you know really

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.900 
was one of the you know really
interesting<00:02:59.710> but<00:02:59.860> sort<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.250> questions<00:03:00.670> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
interesting but sort of questions to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.290 
interesting but sort of questions to
come<00:03:01.060> forward<00:03:01.560> really<00:03:02.560> valid<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.730> don't<00:03:04.210> know

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
come forward really valid I don't know

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.980 
come forward really valid I don't know
why<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:05.260> has<00:03:05.470> happened<00:03:06.270> I'm<00:03:07.270> surprised

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
why that that has happened I'm surprised

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.800 
why that that has happened I'm surprised
that<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:09.160> Piccadilly<00:03:09.700> party<00:03:10.120> has<00:03:10.300> thought<00:03:10.570> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
that the Piccadilly party has thought of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.400 
that the Piccadilly party has thought of
as<00:03:10.960> being<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.320> sort<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.010> dance<00:03:12.250> music<00:03:12.430> zone

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
as being a sort of dance music zone

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.500 
as being a sort of dance music zone
rather<00:03:14.410> than<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.800> sort<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.100> India<00:03:16.030> or<00:03:16.150> rock

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
rather than a sort of India or rock

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.490 
rather than a sort of India or rock
music<00:03:16.990> or<00:03:17.640> other<00:03:18.870> forms<00:03:19.870> because<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.350> two

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
music or other forms because the two

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.110 
music or other forms because the two
guys<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:21.220> know<00:03:21.250> put<00:03:21.550> that<00:03:21.700> on<00:03:21.910> are

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
guys that you know put that on are

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.970 
guys that you know put that on are
definitely<00:03:22.480> not<00:03:22.600> dance<00:03:22.900> music<00:03:23.290> heads<00:03:23.500> by<00:03:23.709> any

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
definitely not dance music heads by any

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.380 
definitely not dance music heads by any
means<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.080> shall<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:27.130> shall<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.550> shall<00:03:27.880> Stanley

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
means so I shall I shall I shall Stanley

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.510 
means so I shall I shall I shall Stanley
talk<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.780> them<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.290> particular<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
talk to them in particular but to the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.220 
talk to them in particular but to the
other<00:03:30.550> guys<00:03:30.850> as<00:03:31.030> well<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.630> certainly<00:03:31.810> reduce

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
other guys as well and certainly reduce

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.170 
other guys as well and certainly reduce
that<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.500> think<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.250> reasonably

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
that I think it is a reasonably

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.490 
that I think it is a reasonably
appropriate<00:03:34.660> question

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.490 

yeah<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:42.010> mean<00:03:42.520> we<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.600> know<00:03:43.690> we<00:03:43.840> try<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.140> we<00:03:44.350> do

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
yeah I mean we you know we try it we do

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.070 
yeah I mean we you know we try it we do
try<00:03:44.830> but<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.340> because<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:46.030> always<00:03:46.570> becomes<00:03:46.810> a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
try but it because it always becomes a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.900 
try but it because it always becomes a
sort<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.290> conflict<00:03:47.620> situation<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.490> I<00:03:48.550> don't

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
sort of conflict situation and I don't

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.070 
sort of conflict situation and I don't
really<00:03:49.180> want<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.390> get<00:03:49.480> into<00:03:49.630> conflict

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
really want to get into conflict

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.230 
really want to get into conflict
situations<00:03:51.900> if<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:54.070> know<00:03:54.160> people<00:03:54.490> you<00:03:55.120> know

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
situations if you know people you know

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.810 
situations if you know people you know
we<00:03:55.390> do<00:03:55.960> try<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.230> monitor<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.550> know<00:03:57.670> we

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
we do try and monitor it and you know we

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.590 
we do try and monitor it and you know we
will<00:03:57.970> continue<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.750> sort<00:03:58.960> of<00:03:59.020> press<00:03:59.290> it<00:04:00.600> but

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
will continue to sort of press it but

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.690 
will continue to sort of press it but
peer<00:04:01.840> pressure<00:04:02.140> really<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.980> best<00:04:03.010> way<00:04:03.340> to

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
peer pressure really is the best way to

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.260 
peer pressure really is the best way to
deal<00:04:03.880> with<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:05.400> rather<00:04:06.400> than<00:04:06.610> security

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
deal with that rather than security

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.430 
deal with that rather than security
pressure<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.450> know<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.990> know<00:04:11.110> for<00:04:11.260> every

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
pressure you know for you know for every

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.860 
pressure you know for you know for every
time<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:12.010> know<00:04:12.190> we<00:04:12.340> go<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.030> stop

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
time that you know we go in and stop

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.360 
time that you know we go in and stop
somebody<00:04:14.110> doing<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.890> know<00:04:15.160> the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
somebody doing that you know the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.790 
somebody doing that you know the
security<00:04:15.640> are<00:04:16.330> accused<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.840> being<00:04:17.020> axes<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
security are accused of being axes and

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.310 
security are accused of being axes and
all<00:04:18.730> that<00:04:18.940> sort<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.210> stuff<00:04:19.270> and<00:04:19.690> peer<00:04:20.080> pressure

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
all that sort of stuff and peer pressure

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.110 
all that sort of stuff and peer pressure
is<00:04:20.500> definitely<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.950> best<00:04:21.100> way<00:04:21.280> forward<00:04:21.550> but<00:04:21.940> I

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
is definitely the best way forward but I

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.750 
is definitely the best way forward but I
do<00:04:23.020> hear<00:04:23.380> what<00:04:23.560> what<00:04:23.920> we<00:04:24.070> say<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.310> we<00:04:24.580> will

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
do hear what what we say and we will

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.500 
do hear what what we say and we will
sort<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.150> our<00:04:25.270> best<00:04:25.480> sort<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.900> minimize<00:04:26.260> it
