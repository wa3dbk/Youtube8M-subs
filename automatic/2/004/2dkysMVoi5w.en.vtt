00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.680
 we have this blackberry 9800 this torch 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.960
 one 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.680
 and we see that when we make a call to 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.480
 the screen turns black immediately 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.630
 and this can not happen because that's 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.730
 when in the proximity sensor there 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.119
 is there an obstacle or also 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.640
 the sensor is not focusing the 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.290
 Real information or information 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.309
 appropriate for determining if there is something 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.870
 here or there is not something about the field that he 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.620
 has vision everything we are going to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.600
 do is the following there are two faults a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.260
 let it be why 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.739
 the screws are not tight 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.620
 up or because as in this case has 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.410
 come that they do not have them 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.050
 then we are going to place them and we are going to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.989
 try in case it is not that is 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.450
 because the flex changed it and it went wrong 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.750
 located 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.240
 I'm running 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.890
 from its base and that's why it does not make good 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.890
 contact today let's try 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.570
 let's go back to making the call and 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.210
 we look at archi we have solved that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.330
 fails if we would not have to disarm everything 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.280
 the phone and rearrange the flex 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.620
 but there we see that we can already solve 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.710
 the problem now if you do not put the 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.730
 black screen and that when we put a 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.660
 obstacle there 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.040
 automatically blocks the screen that 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.040
 It's normal for her 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.240
 we can have this fault because 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.960
 we accommodate the flex badly and it is not 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 centered with the circle that he brings there 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 the tactile 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 what is this that we see here is this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.840
 is here next to it illuminates when 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.730
 is igniting and the other one because 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.770
 screws do not look tight or not 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.479
 have them or the touch is lifted 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.520
