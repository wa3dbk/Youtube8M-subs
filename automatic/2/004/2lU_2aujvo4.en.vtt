00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.690
 please tell me what you felt 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.150
 getting the image of freddy mercury firstly i 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.540
 immediately thought about how i will it 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.840
 sing 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:20.210
 because he had by nature very much 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.840
 a cancer voice was originally from 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.099
 drive on high notes i can 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.099
 physically do it 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:53.409
 I try to get as close as possible to him 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.320
 charisma which is so leg 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.949
 energy he just took down all his 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 energy is hurricane to chest wheel here 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.320
 and this is surely plastic 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.100
 exposure to any foot's wife is 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.729
 share all that he does it necessarily 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.640
 it makes sense he is bursting with vocals 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.520
 desire to sing not say about sing and have 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.740
 it happens that in this its 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.240
 so tearing it all down to him 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:30.340
 have to take it from there then and 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:33.940
 I do not hear back, I accompany you 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.759
 in our magic capsule there waiting for you 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.819
 mustache t- shirt and stand for microphone and midge 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.080

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.490

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.099
 looking for troops on 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.080

 with 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.790
 stripped off 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.700
