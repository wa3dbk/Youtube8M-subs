the legendary fourth game what made it

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.340 
the legendary fourth game what made it
so<00:01:46.000> great<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.480> it<00:01:46.900> was<00:01:47.200> like<00:01:47.320> a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
so great is that it was like a

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.650

rebalancing of the series components it

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.930 
rebalancing of the series components it
still<00:01:49.900> plays<00:01:50.230> like<00:01:50.530> four<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:50.830> five<00:01:51.160> but<00:01:51.790> it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
still plays like four and five but it

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.020 
still plays like four and five but it
scales<00:01:52.300> back<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.840> action-movie<00:01:53.530> field
