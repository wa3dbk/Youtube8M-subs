either<00:00:45.970> way<00:00:46.089> no<00:00:47.019> I'm<00:00:47.260> happy<00:00:47.559> with<00:00:47.769> one

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949

either way no I'm happy with one
decision<00:00:48.339> but<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:48.729> think<00:00:48.970> knock<00:00:49.180> down<00:00:49.420> the

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.689 
decision but I think knock down the
difference<00:00:50.500> in<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.680> exact<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.190> heard<00:00:51.430> ruin
