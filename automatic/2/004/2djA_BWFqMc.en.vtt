00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
processor inside the s3 mini but it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
processor inside the s3 mini but it
still<00:01:06.360> provides<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:07.140> very<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:07.979> smooth

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
experience in menus and stuff I think

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
experience in menus and stuff I think
actually<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.299> experience<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> little

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
actually that the experience is a little

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
actually that the experience is a little
bit<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:14.040> bit<00:01:14.070> more<00:01:14.280> smooth<00:01:14.580> here

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
bit more a little bit more smooth here

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
bit more a little bit more smooth here
and<00:01:15.200> jellybean<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.520> in

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and jellybean then what you would get in

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.359 
and jellybean then what you would get in
a<00:01:17.880> new<00:01:18.090> Xperia<00:01:18.570> Z<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.950> course<00:01:19.979> pretty

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
a new Xperia Z so this of course pretty

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
thing also this verbatim for me is the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.890 
thing also this verbatim for me is the
durability<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> device<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.390> as

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
durability of the device and you know as

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.080 
durability of the device and you know as
you<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.290> already<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.460> iPhone<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you probably already know the iPhone is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.859 
you probably already know the iPhone is
like<00:01:33.509> glass<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> front<00:01:35.430> side<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
like glass on the front side and if you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
like glass on the front side and if you
drop<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.920> there's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.180> possibility

can see I have shadow to display a
little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
little bit but this is little bit of a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.600 
little bit but this is little bit of a
scratch<00:02:01.680> I've<00:02:01.950> been<00:02:02.130> getting

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
scratch I've been getting

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
scratch I've been getting
when<00:02:02.939> I've<00:02:03.090> been<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.080> throwing

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
when I've been really you know throwing

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.999 
when I've been really you know throwing
it<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> ground<00:02:06.000> hearted<00:02:06.780> ponies<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it into the ground hearted ponies and it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.190 
it into the ground hearted ponies and it
still<00:02:08.190> works<00:02:08.399> pretty<00:02:08.550> good<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:09.599> also<00:02:09.869> we

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
still works pretty good and then also we

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.250 
still works pretty good and then also we
do<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.769> course<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.760> galaxy<00:02:12.599> note<00:02:12.630> here

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
do have of course my galaxy note here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.430 
do have of course my galaxy note here
that<00:02:13.470> also<00:02:14.459> has<00:02:14.880> some<00:02:14.910> big<00:02:15.599> shutters<00:02:16.019> over

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that also has some big shutters over

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.070 
that also has some big shutters over
here<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.160> screen<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.420> photosphere

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
here on the screen but the photosphere

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.070 
here on the screen but the photosphere
works<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.890> how<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.880> only<00:02:21.180> guess<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.900> if

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
works and how can you only guess that if

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.750 
works and how can you only guess that if
I<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.530> same<00:02:22.799> thing<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.250> an<00:02:23.370> iPhone

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I would do the same thing with an iPhone

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.870 
I would do the same thing with an iPhone
it<00:02:24.090> would<00:02:24.810> shattered<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.680> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.400> easier

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
it would shattered a little bit easier

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.750 
it would shattered a little bit easier
so<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.680> now<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:29.100> also<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.489> course

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
so and right now I'm also of course

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.500 
so and right now I'm also of course

would drop the phone in water there is a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.320 
would drop the phone in water there is a
very<00:02:45.930> possibility<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.819> would<00:02:48.060> survive

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
very possibility that you would survive

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.229

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
easier with the s3 mini just because you

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.820 
easier with the s3 mini just because you
can't<00:02:51.510> take<00:02:51.690> out<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.959> battery<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.709> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
removable battery of course you can't do

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.160 
removable battery of course you can't do
