 It is candy clear First of all we fix with this fuse box paper 800 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.659
 I will 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.290
 If there are two strings for the time being, the paint tends to come off with an error, so it is better to be rough. 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.640
 It is easy to get on the pavement 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.170
 As it is water resistant paper other than then , naturally we will put water 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 Your father's enemy 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.010
 I watered it 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.670
 When only the paper is over, wipe it lightly with a silicone remover and wipe it with a cloth 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.540
 I am getting dirty 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.540
 I'll take it 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.520

 5 Is not seen too much of the nephew along or 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:29.299
 If you wipe off the dirt, take care not to touch it where possible. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.450
 Please take care that oil stains etc. get attached 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.600
 It is continued blow grandfather glue 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.230
 I will explain the role to improve the adhesion of paint 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.420
 The role is to fill in small scratches and bright colors come out 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.780
 You can play this, and if you go from now on twice and shake it well before that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780
 Let's go 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.310
 Be sure to put on a mask before painting First prioritize the place where it is hard to blow the edges etc. 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.310
 After painting is a little easier 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.900
 The surface looks like this when painting 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:23.410
 We will paint evenly and go paint to feel like to be eh j Bae 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:28.060
 Let's wait for it to dry Once the Plasaff gray hardens safely , the next step is to surface it with a paper lathe 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.270
 Is lightly rough and polished to be a tool to use when touching it with your finger 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.210
 When the polish go Masusono 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:40.150
 Because the attention to the end and the like is easy to be worn out so the main place to go to the flat place 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.150
 I will do it in the same way as playing around 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.970
 The sound will change if it's open 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.750
 Expressed much lighter 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.430
 When you finish brushing feel like touching the surface to see if there is a rough place 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.620
 If you do not check 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:04.470
 We will take the other once dirt remover 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:10.019
 Now it's completely pre-processed, but the candy-type pre-processing is from here 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:15.900
 It's a start, and the mainstay of the main dish of the rice is that the candy type has to wipe it off 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:18.610
 The color of the beautiful candy type doesn't come out, so this is the same way as before 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.650
 I will continue to wipe priority Silver particles were 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.650
 Please shake this well as it is accumulated in 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.880
 This is a layer of candy silver This is ok if you wipe it so much 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.190
 Ne 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.140
 If you wipe the candy silver , the surface will look like this metallic 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.140
 I wipe it with my hands dry to some extent 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.020
 Silver is completed with this Can candy next time it falls here when it falls here 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.890
 Definitely 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.670
 It is ok if you choose your own color from here 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:19.760
 And I just don't want to make candy red this time 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.520
 This part of the center that you would like to the gradient is more of the side in silver 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.010
 I want to make candy red 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:31.200
 As for how to blow, it is the first child of lower child 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:35.160
 As you say from mikko and spray it gradually when raising it gradually 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.370
 Gradually it is easy to make a gradient, but let's do it 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.370
 lyrics 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:49.380
 Gradation is lightly made at this stage 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.099
 Say But you have a little pull cat Since this yourself bring up around here Hen 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.849
 Somewhere 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.849
 The temperature is lightly wiped from above obliquely so that it does not fly to the center at that time 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.099
 Gray came now this world up to this place 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:16.889
 I will break into the edge part for a little more 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:20.599
 When I go home, I make a slight slant and blow like this so much red flies towards the center 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.599
 No way pot氣志 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:57.509
 Here Nde gradient I'm not a little bland and unified in one color, which was something like 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.960
 I think it looks like it will look better if you put a sticker etc 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:04.169
 Was 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.600
 You can see that the candy type hits the light, and the silver blew to the place with this kind of feeling 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.390
 It will be sparkling like this 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.970
 Of course this 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.610
 Various colors etc. are changed by the number of times of the collection of the border of this kind of color clear red dog clothes 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:20.800
 Let's pay attention to care too much in the coming of 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:25.630
 And if this candy red dries, the last is here 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.380
 Cab Go rare candy type of color is more and more color and really hit the Toka ultraviolet ray 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.960
 Because it becomes thinner 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:37.160
 Let's keep it clear and protected It will be resistant to ultraviolet light if it is clear and protected 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.760
 At this time , it is a knack to give clear paint at this time 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.760
 I hope Purippuri 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.190
 Say 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.190
 I 'm normal but lyrics 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.050
 Follow 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:07:03.600
 Let's paint the surface feel like it's going to be like this . 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.600
 Know Ikuyo an increasing number 2 stays 2 stage 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.820
 Then we will blow the last 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:39.440
 It's completed, it's high, it's finished by brushing with paper and polishing with compound 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:45.260
 Commercialization of cecal slipper 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:48.420
 Hitting halogen at such a distance during work is also a time saving tip 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:51.800
 The rest is to dry as it is 

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.800
 I will win one day
