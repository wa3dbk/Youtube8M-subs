00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.500
 how do you think that jva beautiful that 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.200
 I would like to work with you 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.700
 talk about the topic today and that 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.500
 how you can make a few 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.559
 at the moment there is growing in hÃ¼lle and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.590
 wealth in many parts of the world that is 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.739
 we first need a woodland where 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.610
 we are growing confused with belarus 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.920
 with the autumn time lots and with the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.089
 leaves of lily of the valley, however, only 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.870
 visually if you are not yet 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.680
 then smell when we fast 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.809
 determine 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.690
 bella has a very high Lauchringen 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.070
 Smells like garlic is 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.070
 Therefore, not so easy 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.289
 confused so we collect at one 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.520
 place where for bellworm grows after 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.899
 motto also let the others know something about 6 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.890
 the leaves are not quite tear out 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.979
 but in the end 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.810
 tear it down so that you can plant it all 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:19.070
 gets ripped off and then we take 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.720
 the fund with you, we can home 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.250
 dry that value now too 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.630
 means we either put it in the best 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.939
 fall into the sun 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.060
 but we can also on the heating 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.920
 I'll do it or I'll do it in 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.990
 my vending machine 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.799
 that means I lay these whole leaves 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.630
 distributed in my vending machine and 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.380
 leave that overnight for about eight 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.290
 to dry for hours 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.360
 the next day the leaves then very much 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.790
 Dry completely free of water 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.299
 dehydrated and we can now do this 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.710
 take leaves and serve them with a mixer 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.320
 for example with the personal blender 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.780
 Here you can make the mountain one 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.680
 grind fine powder 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.479
 that means we have to do it 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.969
 all this is now a fine scroll 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.579
 bear smoke powder and we can do that 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.509
 use throughout the year 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.399
 We also need it if you want to 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.310
 example, want to make pesto pesto 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.870
 So we're on the line too 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.299
 It is usually enough if we for one 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.049
 cup a teaspoon of this powder 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:22.340
 take and then have a delicious 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:26.150
 Aromatic spread of baby leek is like 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.709
 said very healthy rich 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.370
 important minerals rich in 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.370
 vitamin c is also very suitable around 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.959
 to detoxify and detoxify me 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.019
 find very aromatic delicious 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.129

 conserve berlocq preserving that 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.569
