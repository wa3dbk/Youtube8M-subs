00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.890 
this five didn't get said I can't see
anything<00:05:13.210> cuz<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.690> son

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.140 

you<00:05:19.320> can<00:05:19.500> probably<00:05:19.710> see<00:05:20.100> those<00:05:20.280> there<00:05:20.669> now<00:05:20.880> I

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
you can probably see those there now I

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.360 
you can probably see those there now I
just<00:05:22.020> got<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.229> little<00:05:22.320> bit<00:05:22.560> there<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:22.860> just<00:05:23.160> sat

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
just got a little bit there I just sat

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.150 
just got a little bit there I just sat
down<00:05:23.400> at<00:05:23.699> this<00:05:23.820> tree<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.240> have<00:05:24.419> some<00:05:24.630> lunch

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
down at this tree to have some lunch

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.520 
down at this tree to have some lunch
I've<00:05:26.160> got<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.370> little<00:05:26.580> bit<00:05:26.729> there<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.320> got<00:05:28.500> a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
I've got a little bit there and I got a

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.320 
I've got a little bit there and I got a
little<00:05:28.680> bit<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.009> a<00:05:29.280> signal<00:05:29.850> here<00:05:30.060> where<00:05:30.270> the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
little bit of a signal here where the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:38.170 
little bit of a signal here where the
pinkies

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.240 

so<00:05:39.180> there<00:05:39.930> any<00:05:40.080> little<00:05:40.500> but<00:05:40.800> if<00:05:40.980> you<00:05:41.100> get

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
so there any little but if you get

00:05:41.250 --> 00:06:57.730 
so there any little but if you get
enough<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.580> them<00:05:41.700> they<00:05:41.730> are

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:05.290 

like<00:06:58.740> I<00:06:58.890> said<00:06:58.950> they're<00:06:59.280> not<00:06:59.310> big<00:07:00.200> but<00:07:01.200> it's<00:07:01.380> go

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.440 

very<00:07:06.300> fine<00:07:06.720> little<00:07:07.020> signals<00:07:10.700> very<00:07:11.700> shallow

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
very fine little signals very shallow

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.850 
very fine little signals very shallow
small<00:07:13.020> little<00:07:13.290> bits<00:07:13.470> of<00:07:13.590> gold<00:07:13.770> I<00:07:15.740> imagine<00:07:16.740> you

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
small little bits of gold I imagine you

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:26.340 
small little bits of gold I imagine you
can<00:07:16.980> see<00:07:17.220> that<00:07:17.400> from<00:07:17.520> me

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.350 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.270 

well<00:07:26.950> nearly<00:07:27.400> jump

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.280 

it<00:07:32.000> is<00:07:32.180> there<00:07:33.880> okay<00:07:34.880> that's<00:07:35.450> number<00:07:35.720> six<00:07:36.110> for

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.290 
it is there okay that's number six for

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.460 
it is there okay that's number six for
the<00:07:36.380> day<00:07:37.150> so<00:07:38.150> if<00:07:38.510> they<00:07:38.630> keep<00:07:38.870> coming<00:07:39.200> in<00:07:39.290> like

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
the day so if they keep coming in like

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.159 
the day so if they keep coming in like
that<00:07:39.500> only<00:07:40.100> about<00:07:40.280> 10:30<00:07:40.850> you'd<00:07:41.810> probably<00:07:42.020> end

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.169 
that only about 10:30 you'd probably end

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.310 
that only about 10:30 you'd probably end
up<00:07:42.350> with<00:07:42.530> 1520<00:07:43.430> little<00:07:43.639> bits<00:07:43.870> so<00:07:44.870> we'll<00:07:45.139> see

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.320 
up with 1520 little bits so we'll see

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.580 
up with 1520 little bits so we'll see
how<00:07:45.470> it<00:07:45.590> goes<00:07:45.650> bye<00:07:46.280> for<00:07:46.550> now
