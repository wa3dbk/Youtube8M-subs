00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.899
 we went to the next topic 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.699
 the android market 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.179
 he looks very good 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.529
 although not as neat as the applications 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.789
 on the home screen appear recommended applications 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 up here in the first separation between applications 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.989
 and games 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.259
 in giving so you can see what you are downloading 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.310
 Currently there is no active download 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.730
 but you can also see the applications that are already installed base 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.280
 You can say that in them 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.370
 and you can even uninstall it or ask for it 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.540
 there is no way to uninstall desktop applications using a shortcut 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.540
 as it happens on the iphone good palm pre 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.920
 then search for applications 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.480
 up here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.680
 you can do it either through the screen keyboard 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.740
 which also works in landscape mode 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.050
 which it's 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.580
 However 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.650
 they take 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.130
 more than half the screen 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.540
 with which there is not much respect 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.710
 or you can use the physical keyboard as you can see the keyboard 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 the screen does not work anymore when you have opened the physical keyboard which has 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.750
 absolute sense 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.110
 another thing you can see now 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.340
 is that the little holder up here 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 at the beginning I had not even noticed his presence 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 until it is in that place 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.340
 if the battery is low, they blink red 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.250
 if you received notifications as it happened to me 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.040
 I just received a and Medellin 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.510
 pardal in green and notifies you of something that has happened 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.469
 the reason why it is notified 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.149
 is that there were and read notifications with which there is no 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.820
 reason for visar media no news 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.399
 the notifications will also see the alternative to delete them 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 as you see now everything is clean 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.940
 and at least you see more congratulations 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.890
 Israeli notifications are no longer 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.419
 very well let's go back to the market 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.929
 the applications are well ordered 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:13.539
 I can look at all 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.959
 to the fun to the efficiency tools by the system 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.349
 those of finance 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 what your heart demands 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.229
 in this place there are more than 10 thousand applications 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.669
 compared to 100 thousand that the iphone has 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.339
 or the five hundred that the palm pre has 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:34.069
 is that while palm just enters the market the android 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.069
 already exists for a little while longer 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.280
 we have already seen the notifications of and a half then it may be timely 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.199
 take a look at SMEs 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.009
 the club and has two mail clients 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.000
 one for google mail 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.860
 and the other 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.859
 for imedi 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.159
 the client in google measure as the name suggests 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.269
 only works with tinelli 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.199
 Here you can install several accounts of the Sinai you will have a list of your and 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.209
 month and you can specify that through them 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.619
 when you enter these visits peas that the conversations are being 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.159
 charged 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.980
 this means that the team loads both smedins and those that can be seen 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.029
 at the beginning I was wondering 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.029
 because there is no option to load them and month of born weeks 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.279
 previous 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.299
 but it ends up being practical because they only load what is happening in 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.599
 that moment 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.599
 the practice has been working in the same way 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.570
 this is the application and corn 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.319
 Here you can see my e-mail accounts 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.779
 I have only two 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 but you can actually install an unlimited number of accounts 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.159
 has a combined e-mail box where you can see all the crimes 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.739
 unified 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.409
 on the left there is a color code my private color account 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.109
 orange 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.459
 brick beasts pink 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.519
 I'll take a look without adjusting the colors since the pink does not please me 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.479
 too 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.419
 in the combined box to find a large amount and month of business 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.520
 pink 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.739
 and here below 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.559
 some researched orange 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.780
 a very practical way to keep your communication for nothing 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.199
 if you want to set up a new email account it's pretty easy 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.470
 only menu price 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.449
 Contextually pressed added to account 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.379
 entered or measure and his peace were 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.029
 and from that point 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.389
 the phone will try to resolve the settings by itself 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.559
 and if you can not find your ebay server inc 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.539
 you can do it manually by entering the information 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.990
 missing 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.909
 you can set many things 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.240
 percent in my email client 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.340
 just received 1 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.199
 entered the settings 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.010
 and I can change the name of the account 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.580
 my name 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.060
 the frequency can be set as the default account from which to send 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.860
 the mails 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.460
 if I want notifications 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.430
 adjust renton 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.290
 the migratory alert with which when it receives at a level 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.930
 the phone also lived 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.240
 I can also modify the incoming and outgoing mail server 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.949
 so 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.610
 can be adjusted 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.599
 everything you can think of nothing is out 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.559
 even supports security settings 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.559
 let me show hair 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.639
 here you can see that he accepts ssl 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.719
 iata to ssl certificates 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.719
 the same happens with the tlc 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.060
 this is undoubtedly very practical and I find a great lack in the palm 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.610
 pre 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.610
 that does not accept the ssl self certified 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.740
 this implies in practice 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.960
 that was unprecedented in this team was not accepted here in the teacher if 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.889
 works 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:02.870
 With which 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.870
 the ime and is very well thought 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.360
 put and 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.809
 one in one 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:19.479
 there was no hand in hand
