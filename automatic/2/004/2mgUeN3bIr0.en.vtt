00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello to all I am me that ashes 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.639
 so in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.900
 show how to fold this plane first 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.150
 it takes a quarter and here we take a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.150
 quarter and have the most once in two 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.150
 then for the withdrawal in the other direction 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.910
 this is petrol bends in half with 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.160
 a month ago I did wrong 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:09.229
 then will be called in two years 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:13.080
 yet in the other direction 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:23.759
 then we take that part and we 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:26.150
 including it in fact the same thing 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.150
 the other side 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:44.330
 then we fold in two like that 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.840
 so as to have a square that be this 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.840
 side there too 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.140
 then we will recover at 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.900
 inside a small side a dish on 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.130
 will shoot him and we will do that for all 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.130
 the sides 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:37.470
 go gossip last then we will folded 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.470
 one side out 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.790
 here but in front of this same side 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.350
 then we'll bend like that with 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.370
 the same thing on our side 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.940
 then we have it 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.940
 abnormally
