like<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.069> really<00:03:08.370> old<00:03:08.400> story<00:03:09.000> we<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.329> to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
like a really old story we have to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.819 
like a really old story we have to
retire<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:10.019> if<00:03:10.290> we're<00:03:10.380> gonna<00:03:10.500> do

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
retire because if we're gonna do

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.460 
retire because if we're gonna do
anything<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.370> move<00:03:11.880> anything<00:03:12.299> forward<00:03:12.900> it's

kindness<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.320> wrote<00:03:16.650> about<00:03:16.799> just<00:03:17.370> being

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
kindness and so I wrote about just being

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.480 
kindness and so I wrote about just being
kind<00:03:17.850> generally<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.870> no<00:03:19.079> matter

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
kind generally like no matter

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.210 
kind generally like no matter
white<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:20.390> also<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:21.140> kind<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.470> spun<00:03:21.770> off<00:03:21.950> into

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
white but also it kind of spun off into

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.880 
white but also it kind of spun off into
this<00:03:22.340> bigger<00:03:22.600> metaphysical<00:03:23.600> idea<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.170> you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
this bigger metaphysical idea of you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.650 
this bigger metaphysical idea of you
know<00:03:25.010> if<00:03:25.220> we<00:03:25.340> could<00:03:25.460> think<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.820> our<00:03:25.970> words<00:03:26.300> as

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
know if we could think of our words as

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.020 
know if we could think of our words as
being<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:28.010> know<00:03:28.130> having<00:03:28.280> some<00:03:28.550> charge<00:03:28.790> or

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
being you know having some charge or

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.490 
being you know having some charge or
heft<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.390> they<00:03:29.570> go<00:03:29.690> out<00:03:29.840> in<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.080> world<00:03:30.260> and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
heft that they go out in the world and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.530 
heft that they go out in the world and
they<00:03:30.590> actually<00:03:30.800> trigger<00:03:31.190> things<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.420> know

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
they actually trigger things you know

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.720 
they actually trigger things you know
that<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.170> actual<00:03:33.530> air<00:03:33.800> like<00:03:34.070> yeah<00:03:34.370> it's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
that so the actual air like yeah it's

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.430 
that so the actual air like yeah it's
like<00:03:34.820> it's<00:03:35.210> like<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.600> mean<00:03:35.840> thing<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.230> might

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
like it's like the mean thing you might

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.530 
like it's like the mean thing you might
say<00:03:36.770> it's<00:03:37.280> like<00:03:37.400> air<00:03:37.580> pollution<00:03:37.760> right<00:03:38.270> like

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
say it's like air pollution right like

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.540 
say it's like air pollution right like
the<00:03:38.690> gossip<00:03:39.140> or<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.410> backbiting<00:03:39.860> exactly

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
the gossip or the backbiting exactly

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.710 
the gossip or the backbiting exactly
it's<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:40.760> it's<00:03:41.090> like<00:03:41.210> eating<00:03:41.360> through<00:03:41.630> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
it's like it's like eating through the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.360 
it's like it's like eating through the
ozone<00:03:41.990> layer<00:03:42.170> like<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.680> actually<00:03:42.800> like<00:03:43.190> a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
ozone layer like it's actually like a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.250 
ozone layer like it's actually like a
kind<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.760> weird<00:03:44.000> fusion<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.540> environmentalism

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
kind of weird fusion of environmentalism

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.050 
kind of weird fusion of environmentalism
and<00:03:45.530> spirituality<00:03:46.250> if<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.430> think<00:03:46.670> about<00:03:46.790> like

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060
