00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.799
 very good to everyone i am berlin 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.570
 I am a welcome to this third 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.770
 update in which he talks about that 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.330
 flower change that occurred 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.100
 little in the channel the big ad 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.449
 missing for data besides talking to us 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.199
 of the possible content that upload in the 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.260
 next months 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.580
 let's start as it says in the video 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.170
 soon in the series that I had 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.030
 foreseen the honor of a spartan has 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.680
 canceled or at least stopped 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.079
 because of the great spartan announcement 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.640
 season 2 some will ask the 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.890
 why of this decision so 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 I will try to explain it briefly halo 4 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 It sucks to make machine and more 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 basically you could say that I am a 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.030
 compulsive perfectionist for my 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.560
 machin and more I'm never satisfied with 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.060
 everything with my projects and even less with 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.530
 my first videos so my 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.360
 person prevented me from making the mistake of a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.920
 spartan with all the tons of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 bugs that have halo 4 to do more 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 indie more and besides the story was not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.020
 everything thought that should 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.370
 all this together made me think 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 in the second option the second 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.400
 Great Spartan season began to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.750
 spin around and I realized that it's 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.850
 a series that could have much more 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.410
 future there are only six great chapters 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.640
 spartan and for all the game that is 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.990
 can draw a series in which 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 the characters participate more 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.040
 representative of the mancini more 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.810
 Hispanics are somewhat short but as 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 I could continue the idea of ​​making a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.960
 movie with nico's life was still there 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.150
 but I came up with a better idea what 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 would happen if only he would return what would happen if 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 all those people who avenge 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.759
 forest in its plan the PSOE itself was 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.140
 a second season all the ancients 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.210
 contestants will be the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.560
 protagonists oscar georges ni querer 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.390
 drug luppi will be back to the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 second season of course there will be 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 new characters from this world of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.220
 the machine and more and they will also come back 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.600
 old characters plus the series of give 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.130
 a greater focus on niko since now 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.509
 everyone knows what it is like and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.340
 I assure you that the rules of the program 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.690
 they will change now 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 you will wonder how it goes back 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.530
 program and that will change exactly but 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.230
 You will have to wait for the trailer to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.760
 know that information and there he continued with 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.000
 the question that you all want to know 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.040
 when and I answer when it's ready 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.870
 but of course it will not be soon for 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.340
 you make your idea the script is not even going 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.990
 in half and I'll be inactive a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.330
 time so I would not expect this 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.920
 summer or kidding now after that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.780
 type in which you will be inactive in that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.370
 we will work for a while now I have 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.960
 thought several ideas in the head 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.760
 among them I would like to try to do 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.990
 some criticism in the beginning 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.730
 would start with the saga assassin's creed 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.200
 which marked me a lot but in 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.880
 my opinion is deviating from what 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.160
 it was originally going to be and someone has 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.930
 that criticize that of course there are 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.310
 the random cinema if the funds me 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.930
 I would love to make a fan dub of the video 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.400
 so exhausted but I'm not sure if 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.750
 in the end he ends up thanking him also 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.250
 I had thought of making some video 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.330
 special as a top-ten themis 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.490
 preferred video games of this 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.380
 generation for example I would like to know 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.880
 what do you think of all these ideas but 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.920
 meanwhile I remind you that you have the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.690
 secondary channel of play whose link is 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.160
 in the Canadian description in which by 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.870
 right now I could upload videogames for 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.069
 higher graphic quality since inside 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.260
 of little I acquired from a no 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.420
 and if it is one of the reasons why 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.040
 I will be active a while but 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.439
 calm that activity is going to be a 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.629
 penalty taking into account the frequency with 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:01.440
 which uploads videos a month is nothing 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.480
 worrying you close the fucking mouth 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.970
 close your fucking mouth you know that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.310
 you should do less talk and write 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.200
 more machinima d'or de pototilla by 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.200
