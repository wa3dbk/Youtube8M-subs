dry ingredients in the pancake mixture

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.700 
dry ingredients in the pancake mixture
so<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.660> need<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> keep<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.320> all<00:00:34.530> that's

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
just come off the bacon as we're gonna

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.450 
just come off the bacon as we're gonna
be<00:00:36.840> using<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.530> pancakes<00:00:38.010> later<00:00:38.190> on

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
be using that for the pancakes later on

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.600 
be using that for the pancakes later on
and<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.330> very<00:00:39.570> carefully<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:41.400> we<00:00:41.489> can

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and do this very carefully so now we can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.130 
and do this very carefully so now we can
get<00:00:41.730> started<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> pancake<00:00:42.570> mix<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
get started on the pancake mix and this

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
get started on the pancake mix and this
is<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> super<00:00:43.830> easy<00:00:43.950> method<00:00:44.400> because<00:00:44.790> pretty

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is a super easy method because pretty

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.100 
is a super easy method because pretty
much<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.570> gonna<00:00:45.660> put<00:00:45.840> everything

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
much we're just gonna put everything

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
much we're just gonna put everything
into<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> blender<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.580> rather

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
into a blender and do it in there rather

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
into a blender and do it in there rather
than<00:00:48.210> beading<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:48.720> by<00:00:48.870> hand<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
than beading all by hand I like this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.960 
than beading all by hand I like this
method<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.400> then<00:00:50.550> you've<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
method because then you've got it in the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.280 
method because then you've got it in the
jug<00:00:51.150> as<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.629> makes<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:51.930> an<00:00:52.020> easy<00:00:52.199> way

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
jug as well which makes for an easy way

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.200 
jug as well which makes for an easy way
to<00:00:52.410> pour<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> pancake<00:00:53.309> mixture<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> pan

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to pour the pancake mixture into the pan

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.670 
to pour the pancake mixture into the pan
so<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.720> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.900> crack<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> egg<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.440> first

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
so I'm going to crack the egg in first

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
so I'm going to crack the egg in first
and<00:00:55.920> give<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> quick<00:00:56.340> pulse<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:01.050> add<00:01:01.230> in
