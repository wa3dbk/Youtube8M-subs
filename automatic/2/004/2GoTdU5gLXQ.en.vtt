but there's no concrete filling to be
done<00:00:29.340> okay<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.910> basically<00:00:30.619> stackable<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
done okay it's basically stackable you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
done okay it's basically stackable you
bury<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.219> row<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.270> stack<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.750> from

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
bury one row and you stack it up from

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
bury one row and you stack it up from
there<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.290> way<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> works<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
there and the way it works is it's got a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
there and the way it works is it's got a
lint<00:00:36.390> behind<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.290> block<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.800> pull<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.100> piece

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
lint behind the block I pull that piece

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
lint behind the block I pull that piece
up<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> look<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:40.219> it's<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
up and look like a look at it's got a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.860

up to the back of that the bottom row so
when<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> dirt<00:00:48.840> behind<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> wall<00:00:49.590> pushes<00:00:50.039> up

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
when the dirt behind the wall pushes up

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
when the dirt behind the wall pushes up
against<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.640> block<00:00:51.020> that's<00:00:52.020> actually

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
against this block that's actually

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
against this block that's actually
holding<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> wall<00:00:53.190> itself<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.360> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
holding up the wall itself so it's a

this<00:01:34.619> block<00:01:34.829> when<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.180> curbs<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.570> these

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this block when you put curbs in these

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.999 
this block when you put curbs in these
walls<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.350> makes<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.890> out

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
walls it really makes a little bit out

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
walls it really makes a little bit out
up<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.430> out<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:39.150> let's<00:01:39.329> take<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> quick

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
up to get out okay let's take a quick

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.969 
up to get out okay let's take a quick
angle<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.590> kind<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> see

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
angle out here and you can kind of see

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.670 
angle out here and you can kind of see
it<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> other<00:01:43.020> side<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it and on the other side it's going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.639 
it and on the other side it's going to
have<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:45.420> strong<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> Ranger<00:01:46.470> yeah

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
have a lot of strong the Ranger yeah

have a lot of strong the Ranger yeah
we'll<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> look<00:01:47.100> at<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.369> enough<00:01:47.520> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we'll take a look at that in enough so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 
we'll take a look at that in enough so
how<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.329> how<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> prep<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.439> how<00:01:49.530> do

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
how do we how to do the prep like how do

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.719 
how do we how to do the prep like how do
we<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.009> stuff<00:01:50.250> ready<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.610> install

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
we get this stuff ready to install

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
we get this stuff ready to install
what's<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> first<00:01:51.509> step<00:01:51.780> well<00:01:52.020> basically<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
what's the first step well basically you

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
what's the first step well basically you
dig<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> tricky<00:01:53.100> dig<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> trench<00:01:53.520> okay<00:01:54.030> now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
dig that tricky dig a trench okay now

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
dig that tricky dig a trench okay now
and<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:54.869> leveling<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.560> yeah<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and you're leveling it out yeah now you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.730 
and you're leveling it out yeah now you
want<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> bury<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.689> full<00:01:57.930> block<00:01:58.140> uh-huh

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
want to bury one full block uh-huh

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.170 
want to bury one full block uh-huh
depending<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.340> how<00:01:59.549> high<00:01:59.729> you're<00:01:59.909> gonna<00:01:59.969> go

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
depending on how high you're gonna go

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
depending on how high you're gonna go
this<00:02:00.329> being<00:02:00.659> only<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.290> feet<00:02:01.590> high<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.280> know

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this being only two feet high you know

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.620 
this being only two feet high you know
you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.759> away<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.210> bearing<00:02:03.479> one

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you can get away with just bearing one

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can get away with just bearing one
block<00:02:03.840> okay<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> basically<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:07.140> have

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
block okay and so you basically you have

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.469 
block okay and so you basically you have
to<00:02:07.409> level<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> very<00:02:08.039> first<00:02:08.280> row

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
to level at the very first row

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.430 
to level at the very first row
graphically<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> hardest<00:02:10.140> part<00:02:10.319> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
graphically that's the hardest part and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.900 
graphically that's the hardest part and
then<00:02:10.679> they're<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.459> stacking<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
then they're not it's just stacking the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.559 
then they're not it's just stacking the
blocks<00:02:12.000> up

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
blocks up

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.870 
blocks up
oh<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.080> pretty<00:02:13.200> easy<00:02:13.349> after<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
oh so it's pretty easy after the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.820 
oh so it's pretty easy after the
after<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> shot<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.990> first<00:02:15.170> row<00:02:15.410> as<00:02:15.590> long<00:02:15.740> as

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
after a shot the first row as long as

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.530 
after a shot the first row as long as
the<00:02:15.890> first<00:02:16.100> real<00:02:16.220> solid<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:17.180> gonna<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.420> good

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
the first real solid it's gonna be good

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.060 
the first real solid it's gonna be good
if<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:17.870> not<00:02:18.050> when<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.440> get<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> top<00:02:18.950> of

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
if it's not when you get to the top of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.170 
if it's not when you get to the top of
the<00:02:19.130> wall<00:02:19.250> you're<00:02:19.400> gonna<00:02:19.490> see<00:02:19.730> you're<00:02:20.120> gonna

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the wall you're gonna see you're gonna

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.550 
the wall you're gonna see you're gonna
see<00:02:20.300> where<00:02:20.510> when<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:20.870> look<00:02:21.050> at<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.470> know

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
see where when you go look at you know

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.230 
see where when you go look at you know
I've<00:02:21.800> seen<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.280> some<00:02:22.490> some<00:02:22.970> cheaper

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
I've seen that on some some cheaper

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.970 
I've seen that on some some cheaper
projects<00:02:23.660> where<00:02:23.870> people<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.320> didn't<00:02:24.590> didn't

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
projects where people just didn't didn't

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.320 
projects where people just didn't didn't
stack<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.310> right<00:02:25.340> really<00:02:25.850> doesn't<00:02:26.090> look<00:02:26.180> right

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
stack it right really doesn't look right

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.580 
stack it right really doesn't look right
the<00:02:26.510> scenes<00:02:26.690> don't<00:02:26.930> line<00:02:27.080> up<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.440> blocks

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the scenes don't line up the blocks

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.190 
the scenes don't line up the blocks
don't<00:02:27.830> line<00:02:27.980> up<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.250> top<00:02:28.430> yeah<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.360> uh<00:02:29.390> so

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
don't line up on top yeah so uh so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.480 
don't line up on top yeah so uh so
that's<00:02:30.320> basically<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.070> when<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> stack

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
that's basically and then when you stack

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.680 
that's basically and then when you stack
in<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.700> blocks<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.000> make<00:02:32.270> sure<00:02:32.390> there's<00:02:32.570> no

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
in the blocks just make sure there's no

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.450 
in the blocks just make sure there's no
rocks<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.080> between<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.560> everything<00:02:33.860> okay<00:02:34.280> and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
rocks in between and everything okay and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.950 
rocks in between and everything okay and
there<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> drainage<00:02:35.060> system<00:02:35.210> behind<00:02:35.840> this

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
there is a drainage system behind this

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.140 
there is a drainage system behind this
wall<00:02:36.260> tell<00:02:37.010> me<00:02:37.070> tell<00:02:37.430> me<00:02:37.460> some<00:02:37.640> about<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.970> so

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
what we have we have the ditch first and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.710 
what we have we have the ditch first and
then<00:02:40.100> we<00:02:40.400> fill<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> with<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.060> Scrabble<00:02:41.510> right

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
then we fill it with the Scrabble right

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.320 
then we fill it with the Scrabble right
and<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.980> 3/8<00:02:43.430> inch<00:02:43.610> crushed<00:02:44.090> rock

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and this is just a 3/8 inch crushed rock

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.300 
and this is just a 3/8 inch crushed rock
gravel<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.470> goes<00:02:45.620> down<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.220> in

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
gravel all right that goes down just in

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.350 
gravel all right that goes down just in
the<00:02:46.370> bottom<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.730> ditch<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:47.210> how's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the bottom of the ditch and then how's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.850 
the bottom of the ditch and then how's
this<00:02:47.390> range<00:02:47.720> system<00:02:48.080> work<00:02:48.230> okay<00:02:48.650> basically

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
this range system work okay basically

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.640 
this range system work okay basically
behind<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.580> wall<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.270> about<00:02:50.510> 8<00:02:51.410> inches

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
behind the wall we have about 8 inches

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.400 
behind the wall we have about 8 inches
of<00:02:52.010> gravel<00:02:52.250> all<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.150> way<00:02:53.270> down<00:02:53.480> okay<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.350> at

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
of gravel all the way down okay and at

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.380 
of gravel all the way down okay and at
the<00:02:54.530> bottom<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:54.980> wall<00:02:55.160> there's<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.610> three

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the bottom of the wall there's a three

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.000 
the bottom of the wall there's a three
inch<00:02:56.600> drain<00:02:57.080> pipe<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:57.560> called<00:02:57.710> a<00:02:57.770> French

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
inch drain pipe it's called a French

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.310 
inch drain pipe it's called a French
drain<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.730> perforated<00:02:59.360> pipe<00:02:59.570> it<00:03:00.110> just

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
drain it's a perforated pipe it just

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.860 
drain it's a perforated pipe it just
runs<00:03:00.590> along<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> bottom<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:02.480> being<00:03:02.660> is

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
runs along the bottom so this being is

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.500 
runs along the bottom so this being is
this<00:03:03.140> being<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.560> slope<00:03:04.430> here<00:03:04.670> when<00:03:05.210> it<00:03:05.300> rains

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
this being a slope here when it rains

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.450 
this being a slope here when it rains
all<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.810> water<00:03:06.080> comes<00:03:06.380> down<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:07.220> don't<00:03:07.370> have

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
all the water comes down you don't have

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.670 
all the water comes down you don't have
a<00:03:07.520> any<00:03:08.240> release<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.750> pressure<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.260> it's

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
a any release of pressure here it's

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.140 
a any release of pressure here it's
gonna<00:03:09.860> all<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.460> weight<00:03:10.610> on<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.820> wall<00:03:11.030> it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
gonna all that weight on this wall it's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
gonna all that weight on this wall it's
going<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.330> eventually<00:03:11.560> bring<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.710> over<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.130> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
going to eventually bring it over so the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.940 
going to eventually bring it over so the
water<00:03:14.120> comes<00:03:14.390> down<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:15.020> hits<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.440> gravel<00:03:15.860> it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
water comes down it hits the gravel it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.260 
water comes down it hits the gravel it
rains<00:03:16.190> all<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.400> way<00:03:16.550> bottom<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.030> Train

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
rains all the way bottom to the Train

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.210 
rains all the way bottom to the Train
and<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:18.110> releases<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.710> pressure<00:03:18.830> all<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.160> way

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
and it releases the pressure all the way

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.430 
and it releases the pressure all the way
down<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.550> wall<00:03:19.580> okay<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:21.020> really<00:03:21.260> cool

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
down the wall okay so it's a really cool

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.120 
down the wall okay so it's a really cool
and<00:03:21.800> easy<00:03:21.950> thing<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.400> install<00:03:22.490> as<00:03:22.790> well<00:03:22.940> okay

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
and easy thing to install as well okay

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.890 
and easy thing to install as well okay
so<00:03:25.130> that's<00:03:25.340> your<00:03:25.460> so<00:03:26.030> one<00:03:26.330> one<00:03:26.630> thing<00:03:26.780> I've

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
so that's your so one one thing I've

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.480 
so that's your so one one thing I've
always<00:03:26.990> wanted<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.350> know<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.680> how<00:03:27.830> do<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.040> edit

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
always wanted to know is how do you edit

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.920 
always wanted to know is how do you edit
the<00:03:28.640> level<00:03:28.850> right<00:03:29.000> on<00:03:29.120> these<00:03:29.240> things<00:03:29.390> because

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
the level right on these things because

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.030 
the level right on these things because
when<00:03:30.200> you're<00:03:30.320> dealing<00:03:30.440> with<00:03:30.680> something<00:03:30.920> that

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
when you're dealing with something that

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.800 
when you're dealing with something that
goes<00:03:31.220> from<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.610> know<00:03:31.730> over<00:03:32.330> there<00:03:32.450> all<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
goes from you know over there all the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.210 
goes from you know over there all the
way<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.960> over<00:03:33.200> there<00:03:33.350> like<00:03:33.590> 100<00:03:33.950> feet<00:03:34.100> or

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
way to over there like 100 feet or

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.800 
way to over there like 100 feet or
something<00:03:34.550> how<00:03:35.060> do<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.240> how<00:03:35.660> do<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.750> make

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
something how do you how do you make

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.720 
something how do you how do you make
sure<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.050> block<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.980> know<00:03:37.070> way<00:03:37.370> over<00:03:37.580> there

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
sure that block you know way over there

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.240 
sure that block you know way over there
is<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.540> same<00:03:38.750> as<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.650> one<00:03:39.770> on<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.920> other<00:03:39.950> side

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
is the same as the one on the other side

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.620 
is the same as the one on the other side
where<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:40.910> different<00:03:41.210> methods<00:03:41.510> one

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
where you can just different methods one

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.170 
where you can just different methods one
you<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:41.870> use<00:03:41.960> a<00:03:41.990> laser<00:03:42.170> level<00:03:42.640> or<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.970> can<00:03:44.120> do

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
you can use a laser level or you can do

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.700 
you can use a laser level or you can do
a<00:03:44.210> string<00:03:44.540> level<00:03:44.840> now<00:03:44.960> when<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.440> straight

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
a string level now when it's a straight

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.220 
a string level now when it's a straight
wall<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.520> can<00:03:46.670> basically<00:03:46.850> just<00:03:47.630> stretch<00:03:48.200> a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
wall you can basically just stretch a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.650 
wall you can basically just stretch a
string<00:03:48.590> out<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:49.010> level<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.670> string<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.210> just

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
string out and level the string and just

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.030 
string out and level the string and just
follow<00:03:50.840> your<00:03:51.080> string<00:03:51.320> but<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.680> being<00:03:51.890> a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
follow your string but this being a

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.130 
follow your string but this being a
curved<00:03:52.280> wall<00:03:52.520> there's<00:03:53.240> no<00:03:53.300> string<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.720> follow

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
curved wall there's no string to follow

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.470 
curved wall there's no string to follow
so<00:03:54.740> you're<00:03:54.920> basically<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:56.090> could<00:03:56.240> use<00:03:56.450> a

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
so you're basically you could use a

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.270 
so you're basically you could use a
string<00:03:56.960> level<00:03:57.260> like<00:03:57.380> basically<00:03:57.770> from<00:03:57.950> here

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
string level like basically from here

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.300 
string level like basically from here
and<00:03:58.460> take<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.030> down<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.570> to<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.160> makes

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
and take it down to to that and it makes

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.350 
and take it down to to that and it makes
sure<00:04:01.400> it's<00:04:01.520> level<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:01.850> basically<00:04:02.210> we're

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
sure it's level but basically we're

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.330 
sure it's level but basically we're
running<00:04:02.600> like<00:04:02.750> leveling<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.620> as<00:04:03.800> we<00:04:03.980> go<00:04:04.100> with

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
running like leveling it as we go with

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.550 
running like leveling it as we go with
like<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.520> four<00:04:04.820> to<00:04:04.970> six<00:04:05.000> foot<00:04:05.300> level<00:04:05.630> okay<00:04:06.020> and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
like a four to six foot level okay and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.290 
like a four to six foot level okay and
you<00:04:06.710> can<00:04:06.860> check<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.100> with<00:04:07.370> laser<00:04:07.550> levels<00:04:08.000> you

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
you can check it with laser levels you

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.400 
you can check it with laser levels you
know<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:08.870> okay

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
know but okay

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.930 
know but okay
most<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.650> time<00:04:09.740> with<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.040> wall<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.340> size

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
most the time with the wall this size

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.510 
most the time with the wall this size
you<00:04:11.210> don't<00:04:11.360> need<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:12.260> laser<00:04:12.530> level<00:04:12.950> okay<00:04:13.280> well

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
you don't need the laser level okay well

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.440 
you don't need the laser level okay well
let's<00:04:13.640> go<00:04:13.730> over<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:13.940> take<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.090> look<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.360> see

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
let's go over and take a look and see

sure and you backfill the block as you
go<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:38.810> uh<00:04:38.840> since<00:04:39.500> each<00:04:39.770> block<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.190> stacked

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
go but uh since each block is stacked

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.790 
go but uh since each block is stacked
behind<00:04:40.730> each<00:04:41.060> other<00:04:41.270> once<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.350> get<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:42.650> high
