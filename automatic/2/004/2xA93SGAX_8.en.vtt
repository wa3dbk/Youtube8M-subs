00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
lot the tank tread is actually 100%

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.700 
lot the tank tread is actually 100%
plastic<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.969> make<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> yourself<00:00:42.710> it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
plastic you make it yourself it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.630 
plastic you make it yourself it
occasionally<00:00:44.250> tends<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.730> pop<00:00:44.910> loose

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
occasionally tends to pop loose

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.830 
occasionally tends to pop loose
especially<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:48.059> you're<00:00:48.180> moving<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> tank

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
especially when you're moving the tank

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.590 
especially when you're moving the tank
treads<00:00:49.110> around<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> lot<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
treads around you get a lot of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
treads around you get a lot of
flexibility<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> catch<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
flexibility out of it but the catch is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
flexibility out of it but the catch is
it's<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.270> flexible<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.840> sometimes<00:00:55.230> tends<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's so flexible it sometimes tends to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
it's so flexible it sometimes tends to
pop<00:00:55.710> loose<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.820> should

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
pop loose I kind of think they should

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.849 
pop loose I kind of think they should
have<00:00:57.059> gone<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.480> gave<00:00:57.899> us<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.140> ready-made

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
have gone and just gave us a ready-made

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.650 
have gone and just gave us a ready-made
tank<00:00:59.340> tread<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.789> yeah<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.070> see

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
tank tread but yeah but as you can see

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
tank tread but yeah but as you can see
all<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.110> tank<00:01:04.320> treads<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.070> two

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
all the tank treads here are on two

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.830 
all the tank treads here are on two
plates<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> use<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.600> four

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
plates you're going to use all but four

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.760 
plates you're going to use all but four
of<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:08.420> but<00:01:09.420> that's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.900> big<00:01:10.439> issue

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of them but that's not a big issue

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
of them but that's not a big issue
because<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> done<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> often<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.450> do

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.440 
darker than that but to turn on the LED
light<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> eject<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450

finger in there it's a bit of a paint
but<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:51.299> kit<00:01:51.540> does<00:01:51.570> come<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.049> core

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
but this kit does come with a core

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
but this kit does come with a core
fighter<00:01:52.409> pretty<00:01:53.100> much<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> exact<00:01:53.579> same<00:01:53.610> core

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
fighter pretty much the exact same core

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
fighter pretty much the exact same core
fighter<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> Erik<00:01:55.049> 78<00:01:55.409> -<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.860> version

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
fighter from the Erik 78 - to version

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.389 
fighter from the Erik 78 - to version
2.0<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.090> interchangeable<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:59.250> get

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
2.0 so they are interchangeable you get

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.209 
2.0 so they are interchangeable you get
a<00:01:59.430> yellow<00:01:59.729> pilot<00:02:00.060> instead<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> white<00:02:00.540> one

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
a yellow pilot instead of a white one

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.469 
a yellow pilot instead of a white one
but<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> detail<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.060> kit<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.360> really

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
but the detail on this kit is really

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
but the detail on this kit is really
high<00:02:03.780> look<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> spring

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
high look at this this is a spring

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
high look at this this is a spring
section<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.780> one<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> wheels<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
section from one of the wheels you get a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.859 
section from one of the wheels you get a
bunch<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
bunch of these and that is actually a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.830 
bunch of these and that is actually a
plastic<00:02:10.200> spring

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
plastic spring

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.390 
plastic spring
and<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.380> have<00:02:12.500> some<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> gun<00:02:13.040> barrels

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and they have some on the gun barrels

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.250 
and they have some on the gun barrels
too<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.370> there<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.360> see<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.660> tank<00:02:17.959> tread

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
too and there you see the tank tread

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.610 
too and there you see the tank tread
moving<00:02:20.080> originally<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.200> was<00:02:21.319> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.590> a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
moving originally this was going to be a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.350 
moving originally this was going to be a
remote-controlled<00:02:22.550> kit<00:02:22.819> eventually<00:02:23.209> that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
remote-controlled kit eventually that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.420 
remote-controlled kit eventually that
got<00:02:23.510> scrapped<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.100> became<00:02:25.280> an

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
got scrapped and it just became an

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.180 
got scrapped and it just became an
irregular<00:02:25.850> old<00:02:26.000> master<00:02:26.480> grade<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:29.800> now<00:02:30.800> for

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
irregular old master grade but now for

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.550 
irregular old master grade but now for
some<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.610> features<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:33.020> get<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> lot<00:02:33.470> of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
some of the features you get a lot of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.990 
some of the features you get a lot of
poseability<00:02:33.950> considering<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.640> thing<00:02:34.850> as<00:02:34.970> a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
poseability considering this thing as a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.460 
poseability considering this thing as a
tank<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.980> hips<00:02:37.819> or<00:02:38.120> waist<00:02:38.690> area<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.350> want

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
tank the hips or waist area if you want

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.130 
tank the hips or waist area if you want
to<00:02:39.530> call<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> lot<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.510> side-to-side

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
to call that get a lot of side-to-side

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.280 
to call that get a lot of side-to-side
forward<00:02:42.920> back<00:02:43.100> movement<00:02:43.780> even<00:02:44.780> with<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.080> core

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
forward back movement even with the core

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.780 
forward back movement even with the core
fighter<00:02:45.560> being<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:46.040> there<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.310> any<00:02:46.459> problem

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
fighter being in there that any problem

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.729 
fighter being in there that any problem
which<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.300> kind<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.570> surprising<00:02:47.690> there's<00:02:48.650> a

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
which is kind of surprising there's a

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.650 
which is kind of surprising there's a
lot<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.100> piston<00:02:49.610> action<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.300> on<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.540> this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
lot of piston action going on in this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.380 
lot of piston action going on in this
thing<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.550> when<00:02:52.550> you're<00:02:52.670> building<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.269> may

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
thing so when you're building it it may

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.910 
thing so when you're building it it may
not<00:02:53.540> make<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> whole<00:02:54.019> lot<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.200> sense<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:54.769> it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
not make a whole lot of sense but it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.380 
not make a whole lot of sense but it
will<00:02:55.580> make<00:02:55.790> sense<00:02:56.060> when<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.360> all<00:02:56.480> finished

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
will make sense when it's all finished

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.910 
will make sense when it's all finished
the<00:02:59.390> arms<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.959> get<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.110> whole<00:03:00.440> lot<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.680> pose

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the arms you get a whole lot of pose

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.380 
the arms you get a whole lot of pose
ability<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> bunch<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.790> ball<00:03:01.970> joints<00:03:02.300> in

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
ability on a bunch of ball joints in

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.009 
ability on a bunch of ball joints in
there<00:03:02.769> 360<00:03:03.769> all<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.950> way<00:03:04.069> around<00:03:04.870> can<00:03:05.870> be<00:03:05.900> a

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
there 360 all the way around can be a

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.270 
there 360 all the way around can be a
little<00:03:06.290> stiff<00:03:06.620> but<00:03:06.890> that's<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.100> good<00:03:07.220> thing

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
little stiff but that's a good thing

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.110 
little stiff but that's a good thing
actually<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.030> kit<00:03:09.640> there<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.850> little

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
actually on this kit there is a little

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.970 
actually on this kit there is a little
switching<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.930> wheels<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.560> will<00:03:12.650> change

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
switching the wheels that will change

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.490 
switching the wheels that will change
the<00:03:13.310> position<00:03:13.519> of<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.970> tank<00:03:14.180> tread<00:03:14.500> doesn't

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the position of the tank tread doesn't

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.699 
the position of the tank tread doesn't
change<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.769> whole<00:03:15.799> lot<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:18.110> nice<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.410> it's

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
change a whole lot it's nice that it's

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.069 
change a whole lot it's nice that it's
there<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.160> I'll<00:03:19.250> probably<00:03:19.400> never<00:03:19.579> use<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:20.079> you

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
there but I'll probably never use it you

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.900 
there but I'll probably never use it you
get<00:03:21.230> two<00:03:21.440> opening<00:03:21.829> panels<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.459> lower<00:03:22.610> part

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
get two opening panels on the lower part

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.009 
get two opening panels on the lower part
of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.000> kit<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:25.640> back<00:03:26.000> panel<00:03:26.360> here

of the kit you get this back panel here

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.590 
of the kit you get this back panel here
and<00:03:28.000> if<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.090> flip<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.299> around<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.660> front

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
and if you flip it around to the front

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.240 
and if you flip it around to the front
you<00:03:32.600> get<00:03:32.840> another<00:03:33.230> lower<00:03:33.620> panel<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.190> opens

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
you get another lower panel that opens

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.440 
you get another lower panel that opens
down<00:03:34.610> here

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.539 

also<00:03:41.450> have<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> neat<00:03:42.230> feature<00:03:42.469> I<00:03:42.650> had<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.189> glue

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
also have a neat feature I had to glue

surprising<00:03:57.560> feature<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:57.829> didn't<00:03:58.069> think<00:03:58.159> they

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
surprising feature I didn't think they

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.309 
surprising feature I didn't think they
do<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.819> is<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.599> can<00:03:59.750> move<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.049> tank

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
do on this is you can move the tank

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.140 
do on this is you can move the tank
treads<00:04:00.620> out<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.099> around<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.609> get<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> ton<00:04:02.120> of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
treads out and around you get a ton of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.229 
treads out and around you get a ton of
poseability<00:04:02.659> out<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.049> these<00:04:03.140> things<00:04:03.349> I

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
poseability out of these things I

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.179 
poseability out of these things I
figured<00:04:05.239> gun<00:04:05.750> tank<00:04:05.959> okay<00:04:06.439> it's<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.709> tank<00:04:07.010> you're

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
figured gun tank okay it's a tank you're

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.410 
figured gun tank okay it's a tank you're
not<00:04:07.310> going<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.489> get<00:04:07.579> a<00:04:07.609> whole<00:04:07.819> lot<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.030> poses

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
not going to get a whole lot of poses

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.569 
not going to get a whole lot of poses
especially<00:04:09.170> on<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.319> lower<00:04:09.500> half<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.010> this

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
especially on the lower half but this

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.979 
especially on the lower half but this
thing<00:04:10.790> very<00:04:10.819> surprised<00:04:11.359> me<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:11.569> got<00:04:11.719> a<00:04:11.750> lot

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
thing very surprised me it's got a lot

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.180 
thing very surprised me it's got a lot
more<00:04:12.019> pose<00:04:12.319> ability<00:04:12.620> than<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:12.829> would<00:04:12.950> think

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
more pose ability than you would think

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.650 

as<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.459> see<00:04:16.699> when<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.060> move<00:04:17.239> them<00:04:17.389> both

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
as you can see when you move them both

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.319 
as you can see when you move them both
sections<00:04:18.259> out<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:19.099> can<00:04:19.310> move<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.669> tank<00:04:20.120> up

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
sections out you can move the tank up

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.360 
sections out you can move the tank up
down<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.840> little<00:04:21.289> forward<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.829> get<00:04:21.949> a<00:04:21.979> lot<00:04:22.340> more

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
down a little forward you get a lot more

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.860 
down a little forward you get a lot more
poses<00:04:22.880> than<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.240> think<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.509> were<00:04:23.599> going<00:04:23.780> to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
poses than you think you were going to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.779 
poses than you think you were going to
out<00:04:24.080> of<00:04:24.169> this<00:04:24.289> kit<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.340> see<00:04:28.490> once<00:04:28.669> you

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
out of this kit and you see once you

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.040 
out of this kit and you see once you
move<00:04:28.940> them<00:04:29.090> both<00:04:29.240> out<00:04:29.449> you<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:29.810> lean<00:04:29.960> it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
move them both out you can lean it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.550 
move them both out you can lean it
forward<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.620> can<00:04:30.979> lean<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.250> back<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:33.410> get

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
forward you can lean it back and get

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.469 
forward you can lean it back and get
more<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.800> an<00:04:33.889> attack<00:04:34.190> pose<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:35.090> kind<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.270> hard

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
more of an attack pose it's kind of hard

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.740 
more of an attack pose it's kind of hard
to<00:04:35.539> make<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.810> gun<00:04:36.080> tank<00:04:36.380> look<00:04:36.590> menacing<00:04:37.160> but

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
to make the gun tank look menacing but

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.330 
to make the gun tank look menacing but
if<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.960> pose<00:04:39.199> it<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.470> right<00:04:39.650> way<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:40.160> can

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
if you pose it the right way you can

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.159 
if you pose it the right way you can
really<00:04:40.580> look<00:04:40.880> pretty<00:04:41.210> dangerous<00:04:44.169> dangerous

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169
