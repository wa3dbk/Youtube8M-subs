little<00:01:11.880> bit<00:01:12.470> too<00:01:13.470> high<00:01:14.150> but<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.810> little

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
little bit too high but it's a little

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.960 
little bit too high but it's a little
difficult<00:01:16.259> she<00:01:16.770> has<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.150> thyroid<00:01:18.150> problem<00:01:18.799> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it makes it real difficult for her to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
it makes it real difficult for her to
lose<00:01:22.740> ways<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.670> combined<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.210> her

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
lose ways that combined with her

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.800 
lose ways that combined with her
inability<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.640> real<00:01:27.600> active<00:01:29.450> she<00:01:30.450> should

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
inability to be a real active she should

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.910 
inability to be a real active she should
be<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.770> maybe<00:01:32.400> 10<00:01:32.909> 12<00:01:33.659> pounds<00:01:34.229> lighter<00:01:34.530> I'm

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920

thinking<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.939> least<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.840> vet

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
thinking at least that's what the vet

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
thinking at least that's what the vet
indicates<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> she<00:01:38.189> weighs<00:01:38.400> 98<00:01:38.970> pounds<00:01:39.299> right

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
indicates and she weighs 98 pounds right
