00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.590
 the purpose of this tutorial and to understand 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.250
 how to operate his joystick 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.230
 playstation 3 on his pc for that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 simple manipulations just 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 to install so it leads to playstation 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 So I 'm doing a brief summary for 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.539
 know how to do it quickly we go in 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.130
 bronze his throttle so preferably by 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.269
 cable about with the connection 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 bluetooth I will try to make a small 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.010
 tutorial a little bit later we go 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.730
 driver administration 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 we bring honda nahla to click on it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 does the other driver from there we're going to have 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 a list that will be displayed successfully 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.140
 this normally hopefully he'll 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 maybe ask us to restart it 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.410
 if it is, we restart and after 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 back on fast start 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 we will have here so choice so the first 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.469
 emanates and digital 1 will match man 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 playstation 1 his boss we 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.149
 interest the second controller to nano 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 analog one will match the m 2 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.200
 playstation 2 or 3 analog controller 2 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 ditto except we're going to have the triggers 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.790
 l2 and r2 who made me a trigger 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.490
 analog dx default it is by default 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.140
 a pc controller jean defect it's all 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.570
 an emulation so his xbox writings 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.600
 360 and custom default that's what will 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.909
 we are interested in the profile perso on 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.460
 go here and there we have a list of buttons 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.600
 we wonder what it's like 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 not very complicated in fact once 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.579
 we got the trick 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.350
 so we take the first four we do not 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.799
 do not touch them just go 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.689
 to invert is the r1 l2 r2 why 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.210
 because in games so especially 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the fps a little awkward because of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.920
 that the l1 and l2 are swapped 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.659
 as well as the ra and the r2 so even for 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.579
 amateurs fifa all that is not good 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.020
 convenient we can always edit in 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.759
 the games but they at least here it will be 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 does the configuration will match 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.259
 perfectly every time so we go 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 switch l1 into buttons this r1 into buttons 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.750
 8 n 2 in buttons 5 and r2 in buttons 6 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.030
 here I stay a little bit on the screen 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.310
 story that we can see the four there 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.690
 we will then go to the select button 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.819
 so this one is the button on off in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 we will not touch and earth to fire 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.310
 on the other hand l3 and start to avoid that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.470
 when you click on the left joystick 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.080
 safa arises in the game this is it 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.690
 better so we swap so l3 not 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.840
 become 11 button and start will become the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.470
 button 10 r3 meanwhile remains the button 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.650
 12 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.380
 we put button 12 the ps button this is the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.250
 button 13 will learn the debates so there 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.080
 just click on 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.690
 correspondences so says no serious says 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.239
 not dry of ipad in spas delev tu 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.830
 see there we will then interested so there 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.780
 you will not put a triangle circle on 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.489
 do not worry about it we do not put anything if there is 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.130
 things you click here you put 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.940
 fashion and it disappears we'll go 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.040
 now to the joystick 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.590
 so for the left joystick this is the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.560
 Levitic x plus we put x more until then 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.690
 nothing complicated ditto so x - one 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.989
 click home and axis x my best 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.569
 of Europe the part of which six at least 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.850
 more exactly then rights tic 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.860
 so that's more annoying especially 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.980
 for those who play games 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.570
 especially to force nobody like me 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.430
 I'm accusing I had the borderlands problem 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.320
 That is, when the character 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.230
 we start a part the characters 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.239
 rats because the sky and then turns to mr x 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.410
 more so that actually corresponds to the view 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.820
 and rex plus rx - ar y more air y me that 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.400
 actually allows us to move the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.989
 view from left to right and from top to bottom 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.390
 so we keep it really looking like expelled 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.290
 expo aired more with less and then in 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.850
 down so we'll see 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.950
 you may have things that 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.230
 appears here you put none of 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.000
 everywhere you need nothing here is here 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.480
 you put name from everywhere you do 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.720
 it changes and we start again on a departure 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.100
 fast in doubt one uses me and a 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.170
 little test of the vibration if we want 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.230
 enjoy 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.090
 free and hop we can start his game and 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.090
 it's all good here
