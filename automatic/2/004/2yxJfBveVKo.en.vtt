then<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.670> having<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.319> refreshed<00:03:13.319> and

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
then I'm having a refreshed and

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.690 
then I'm having a refreshed and
reinvigorated<00:03:15.209> Vincent<00:03:15.600> Kompany<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.700> think

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
reinvigorated Vincent Kompany I think

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.009 
reinvigorated Vincent Kompany I think
Gary<00:03:17.850> Cahill's<00:03:18.180> recently<00:03:18.660> covered<00:03:18.840> himself

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
Gary Cahill's recently covered himself

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.110 
Gary Cahill's recently covered himself
in<00:03:19.260> glory<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.160> would<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.850> concede

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
in glory but I would have to concede

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.240 
in glory but I would have to concede
that<00:03:21.329> companies<00:03:22.290> are<00:03:22.320> better<00:03:22.650> defender<00:03:23.070> Gary

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that companies are better defender Gary

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.490 
that companies are better defender Gary
Cahill<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.000> yeah<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.570> pulled<00:03:24.810> one<00:03:24.930> back<00:03:24.959> we've

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
Cahill so yeah you pulled one back we've

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.410 
Cahill so yeah you pulled one back we've
got<00:03:25.680> both<00:03:25.860> captains<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.640> there<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.090> now<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.269> go

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
got both captains in there so now we go

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.880 
got both captains in there so now we go
to<00:03:27.450> write<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.019> think<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.799> to

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
to write back I think this is going to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.280 
to write back I think this is going to
be<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.040> sticking<00:03:29.340> point<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.730> think<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:31.079> two

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
be the sticking point I think the two

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.170 
be the sticking point I think the two
best<00:03:31.530> right<00:03:31.709> backs<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.130> league<00:03:32.180> Ivanovic

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
best right backs in the league Ivanovic

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.670 
best right backs in the league Ivanovic
and<00:03:33.480> Zabaleta<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.519> think<00:03:35.910> they<00:03:36.090> both<00:03:36.680> mean

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and Zabaleta and I think they both mean

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.009 
and Zabaleta and I think they both mean
as<00:03:37.920> much<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.430> fans<00:03:38.730> into<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> team<00:03:39.420> as<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
as much to the fans into the team as the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.990 
as much to the fans into the team as the
others<00:03:40.290> are<00:03:40.500> Belarus<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.160> one<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.640> mr.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
others are Belarus is one of the mr.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.150 
others are Belarus is one of the mr.
cities<00:03:42.329> he<00:03:42.570> he<00:03:43.049> definitely<00:03:43.440> gets<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.950> he's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
cities he he definitely gets it he's

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.759 
cities he he definitely gets it he's
he's<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.820> man<00:03:45.060> communion<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:45.720> his<00:03:46.350> Avila<00:03:46.620> from

he's a man communion for his Avila from
Argentina<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.209> think<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.480> Van<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.840> she's

for a lot of stick but I think he's a
fantastic<00:04:08.130> player<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.700> think<00:04:08.880> he's<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.690> think

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
he's a class act I think that his all of

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.670 
he's a class act I think that his all of
all<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.600> things<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.959> can't<00:04:13.230> easily

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
all of the things that you can't easily

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.360 
all of the things that you can't easily

quantify fight heart passion you can't
you<00:04:17.489> know<00:04:17.579> that's<00:04:17.760> not<00:04:17.850> lots<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.209> stat<00:04:18.419> and

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
you know that's not lots of stat and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.690 
you know that's not lots of stat and
can't<00:04:18.780> do<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.049> he<00:04:19.769> displays<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.370> all<00:04:20.519> in

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
think Williams brilliant

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.910 
think Williams brilliant
and<00:06:41.280> massively<00:06:42.270> underrated<00:06:42.650> but<00:06:43.650> I'm

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
and massively underrated but I'm

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.650 
and massively underrated but I'm

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
thinking do we go 30 I don't know do we

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.990 
thinking do we go 30 I don't know do we
go<00:06:48.810> we<00:06:49.080> can<00:06:49.230> either<00:06:49.320> go<00:06:49.560> it's<00:06:49.830> up<00:06:49.950> to<00:06:50.100> you<00:06:50.280> if<00:06:50.520> we

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
go we can either go it's up to you if we

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.240 
go we can either go it's up to you if we
play<00:06:51.180> one<00:06:51.390> striker<00:06:51.950> it's<00:06:52.950> going<00:06:53.100> to<00:06:53.130> be<00:06:53.220> a

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
play one striker it's going to be a

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.960 
play one striker it's going to be a
Guerro<00:06:53.580> and<00:06:53.910> you<00:06:53.970> can<00:06:54.090> have<00:06:54.180> William<00:06:54.710> or<00:06:55.850> do<00:06:56.850> we

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
Guerro and you can have William or do we

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:03.280 
Guerro and you can have William or do we
play<00:06:57.770> hazard<00:06:58.820> Aguero<00:06:59.820> and<00:07:00.300> Kosta<00:07:01.020> up<00:07:01.650> front<00:07:02.010> I

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
play hazard Aguero and Kosta up front I

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.950 
play hazard Aguero and Kosta up front I
think<00:07:04.290> it's<00:07:04.380> for<00:07:04.530> the<00:07:04.590> balance<00:07:05.100> and<00:07:05.250> it<00:07:05.750> do<00:07:06.750> you

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
think it's for the balance and it do you

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.330 
think it's for the balance and it do you
know<00:07:07.080> what<00:07:07.260> this<00:07:07.380> is<00:07:07.440> this<00:07:07.830> is<00:07:07.950> comes

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
know what this is this is comes

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.670 
know what this is this is comes
unnaturally<00:07:08.880> to<00:07:09.030> me<00:07:09.150> but<00:07:09.450> I'm<00:07:09.600> such<00:07:10.530> an

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
unnaturally to me but I'm such an

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.550 
unnaturally to me but I'm such an
admirer<00:07:11.070> of<00:07:11.510> the<00:07:12.510> brilliance<00:07:12.990> of<00:07:13.140> Sergio

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
admirer of the brilliance of Sergio

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.140 
admirer of the brilliance of Sergio
Aguero<00:07:13.920> that<00:07:14.760> I<00:07:14.790> will<00:07:15.920> concede<00:07:16.920> Diego<00:07:17.910> Costa's

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
Aguero that I will concede Diego Costa's

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.720 
Aguero that I will concede Diego Costa's
position<00:07:18.720> to<00:07:18.810> you<00:07:18.930> and<00:07:19.280> therefore<00:07:20.280> give<00:07:20.520> go

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:20.730 
position to you and therefore give go

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.110 
position to you and therefore give go
for<00:07:20.940> William<00:07:21.180> so<00:07:22.280> no<00:07:23.280> I<00:07:23.310> think<00:07:23.580> you<00:07:23.970> are

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
for William so no I think you are

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.590 
for William so no I think you are
actually<00:07:24.300> winning<00:07:24.660> in<00:07:24.900> terms<00:07:25.140> of<00:07:25.260> numbers<00:07:25.620> I

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
actually winning in terms of numbers I

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.640 
actually winning in terms of numbers I
don't<00:07:27.600> know<00:07:27.690> how<00:07:27.750> quickly<00:07:28.020> did<00:07:28.230> because<00:07:28.500> we're

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
don't know how quickly did because we're

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.700 
don't know how quickly did because we're
champions<00:07:28.980> it's<00:07:29.310> it<00:07:29.970> might<00:07:30.120> be<00:07:30.270> but<00:07:30.710> either

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
champions it's it might be but either

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.760 
champions it's it might be but either
way<00:07:31.950> I<00:07:32.450> think<00:07:33.450> that's<00:07:33.810> a<00:07:34.020> scene<00:07:34.530> that<00:07:34.650> would

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770 
way I think that's a scene that would

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.010 
way I think that's a scene that would
walk<00:07:35.100> the<00:07:35.430> Premier<00:07:35.730> League<00:07:35.760> if<00:07:36.030> at<00:07:36.630> senior

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
walk the Premier League if at senior
