inch<00:00:25.189> got<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> lot<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.369> 2<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.880> two-inch<00:00:27.390> PVC

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
inch got a lot of 2 is here two-inch PVC

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
inch got a lot of 2 is here two-inch PVC
poles<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.420> should<00:00:30.720> hold<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.170> place<00:00:31.759> as

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
poles so that should hold it in place as

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340 
poles so that should hold it in place as
long<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> kids<00:00:33.420> don't<00:00:33.690> knock<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> poles

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
long as the kids don't knock the poles

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.549 
long as the kids don't knock the poles
out<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.980> suppose<00:00:35.489> we'll<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.850> okay<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> can

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
out I suppose we'll be okay now you can

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.639 
out I suppose we'll be okay now you can
see<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> water<00:00:38.450> is<00:00:39.450> being<00:00:39.719> pumped<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
see the water is being pumped from this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.750 
see the water is being pumped from this
20<00:00:41.040> gallon<00:00:41.399> tank<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> heater<00:00:42.989> hose<00:00:43.309> up<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
20 gallon tank to a heater hose up to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.779 
20 gallon tank to a heater hose up to
the<00:00:44.910> top<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> collector<00:00:46.610> right<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.760> here

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the top of the collector right up here

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
the top of the collector right up here
and<00:00:48.530> from<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.670> water<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.879> distributed<00:00:51.530> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and from here water is distributed to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430 
and from here water is distributed to
three<00:00:52.800> collectors<00:00:53.730> now<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.629> could<00:00:54.899> also<00:00:55.079> have

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
three collectors now we could also have

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.220 
three collectors now we could also have
33<00:00:56.129> collectors<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.000> i<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.170> could

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
33 collectors but i don't think i could

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.590 
33 collectors but i don't think i could
fit<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.039> van<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.910> don't<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
fit them in my van and I don't have the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.290 
fit them in my van and I don't have the
time<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.870> build<00:01:01.230> them<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.770> anyway

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
time to build them right now anyway

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.850 
time to build them right now anyway
anyway<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.740> water<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
anyway so this is where the water is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.140 
anyway so this is where the water is
distributed<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> collectors<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> top

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
distributed to the collectors at the top

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.960 
distributed to the collectors at the top
and<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.540> being<00:01:12.780> pumped<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> pump<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and it's being pumped now the pump is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.270 
and it's being pumped now the pump is
not<00:01:15.030> powered<00:01:15.720> by<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> battery<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> battery

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
not powered by the battery the battery

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.280 
not powered by the battery the battery
is<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.060> buffer<00:01:18.720> between<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> Sun<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
is just a buffer between the Sun and the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
is just a buffer between the Sun and the
pump<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.840> sort<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> moderates<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.820> power

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
pump it sort of moderates the the power

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
pump it sort of moderates the the power
swing<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.939> power<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.450> generated<00:01:31.049> by<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.389 
volts now the open the non load voltage
from<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> photovoltaic<00:01:49.290> panel<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.040> actually

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
from the photovoltaic panel is actually

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.679 
from the photovoltaic panel is actually
19<00:01:50.670> volts<00:01:52.460> as<00:01:53.460> soon<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.119> connect<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
19 volts as soon as you connect that to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.219 
19 volts as soon as you connect that to
the<00:01:55.939> pump<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.149> voltage<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> course<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> going

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the pump the voltage of course is going

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.130 
the pump the voltage of course is going
to<00:01:58.320> drop<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.579> sometimes<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.360> erratic

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to drop but sometimes it's very erratic

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.170 
to drop but sometimes it's very erratic
when<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.000> Sun<00:02:03.000> dump<00:02:03.530> jumps<00:02:04.759> goes<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> out

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
when the Sun dump jumps goes in and out

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.550 
when the Sun dump jumps goes in and out
of<00:02:06.240> clouds<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.729> voltage<00:02:09.090> should<00:02:09.410> jumps<00:02:10.410> up

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
of clouds the voltage should jumps up

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
of clouds the voltage should jumps up
and<00:02:10.679> down<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> best

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and down and that's not the best

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.190 
and down and that's not the best
in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> world<00:02:12.690> through<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> pump<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
in the world through the pump so the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.370 
in the world through the pump so the
