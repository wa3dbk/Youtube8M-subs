00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
out of 225 and these two really like the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
out of 225 and these two really like the
design<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
design and this one is actually like a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.959 
design and this one is actually like a
patch<00:00:56.600> two<00:00:57.600> colors<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.250> two

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
patch two colors there and then two

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.500 
patch two colors there and then two
colors<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> top<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.609> it's<00:01:02.609> uh<00:01:02.850> i<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
colors on the top and it's uh i think is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.010 
colors on the top and it's uh i think is
rookie<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.580> year<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.720> should<00:01:06.930> have

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
rookie of the year so it should have

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
rookie of the year so it should have
been<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.250> game<00:01:08.250> used<00:01:08.520> jersey<00:01:08.700> worn<00:01:10.820> during<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
been a game used jersey worn during the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
been a game used jersey worn during the
year<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:13.020> Rookie<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> Year<00:01:13.470> number<00:01:13.950> 37

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
year he got Rookie of the Year number 37

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
out of a hundred and I guess 1992 in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
out of a hundred and I guess 1992 in
1993<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> same<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.250> Kevin<00:01:20.670> Durant<00:01:20.790> should<00:01:21.360> be

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
1993 and same for Kevin Durant should be

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.980 
1993 and same for Kevin Durant should be
triple<00:01:22.140> jersey<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:23.310> he<00:01:23.520> wore<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> year<00:01:24.810> he

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
triple jersey that he wore the year he

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.660

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
got rookie of the year which is 07 08

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.660 
got rookie of the year which is 07 08
and<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.509> number<00:01:27.890> 253<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.490> hundred

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and this was number 253 out of a hundred

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.530 
and this was number 253 out of a hundred
so<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.130> fun<00:01:32.130> pick<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.579> probably

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
didn't get a very good deal on that but

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.319

of absolute don't think there's really a
pattern<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> try<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> check<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.159> form<00:01:44.430> but

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
pattern to try to check some form but

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.450 
pattern to try to check some form but

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I heard someone told me that the last

I heard someone told me that the last
three<00:02:17.580> boxes<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:18.120> every<00:02:18.750> case<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.740> case

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
three boxes of every case is the case

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.460 
three boxes of every case is the case
hit<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.850> i<00:02:21.330> had<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.410> pay<00:02:22.530> double<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.220> price<00:02:24.470> by

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
hit so i had to pay double the price by

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.860 
hit so i had to pay double the price by
me<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.130> fair<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.460> because<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.420> mean<00:02:27.690> we

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
me it's fair just because I mean we

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.900 
me it's fair just because I mean we
bought<00:02:28.080> these<00:02:28.290> two<00:02:28.470> boxes<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.580> rest<00:02:29.760> of

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
bought these two boxes so the rest of

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
bought these two boxes so the rest of
the<00:02:30.000> 12<00:02:30.270> boxes<00:02:30.420> means<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.110> pretty<00:02:31.380> much<00:02:31.560> like

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the 12 boxes means is pretty much like

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.450 
the 12 boxes means is pretty much like
just<00:02:32.490> junk<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> mean<00:02:33.500> he'll<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
just junk so I mean he'll have to be the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.100 
just junk so I mean he'll have to be the
one<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.700> try<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> sell<00:02:36.330> those<00:02:36.510> he<00:02:36.960> had

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
one that try to sell those he had

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.620 
one that try to sell those he had
another<00:02:37.410> case<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.310> tried<00:02:39.000> buying<00:02:39.330> those

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
another case and I tried buying those

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.080 
another case and I tried buying those
but<00:02:39.900> he<00:02:39.990> said<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.470> he<00:02:41.040> will<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.760> able<00:02:41.910> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
but he said that he will not be able to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
but he said that he will not be able to
do<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.480> anymore<00:02:42.690> from<00:02:43.560> now<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.920> wherever<00:02:44.160> he

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
do it anymore from now on wherever he

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610 
do it anymore from now on wherever he
opens<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.760> case<00:02:45.000> all<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.930> boxes<00:02:46.290> will<00:02:46.500> be

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
opens the case all the boxes will be

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.850 
opens the case all the boxes will be
shuffled<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:48.030> sold<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.500> will<00:02:49.710> be

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
shuffled and then sold so this will be

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.340 
shuffled and then sold so this will be
this<00:02:50.310> will<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.700> think<00:02:50.870> probably<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.080> last

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
this will be I think probably the last

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.820 
this will be I think probably the last
group<00:02:52.770> rig<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.190> could<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.850> these<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:55.200> guess<00:02:55.800> so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
group rig I could do of these I guess so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.880 
group rig I could do of these I guess so
called<00:02:56.430> hot<00:02:56.730> boxes<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.420> almost<00:02:57.750> guaranteed<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
called hot boxes so almost guaranteed to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.480 
called hot boxes so almost guaranteed to
have<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.270> case<00:03:00.510> hit<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.020> don't<00:03:01.740> sue<00:03:01.980> me<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.190> it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
have the case hit but don't sue me if it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.550 
have the case hit but don't sue me if it
doesn't<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:02.970> case<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.750> mean<00:03:04.200> just

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
doesn't have the case it but I mean just

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.440 
doesn't have the case it but I mean just
from<00:03:05.190> our<00:03:05.460> personal<00:03:06.360> experience<00:03:06.990> it's<00:03:07.890> gonna

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
from our personal experience it's gonna

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.920 
from our personal experience it's gonna
just<00:03:09.450> kind<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> how<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.770> in<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.160> past<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870

removed<00:03:45.650> me<00:03:46.250> just<00:03:46.489> moving<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:46.879> still<00:03:47.120> for<00:03:48.019> a

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
removed me just moving is still for a

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.050 
removed me just moving is still for a
good<00:03:48.200> amount<00:03:48.230> number<00:03:49.190> one<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:49.489> one<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.910> that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
good amount number one on one and that

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.650 
good amount number one on one and that
was<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:50.299> when<00:03:51.110> we<00:03:51.260> pulled<00:03:51.730> from<00:03:52.730> our<00:03:53.000> only<00:03:53.269> six

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
was so when we pulled from our only six

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.750 
was so when we pulled from our only six
boxes<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.799> was<00:03:54.950> from<00:03:55.129> the<00:03:55.250> bottom<00:03:55.549> three

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
boxes but it was from the bottom three

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.119 
boxes but it was from the bottom three
that<00:03:56.030> was<00:03:56.239> pulled<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.349> third<00:03:57.590> definitely

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
that was pulled so the third definitely

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.699 
that was pulled so the third definitely
holds<00:03:58.340> true<00:03:58.519> him<00:03:58.640> from<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:58.910> same<00:03:59.319> box<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.560> mean

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
holds true him from the same box I mean

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.860 
holds true him from the same box I mean
it<00:04:00.830> was<00:04:00.920> like<00:04:01.069> during<00:04:01.730> William<00:04:02.180> duel<00:04:02.450> Jersey

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
it was like during William duel Jersey

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.500 
it was like during William duel Jersey
auto<00:04:03.019> all<00:04:03.650> kinds<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.099> their<00:04:04.250> stuff<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:04.700> I<00:04:04.910> mean

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
auto all kinds of their stuff so I mean

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.500 
auto all kinds of their stuff so I mean
so<00:04:05.810> these<00:04:06.019> have<00:04:06.260> really<00:04:06.560> high<00:04:06.890> potential

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
so these have really high potential

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.150 
so these have really high potential
again<00:04:08.510> I'm<00:04:08.840> not<00:04:08.870> going<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.410> be<00:04:09.530> able<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.890> get

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
again I'm not going to be able to get

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.979 
again I'm not going to be able to get
any<00:04:10.340> more<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:10.880> this<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.299> probably<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.810> last

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
any more so this is probably the last

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.160 
any more so this is probably the last
time<00:04:12.319> I<00:04:12.560> will<00:04:12.769> be<00:04:12.890> able<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.160> do<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:14.170> I'm

expensive for not too many boxes but I
mean<00:04:37.850> still<00:04:38.150> cheaper<00:04:38.479> than<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.690> half<00:04:39.289> case<00:04:39.620> of

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
mean still cheaper than a half case of

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.350 
mean still cheaper than a half case of
absolute<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:41.270> mean<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:43.430> do<00:04:43.910> if<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.240> do

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
absolute and I mean and you do if you do

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120 
absolute and I mean and you do if you do
a<00:04:44.389> half<00:04:44.600> case<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:44.930> won't<00:04:45.080> be<00:04:45.169> going<00:04:45.289> to<00:04:45.530> kc<00:04:45.800> and

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
a half case you won't be going to kc and

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.279 
a half case you won't be going to kc and
we're<00:04:46.520> almost<00:04:46.700> like<00:04:47.030> very<00:04:47.630> likely<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.110> get

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 
high potential and these four boxes I

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.580 
high potential and these four boxes I
grabbed<00:07:09.950> from<00:07:10.250> a<00:07:10.310> sealed<00:07:10.850> case<00:07:11.240> so<00:07:11.990> these<00:07:12.320> have
