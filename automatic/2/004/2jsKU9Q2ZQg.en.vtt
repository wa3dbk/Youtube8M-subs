from prior rain boot experience I've

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.270 
from prior rain boot experience I've
always<00:00:54.199> thought<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.410> rain<00:00:54.680> boots<00:00:54.860> as<00:00:55.100> being

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
always thought of rain boots as being

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.250 
always thought of rain boots as being
functional<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.300> not<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:56.660> comfortable<00:00:57.140> when

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
I'm impressed with baffan for creating a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.100 
I'm impressed with baffan for creating a
boot<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:02.000> allows<00:01:02.300> motion<00:01:02.870> through<00:01:03.079> the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
boot that allows motion through the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.689 
boot that allows motion through the
ankles<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:03.800> you're<00:01:04.009> able<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:04.519> walk

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
ankles so that you're able to walk

when gardening and easily get up and

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.680 
when gardening and easily get up and
down<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.890> stairs<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.940> one<00:01:14.090> thing<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.509> did

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
down the stairs the one thing I did

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.570 
down the stairs the one thing I did
notice<00:01:14.899> is<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.500> tighter<00:01:15.740> fit<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.310> very

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
notice is the tighter fit of the very

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.419 
notice is the tighter fit of the very
top<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.270> boot<00:01:17.450> on<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.960> calf<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.250> good

top of the boot on the calf this is good

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.070 
top of the boot on the calf this is good

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
because the boots stay up but it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.990 
because the boots stay up but it
wouldn't<00:01:21.380> hurt<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.590> measure<00:01:21.979> your<00:01:22.250> calf<00:01:22.490> prior
