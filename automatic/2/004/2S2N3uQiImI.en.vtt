00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
because the repackaging came in straight

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.750

is a really good play on this game and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.420 
is a really good play on this game and
that<00:00:56.200> means<00:00:56.410> we<00:00:56.500> only<00:00:56.530> have<00:00:56.710> one<00:00:56.770> right<00:00:57.280> back

stage<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.770> we<00:00:59.890> also<00:00:59.980> get<00:01:00.219> rid<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.370> upgrading

key<00:01:53.859> but<00:01:54.039> i<00:01:54.159> think<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.700> was<00:01:54.789> Marchetti<00:01:55.299> if<00:01:55.840> I'm

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
key but i think it was Marchetti if I'm

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.529 
key but i think it was Marchetti if I'm
correct<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:56.649> Papiss<00:01:57.639> Cisse<00:01:57.669> shows<00:01:58.149> like<00:01:58.299> very
