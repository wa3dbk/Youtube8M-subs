 the sun there and be welcome is one more 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 episode because it 's easy 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.670
 the program we talked several curiosities 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 of the pokémon world 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.109
 I'm from there and I'm going to talk about the subject today. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.830
 image has been detained since I created the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.750
 Last 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 the reason why china has no 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.599
 girlfriend why do you like 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.179
 along your journey or you have had 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.090
 several companies 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.620
 Loved the dom aires and at the moment the scene 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 however will not get involved 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
 romantically with none of them 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.690
 there are several reasons why 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 to have happened 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.770
 one of them is the fact that the protagonist of the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.660
 movie to be only temporary 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.180
 as a rule it is always that steel travels to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.160
 another region your partner changes with 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 exception of mystic played evil therefore 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.520
 Sewer 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.989
 for this reason it would be difficult to 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.180
 relationship with any of your 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 because eventually they have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.230
 They were going to wait to 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.539
 next protagonist in the anime scene 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 explains pikachu's dobashi was already sad 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 imagine how much there is a separation 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.760
 would be mainly a program 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 intended for an audience as young as 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.110
 Pokemon certainly does not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.020
 would be able to understand the nature of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.210
 the relationship or the reason for its 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 one of the possible reasons is the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.110
 spend every moment every day 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 next to your travel companions 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 that see me the other side of that person 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 which side in the private moment that due to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.090
 constant proximity to a journey 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 implies becoming impossible or hiding 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.310
 and with the exception of the scene practically doing 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.020
 in all episodes some of the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.479
 ashram pretty companions 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 aggressive as my aunt Iris who 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 were clearly lacking in 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.009
 maturity coming to have manifestations 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.149
 physical 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.310
 she is much more she arrives she does not have to 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:57.020
 stay and study 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.020
 The table mage did not take the team b 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.389
 [Music] 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.070
 or more on different like mayer dom 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.080
 we can not forget that the only 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.180
 The cleanest example coachee had was the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.070
 Drill rejected or indirectly and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.930
 not speak with a girl with 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.540
 witnessed it is possible that I think 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.270
 that associating with the same happened 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.040
 however the most likely reason I think 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 they do not understand is a relationship 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.240
 love was never confirmed if the father 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.459
 astro was present in his childhood 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.900
 have disappeared later or never 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.940
 had for example all 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.650
 in any way it is almost certain that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.270
 I think he did not have a father figure with 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.520
 who could learn to interact with the 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.739
 the opposite sex to what she could teach 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.989
 relation to the idea of ​​attraction in 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.970
 boys usually starts between the 10th and 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.440
 the 11 years of data being 11 years of 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.459
 most common age to have this type of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.410
 behaviors 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.580
 so it is quite possible that I think 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 has not yet begun its 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.640
 sexual maturity 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.770
 combining this with the fact the West see in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.730
 world there are monsters of the powers 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.560
 extraordinary 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.480
 it is also possible that your journey is 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.580
 enough distraction for him to ignore 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.350
 possible attractions 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.209
 one of the tests of the instrument is 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.090
 present in the event encourages the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.739
 ghost of the stinger zela in episode is 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.290
 of all the men who seal the cell 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.180
 madly fell in love with her every 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.010
 men who pass by here I fell was not 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.239
 This is always the same story 25 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.019
 we find here as a zombie without 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.080
 vital energy announces how stupid it is 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.700
 the work of the maiden's ghost yet 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.799
 opposite of the twin block 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.600
 steel is not affected despite 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.850
 clearly seen from the sky as long as 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560
 the block can prove that your body does not 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.260
 produces the hormones necessary to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.870
 express this kind of feeling and pro 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.780
 pt was met because the so 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.640
 to be released already know is in the video not 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.620
 forget to leave it there and do not 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.989
 subscribing to the channel costs nothing 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.030
 even helping a lot can leave the 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.799
 our suggestions for the name of the future is 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.630

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.510
 some people said that it was a 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:14.920
 twisted little trick that did not fit 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.810
 mother why would it be doing this is enough 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.639
 Simple but I think I 'll even go there.
