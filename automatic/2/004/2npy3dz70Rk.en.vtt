00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
different levels that you see in here

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.340 
different levels that you see in here
the<00:00:52.520> blue<00:00:52.700> on<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.940> top<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:54.050> kind<00:00:54.260> of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
the blue on the top and the kind of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.470 
the blue on the top and the kind of
clearish<00:00:54.950> white<00:00:55.280> towards<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.760> bottom<00:00:55.910> our

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
clearish white towards the bottom our

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.360 
clearish white towards the bottom our
two<00:00:56.750> different<00:00:57.080> levels<00:00:57.200> to<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.800> top<00:00:58.040> part

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
two different levels to it the top part

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.070 
two different levels to it the top part
actually<00:00:58.550> burns<00:00:58.970> off<00:00:59.240> initially<00:00:59.600> when<00:00:59.960> you're

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
actually burns off initially when you're

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.330 
actually burns off initially when you're
using<00:01:00.290> whatever<00:01:00.560> heat<00:01:00.860> appliance<00:01:01.250> you're

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
using whatever heat appliance you're

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.650 
using whatever heat appliance you're
using<00:01:01.490> whether<00:01:01.670> it's<00:01:01.880> your<00:01:02.000> blow-dryer<00:01:02.420> your

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
using whether it's your blow-dryer your

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.329 
using whether it's your blow-dryer your
curling<00:01:02.990> iron<00:01:03.050> or<00:01:03.170> whatever<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.070> bottom

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
curling iron or whatever and the bottom

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.859 
curling iron or whatever and the bottom
part<00:01:04.489> has<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> polymer<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.329> helps<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.750> absorb

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
part has a polymer that helps to absorb

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.260 
part has a polymer that helps to absorb
some<00:01:06.439> of<00:01:06.469> the<00:01:06.649> heat<00:01:06.890> energy<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.000> you're

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
some of the heat energy so you're

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.459 
some of the heat energy so you're
getting<00:01:08.359> two<00:01:08.659> different<00:01:08.960> types<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.289> heat

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
getting two different types of heat

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.319 
getting two different types of heat
protection<00:01:09.859> into<00:01:10.219> it<00:01:10.340> there's<00:01:10.700> also<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.060> slight

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
protection into it there's also a slight

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.910 
protection into it there's also a slight
bit<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.539> styling<00:01:11.869> agent<00:01:12.170> into<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:12.710> helps

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
bit of styling agent into it so it helps

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.219 
bit of styling agent into it so it helps
to<00:01:13.009> give<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.189> a<00:01:13.250> little<00:01:13.369> bit<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.609> control<00:01:14.229> you

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
to give you a little bit of control you

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.340 
to give you a little bit of control you
shake<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.679> activate<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.899> a<00:01:17.990> very<00:01:18.020> light

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
shake to activate and it's a very light

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.520 
shake to activate and it's a very light
mist<00:01:18.590> once<00:01:19.219> it's<00:01:19.369> primed<00:01:19.670> there<00:01:20.149> we<00:01:20.240> go<00:01:20.530> and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
mist once it's primed there we go and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.749 
mist once it's primed there we go and
you<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:21.859> see<00:01:22.039> how<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.249> just<00:01:22.429> kind<00:01:22.549> of<00:01:22.579> goes

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
you can see how it just kind of goes

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.279 
you can see how it just kind of goes
over<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.060> top<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.359> it<00:01:23.450> we<00:01:23.630> misted<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.049> on<00:01:24.170> her

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
over the top of it we misted that on her

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.069 
over the top of it we misted that on her
hair<00:01:24.560> when<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:24.890> was<00:01:25.039> damp<00:01:25.609> I<00:01:25.880> use<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.659> blow<00:01:27.049> dryer

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
hair when it was damp I use a blow dryer

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.109
