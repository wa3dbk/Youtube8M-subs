with<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.829> walk<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> ocean<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
with it or walk into the ocean with it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
with it or walk into the ocean with it
it's<00:01:30.360> happened<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> everyone<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.259> that's<00:01:31.350> why

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's happened to everyone and that's why

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
it's happened to everyone and that's why
I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> such<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> great<00:01:32.670> feature<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I think this is such a great feature to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
I think this is such a great feature to
have<00:01:33.150> once<00:01:33.869> you've<00:01:34.020> completely<00:01:34.380> thrown<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
have once you've completely thrown a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.710 
have once you've completely thrown a
phone<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> pool<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.610> poured<00:01:36.180> practically

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
phone into a pool and poured practically

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630

a<00:01:36.750> whole<00:01:36.990> gallon<00:01:37.380> jug<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> water<00:01:37.890> onto<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.460> it's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
a whole gallon jug of water onto it it's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
a whole gallon jug of water onto it it's
tough<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> device<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.049> lacks

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
tough to want to use a device that lacks

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
tough to want to use a device that lacks
waterproof<00:01:40.829> functionality<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
waterproof functionality because of this

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
waterproof functionality because of this
I'm<00:01:42.479> looking<00:01:42.570> forward<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> Xperia<00:01:43.740> z2

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
I'm looking forward to the Xperia z2

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
I'm looking forward to the Xperia z2
because<00:01:44.579> according<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.000> Sony<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.630> actually

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
because according to Sony it's actually

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.719 
because according to Sony it's actually
more<00:01:46.110> resistant<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.740> water<00:01:46.890> than<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> Galaxy

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
more resistant to water than the Galaxy

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060 
more resistant to water than the Galaxy
s5<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.869> my<00:01:49.049> opinion<00:01:49.259> waterproof<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
s5 so my opinion waterproof and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.069 
s5 so my opinion waterproof and
dustproof<00:01:50.369> capabilities<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.570> definitely

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
dustproof capabilities are definitely

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
dustproof capabilities are definitely
the<00:01:52.200> future<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.710> smartphones<00:01:53.280> another<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the future of smartphones another one of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.999 
the future of smartphones another one of
my<00:01:54.540> favorite<00:01:54.840> features<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> fingerprint

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
my favorite features is the fingerprint

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
my favorite features is the fingerprint
scanner<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.149> didn't<00:01:57.390> already<00:01:57.509> know

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
scanner and if you didn't already know

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.929 
scanner and if you didn't already know
the<00:01:57.930> galaxy<00:01:58.170> s5<00:01:58.590> actually<00:01:59.040> has<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> fingerprint

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the galaxy s5 actually has a fingerprint

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
the galaxy s5 actually has a fingerprint
sensor<00:02:00.060> built<00:02:00.420> into<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.840> home<00:02:01.079> button<00:02:01.380> like

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
sensor built into the home button like

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.190

on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> iPhone<00:02:02.189> 5s<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.909> yes<00:02:03.329> Apple<00:02:03.750> did<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
on the iPhone 5s and yes Apple did do it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
on the iPhone 5s and yes Apple did do it
first<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.950> shouldn't<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
complete war going on in the comment

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
complete war going on in the comment
section<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:07.979> video<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.390> me<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
section of this video and to me the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
section of this video and to me the
whole<00:02:09.959> concept<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.530> protecting<00:02:11.069> passwords

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
whole concept of protecting passwords

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.610 
whole concept of protecting passwords
and<00:02:11.730> accounts<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.209> fingerprint<00:02:12.660> sensors

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and accounts with fingerprint sensors

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470 
and accounts with fingerprint sensors
are<00:02:13.680> actually<00:02:13.830> pretty<00:02:14.489> cool<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:15.420> now

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
are actually pretty cool as of right now

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.940 
are actually pretty cool as of right now
you<00:02:15.629> can<00:02:15.870> actually<00:02:16.080> send<00:02:16.470> payments<00:02:16.860> over

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you can actually send payments over

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
you can actually send payments over
PayPal<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.730> verify<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.239> your<00:02:18.269> fingerprint

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
PayPal and verify with your fingerprint

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
PayPal and verify with your fingerprint
so<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> technology<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.010> definitely<00:02:20.459> evolving

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
so the technology is definitely evolving

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.309 
so the technology is definitely evolving
and<00:02:21.209> once<00:02:21.480> everything<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.900> completely

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
and once everything is completely

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.869 
and once everything is completely
protected<00:02:22.830> using<00:02:22.980> fingerprint<00:02:23.580> technology

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
protected using fingerprint technology

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.030 
protected using fingerprint technology
life<00:02:24.629> will<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.080> much<00:02:25.140> easier<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.769> needing

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
life will be so much easier not needing

solve this issue by registering the side

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.650 
solve this issue by registering the side

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
probably my fault because I'm always

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.490 
probably my fault because I'm always

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
just about the sweet spot for overall

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.000 
just about the sweet spot for overall

last year during the Galaxy s4 launch
but<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:20.890> isn't<00:05:21.190> just<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.460> software<00:05:21.850> that

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
but it isn't just the software that

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.190 
but it isn't just the software that
makes<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.300> camera<00:05:22.630> one<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.960> major

makes the camera one of the major
improvements<00:05:23.860> over<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.070> s4<00:05:24.700> it's<00:05:25.330> also<00:05:25.630> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
improvements over the s4 it's also the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.810 
improvements over the s4 it's also the
hardware<00:05:26.160> Samsung<00:05:27.160> actually<00:05:27.280> claims<00:05:27.700> that

hardware Samsung actually claims that

hardware Samsung actually claims that
the<00:05:27.940> s5<00:05:28.390> can<00:05:28.630> take<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:28.840> picture<00:05:29.140> in<00:05:29.500> around<00:05:29.740> 0.3

the s5 can take a picture in around 0.3

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.850 
the s5 can take a picture in around 0.3
seconds<00:05:30.700> which<00:05:31.240> is<00:05:31.450> pretty<00:05:31.750> impressive<00:05:32.080> even

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
seconds which is pretty impressive even

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.320 
seconds which is pretty impressive even
though<00:05:33.160> we<00:05:33.280> weren't<00:05:33.490> able<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.730> test<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.150> out

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
though we weren't able to test this out

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.540 
though we weren't able to test this out
specifically<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.380> found<00:05:35.920> it<00:05:36.040> took<00:05:36.160> pictures

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
specifically I found it took pictures

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.090 
specifically I found it took pictures
pretty<00:05:36.850> darn<00:05:37.060> fast<00:05:37.240> without<00:05:37.540> any<00:05:37.900> blur<00:05:38.200> also

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
pretty darn fast without any blur also

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.250 
pretty darn fast without any blur also
the<00:05:39.280> upgrade<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.760> a<00:05:39.790> 16<00:05:40.300> megapixel<00:05:40.390> camera<00:05:41.140> is

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
the upgrade to a 16 megapixel camera is

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.080 
the upgrade to a 16 megapixel camera is
a<00:05:41.290> pretty<00:05:41.680> big<00:05:41.860> deal<00:05:42.040> when<00:05:42.370> cropping<00:05:42.730> pictures

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
a pretty big deal when cropping pictures

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.580 
a pretty big deal when cropping pictures
and<00:05:43.330> bringing<00:05:43.600> them<00:05:43.720> up<00:05:43.840> on<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.140> computer

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
and bringing them up on the computer

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.680 
and bringing them up on the computer
they<00:05:45.250> show<00:05:45.430> up<00:05:45.490> sharper<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.210> cleaner<00:05:46.419> than

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
they show up sharper and cleaner than

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.900 
they show up sharper and cleaner than
phones<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.230> HTC<00:05:47.410> One<00:05:47.950> m8<00:05:48.160> which<00:05:48.700> only

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
phones like the HTC One m8 which only

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.270 
phones like the HTC One m8 which only
has<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.150> four<00:05:49.300> megapixel<00:05:50.020> camera<00:05:50.410> another<00:05:51.040> one

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
has a four megapixel camera another one

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.500 
has a four megapixel camera another one
of<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.430> major<00:05:51.669> improvements<00:05:51.970> is<00:05:52.390> the

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
of the major improvements is the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.300 
of the major improvements is the
implementation<00:05:53.290> of<00:05:53.440> 4k<00:05:53.890> video<00:05:54.160> recording

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
implementation of 4k video recording

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.030 
implementation of 4k video recording
which<00:05:55.120> is<00:05:55.360> pretty<00:05:55.600> awesome<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:56.470> only<00:05:56.710> problem

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
which is pretty awesome the only problem
