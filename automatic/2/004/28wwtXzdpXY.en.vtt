00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.220 

ok<00:00:08.430> guys<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:09.060> basically<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:09.690> I've<00:00:09.780> done<00:00:09.960> is

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
ok guys so basically what I've done is

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830 
ok guys so basically what I've done is
I've<00:00:10.380> mounted<00:00:10.620> 8<00:00:11.190> turrets<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> back<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.450> my

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
I've mounted 8 turrets to the back of my

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.910 
I've mounted 8 turrets to the back of my
ear<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.469> pulse<00:00:13.830> ship<00:00:14.450> it's<00:00:15.450> simple<00:00:16.439> off<00:00:16.740> of

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
ear I in pulse ship it's simple off of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.850 
ear I in pulse ship it's simple off of
this<00:00:17.099> sort<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.630> pulse<00:00:18.630> enhancer<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
this sort of pulse enhancer which I

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.060 
this sort of pulse enhancer which I
figured<00:00:20.160> out<00:00:20.279> I've<00:00:21.090> made<00:00:21.360> a<00:00:21.420> block<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
figured out I've made a block with a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.720 
figured out I've made a block with a
bunch<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.820> power<00:00:24.110> ok<00:00:25.340> going<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> way<00:00:26.699> back

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
bunch of power ok going all the way back

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
bunch of power ok going all the way back
and<00:00:27.330> then<00:00:27.600> these<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> three<00:00:28.470> enhancers

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and then these are the three enhancers

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.659 
and then these are the three enhancers
only<00:00:29.430> doing<00:00:29.699> length<00:00:30.350> for<00:00:31.350> each<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.710> these<00:00:31.890> so

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
only doing length for each of these so

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
only doing length for each of these so
it's<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.970> lengths<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.540> has<00:00:33.660> been<00:00:33.840> in

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it's just lengths which has been in

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810 
it's just lengths which has been in
hands<00:00:34.199> right<00:00:34.769> no<00:00:35.010> no<00:00:35.129> it<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> look<00:00:35.699> at

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
hands right no no it can have a look at

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.790 
hands right no no it can have a look at
the<00:00:35.910> docking<00:00:36.239> box<00:00:36.480> there's<00:00:37.019> the<00:00:37.170> docking<00:00:37.590> for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the docking box there's the docking for

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.880 
the docking box there's the docking for
that<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> boxes<00:00:40.199> are<00:00:40.229> bugged<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.710> at

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that one and the boxes are bugged out at

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.649 
that one and the boxes are bugged out at
the<00:00:40.979> moment<00:00:41.159> but<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.269> they<00:00:42.420> fit

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
the moment but you can see that they fit

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.829 
the moment but you can see that they fit
in<00:00:42.839> the<00:00:42.989> space<00:00:43.879> maybe<00:00:44.879> oh<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.390> poked<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
in the space maybe oh they poked out a

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.410 
in the space maybe oh they poked out a
little<00:00:46.080> bit<00:00:46.290> but<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:47.699> allowed<00:00:47.940> me<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.239> dock

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
little bit but it allowed me to dock

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.329 
little bit but it allowed me to dock
them<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.049> they're<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.799> mounted

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
them and they're actually mounted

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.180 
them and they're actually mounted
correctly<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.970> time<00:00:51.269> think<00:00:52.080> I<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:53.100> know

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
correctly this time think I don't know

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.890 
correctly this time think I don't know
they're<00:00:53.430> mounted<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> inside<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:54.780> they

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
they're mounted on the inside when they

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.250 
they're mounted on the inside when they
should<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.140> hey<00:00:56.839> something's<00:00:57.839> going<00:00:58.110> on<00:00:58.199> with

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
should be hey something's going on with

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.939 
should be hey something's going on with
the<00:00:58.790> docking<00:00:59.790> but<00:01:00.059> hey<00:01:00.659> it's<00:01:01.350> fine<00:01:01.650> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the docking but hey it's fine and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
the docking but hey it's fine and
obviously<00:01:02.580> they<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:02.970> count<00:01:03.239> towards<00:01:03.659> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
obviously they don't count towards the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
obviously they don't count towards the
mass<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.440> thing<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
mass so this thing can really go and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.609 
mass so this thing can really go and
i'll<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.420> doing<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:06.960> testing<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
i'll be doing some more testing on this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.060 
i'll be doing some more testing on this
later<00:01:08.479> welcome<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.720> today<00:01:10.320> i'm<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> be

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
later welcome back today i'm going to be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
later welcome back today i'm going to be
reviewing<00:01:11.420> my<00:01:12.420> progress<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.649> pulse

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
reviewing my progress with the pulse

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.569 
reviewing my progress with the pulse
ship<00:01:14.219> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.329> pulse<00:01:15.600> pillar<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.399> can

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
ship this is the pulse pillar as you can

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.249 
ship this is the pulse pillar as you can
see<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.420> front<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.899> hang<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
see right now we're in front of hang and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
see right now we're in front of hang and
why<00:01:19.640> i'm<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.149> start<00:01:21.450> recording

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
why i'm just going to start recording

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.889 
why i'm just going to start recording
the<00:01:22.049> other<00:01:22.170> angle<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.829> can<00:01:23.070> cut<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.429> that

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
the other angle so you can cut to that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.889 
the other angle so you can cut to that
yeah<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:25.549> like<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.609> say<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> rotates<00:01:27.420> around<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
yeah so like I say it rotates around the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.800 
yeah so like I say it rotates around the
middle<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.590> real<00:01:28.890> fast<00:01:29.219> turning<00:01:30.149> ships<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
middle some real fast turning ships and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.410 
middle some real fast turning ships and
a<00:01:30.840> guy<00:01:30.960> 111<00:01:31.829> blocks<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.909> reason<00:01:33.299> you're

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
a guy 111 blocks the reason you're

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.090 
a guy 111 blocks the reason you're
seeing<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> boxes<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.679> is<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> known

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
seeing the boxes out here is a known

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.789 
seeing the boxes out here is a known
issue<00:01:35.130> which<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.999> fixed<00:01:36.210> soon<00:01:36.359> I'm<00:01:36.719> sure

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
issue which will be fixed soon I'm sure

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.840 
issue which will be fixed soon I'm sure
just<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.299> fact<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> re<00:01:40.549> has<00:01:41.549> just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just like a fact that the a re has just

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.279 
just like a fact that the a re has just
been<00:01:41.999> fixed<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.570> we're<00:01:42.719> just<00:01:42.749> going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> go<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
been fixed so we're just going to go and

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.599 
been fixed so we're just going to go and
check<00:01:43.499> with<00:01:43.679> these<00:01:43.829> turrets<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.429> little

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
check with these turrets a little

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.959 
check with these turrets a little
shooting<00:01:45.890> yep<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> main<00:01:47.280> difference<00:01:47.310> between

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
shooting yep the main difference between

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.260 
shooting yep the main difference between
this<00:01:48.359> she<00:01:48.689> house<00:01:48.840> fixtures<00:01:49.649> yeah<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.119> last

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this she house fixtures yeah but last

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.419 
this she house fixtures yeah but last
last<00:01:52.460> ship<00:01:53.460> had<00:01:53.670> drones<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.189> sort<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
last ship had drones and I just sort of

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.160 
last ship had drones and I just sort of
went<00:01:56.609> back<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.119> drawing<00:01:57.270> board<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> ended

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
went back to the drawing board and ended

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.899 
went back to the drawing board and ended
up<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.130> more<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.789> lot

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

and<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.610> yeah<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:04.009> think<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.220> first<00:02:05.430> thing<00:02:05.580> I'm

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and so yeah I think the first thing I'm

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.779 
and so yeah I think the first thing I'm
going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.150> do<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.799> into<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
going to actually do is get into a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.370 
going to actually do is get into a
surfboard<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:10.110> film<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.830> moving<00:02:11.370> along<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
surfboard of film it moving along and I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.640 
surfboard of film it moving along and I
can<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.709> speed<00:02:14.510> well<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.959> I'm<00:02:16.140> sat<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.500> front

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
can get a speed well so I'm sat in front

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.490 
can get a speed well so I'm sat in front
and<00:02:16.800> hang<00:02:17.010> them<00:02:17.130> high<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.170> imagine<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> my

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and hang them high and imagine you my

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.530 
and hang them high and imagine you my
surfboard<00:02:19.739> I'm<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.610> try<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:20.850> fly<00:02:21.270> along

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
surfboard I'm going to try and fly along

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.420 
surfboard I'm going to try and fly along
next<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.170> thing<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.680> how<00:02:22.860> fast<00:02:23.190> it's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
next to this thing and see how fast it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.070 
next to this thing and see how fast it's
going<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.090> we're<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.480> start<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.840> pulse

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
going so we're going to start the pulse

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.470 
going so we're going to start the pulse
Oh<00:02:26.690> off<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> goes<00:02:28.880> check<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.000> everyone<00:02:30.120> wait

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
Oh off it goes check with everyone wait

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.550 
Oh off it goes check with everyone wait
okay<00:02:31.170> I'm<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.410> pulsing<00:02:31.950> oh<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:33.480> oh<00:02:33.690> no<00:02:34.170> no<00:02:34.380> no

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
okay I'm not pulsing oh what oh no no no

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
okay I'm not pulsing oh what oh no no no
no<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.250> yeah<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.910> like<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.480> real

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
no that's like yeah that's like the real

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.750 
no that's like yeah that's like the real
ships<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.170> here<00:02:37.410> okay<00:02:39.110> right<00:02:40.110> then<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:40.769> yeah

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
ships up here okay right then so yeah

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.699 
ships up here okay right then so yeah
it's<00:02:41.970> got<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> much<00:02:42.569> better<00:02:42.810> acceleration<00:02:43.200> in

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it's got a much better acceleration in

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.830 
it's got a much better acceleration in
the<00:02:43.769> last<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.489> let's<00:02:44.610> go<00:02:44.910> see<00:02:45.720> what

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the last one so let's go see what

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.789 
the last one so let's go see what
speeders<00:02:46.319> speed<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.459> 12.5<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
speeders speed is 12.5 going for the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.970 
speeders speed is 12.5 going for the
continuous<00:02:50.400> pulse<00:02:52.459> speed<00:02:53.459> test<00:02:54.890> way<00:02:55.890> met

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
continuous pulse speed test way met

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.460 
continuous pulse speed test way met
Oh<00:02:57.040> off<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.239> goes<00:02:58.269> all<00:02:58.959> right<00:02:59.080> here<00:02:59.349> we<00:02:59.379> go

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
Oh off it goes all right here we go

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.920 
Oh off it goes all right here we go
right<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:00.900> hit<00:03:01.900> 80<00:03:02.739> oh<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.780> it's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
right it's it's hit 80 oh and it's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.720 
right it's it's hit 80 oh and it's
pulsed<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.739> 100

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
pulsed to 100

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.500 
pulsed to 100
Oh<00:03:08.500> God<00:03:09.500> yeah<00:03:09.860> right<00:03:10.220> well<00:03:10.580> trying<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.330> keep

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
Oh God yeah right well trying to keep

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.670 
Oh God yeah right well trying to keep
this<00:03:11.629> in<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.930> shot<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:13.720> mm-hmm<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:15.470> really

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
this in a shot here mm-hmm it's really

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.500 
this in a shot here mm-hmm it's really
difficult<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.250> control<00:03:16.549> two<00:03:16.819> ships<00:03:17.150> at<00:03:17.299> once

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
difficult to control two ships at once

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.610 
difficult to control two ships at once
that's<00:03:17.840> all<00:03:17.930> I'm<00:03:18.110> gonna<00:03:18.230> say<00:03:18.349> oh<00:03:18.860> yes<00:03:20.620> yeah

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
that's all I'm gonna say oh yes yeah

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.339 
that's all I'm gonna say oh yes yeah
it's<00:03:21.799> at<00:03:21.950> max<00:03:22.159> speed<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:23.000> slows<00:03:23.450> down<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:24.080> about

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
it's at max speed it slows down to about

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.089 
it's at max speed it slows down to about
well<00:03:25.190> I've<00:03:25.519> lost<00:03:25.819> him<00:03:26.349> where<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.440> go<00:03:27.590> there<00:03:27.950> he

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
well I've lost him where you go there he

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.630 
well I've lost him where you go there he
is<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:29.330> slows<00:03:29.629> down<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:30.170> about<00:03:30.410> 100<00:03:31.129> and<00:03:31.280> then

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
is it slows down to about 100 and then

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.830 
is it slows down to about 100 and then
it<00:03:31.790> accelerates<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:34.209> really<00:03:35.209> hundreds<00:03:35.660> out

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
it accelerates to really hundreds out

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.089 
it accelerates to really hundreds out
bad<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:37.069> doing<00:03:37.370> max<00:03:37.610> speed<00:03:37.909> now<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:39.099> not

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
bad it's doing max speed now it's not

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.680 
bad it's doing max speed now it's not
slowing<00:03:40.340> down<00:03:40.579> at<00:03:40.819> all<00:03:41.000> it's<00:03:41.269> basically

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
slowing down at all it's basically

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.400 
slowing down at all it's basically
pulses<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.680> looks<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.690> hard<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.049> keep<00:03:45.200> up<00:03:45.349> with

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
pulses and looks so hard to keep up with

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.920 
pulses and looks so hard to keep up with
xing<00:03:45.950> keeps<00:03:46.819> dropping<00:03:47.060> all<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.420> its<00:03:47.629> things

goes and it is going in a kit is going

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.970 
goes and it is going in a kit is going
in<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.269> straight<00:03:56.329> line<00:03:56.569> it's<00:03:57.079> just<00:03:57.140> rotating<00:03:57.890> I

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
in a straight line it's just rotating I

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.770 
in a straight line it's just rotating I
need<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:58.190> get<00:03:58.310> closer<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.849> it<00:04:01.480> all<00:04:02.480> right<00:04:02.599> each

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
need to get closer to it all right each

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.140 
need to get closer to it all right each
other's<00:04:03.049> having<00:04:03.290> connection<00:04:03.739> problems<00:04:04.150> here

other's having connection problems here
we<00:04:05.269> go<00:04:05.480> oh<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> looks<00:04:07.519> like<00:04:07.609> lagging<00:04:08.329> it's

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
we go oh so it looks like lagging it's

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.150 
we go oh so it looks like lagging it's
like<00:04:08.989> it's<00:04:09.170> lagging<00:04:09.440> occasionally<00:04:10.040> be

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
like it's lagging occasionally be

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.030 
like it's lagging occasionally be
someone's<00:04:10.489> trying<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.760> connect<00:04:11.090> Oh<00:04:12.040> looks

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
someone's trying to connect Oh looks

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.229 
someone's trying to connect Oh looks
like<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.280> sound<00:04:13.400> connection<00:04:13.880> problems

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
like you sound connection problems

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.050 
like you sound connection problems
because<00:04:14.419> it<00:04:14.540> keeps<00:04:14.630> dropping<00:04:14.900> out<00:04:15.940> well<00:04:16.940> this

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
because it keeps dropping out well this

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.659 
because it keeps dropping out well this
is<00:04:17.090> beautiful<00:04:17.810> it's<00:04:18.799> it's<00:04:19.250> actually

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
modular design you've got with it I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.800 
modular design you've got with it I
really<00:04:33.289> wanted<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:34.060> that's<00:04:35.060> inspiring<00:04:35.570> me<00:04:35.780> to
