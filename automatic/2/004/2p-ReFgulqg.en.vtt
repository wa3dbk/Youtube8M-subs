00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello world or often ask me 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.349
 what did i do face care and sewed 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.610
 show you how i put on a mask 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:19.490
 the artists are moisturizing and this dark through 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.490
 day you need to wet your face 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.789
 and face 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 write 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.909
 That area where we will put a mask 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:47.750
 Next, take the mask itself. 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.750
 cheek and chin tax 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:58.860
 and stripes and begin disassembly 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.040
 evenly patting movements or 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.830
 masks namely, its claping not and therefore 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.050
 that the subject is bad and we are going to tighten 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 even my cream is applied only 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.380
 patting movements otherwise you 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380
 stretch your stake on 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.689
 as we know around the eyes we do not cause 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.380
 cream mask because it is harmful it 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.630
 too low on the area is not always the way 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.100
 add more and more 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.100
 the mask is my trunk 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.370
 I am always better to add more 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.530
 now let me advise you to apply as 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.700
 you can often like a mask because it 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.880
 very useful 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 face
