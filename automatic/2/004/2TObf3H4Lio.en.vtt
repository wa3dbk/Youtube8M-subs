now basically was something wrong with

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.480 
now basically was something wrong with
my<00:00:27.990> processor<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.650> thought<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.010> video<00:00:29.310> card

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
my processor I thought was my video card

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.919 
my processor I thought was my video card
I<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.000> computer<00:00:30.119> checked<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
I got my computer checked out was the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.179 
I got my computer checked out was the
processor<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.769> replace<00:00:32.009> my

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
processor so I had to replace my

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.650 
processor so I had to replace my
processor<00:00:33.829> yeah<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.390> brutal

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
processor yeah so that was pretty brutal

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.030 
processor yeah so that was pretty brutal
like<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> wouldn't<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> battle<00:00:37.739> reports

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
like I wouldn't like the battle reports

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
like I wouldn't like the battle reports
I<00:00:38.160> had<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> break<00:00:38.550> them<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.790> into<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.149> parts

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
I had to break them up into two parts

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.200 
I had to break them up into two parts
because<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.100> didn't<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.489> straight<00:00:41.820> part<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
because if I didn't one straight part it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
because if I didn't one straight part it
would<00:00:42.300> take<00:00:42.540> between<00:00:42.719> 25<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> 30<00:00:43.890> hours<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
would take between 25 to 30 hours to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.160 
would take between 25 to 30 hours to
render<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.149> video<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.730> crazy<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> had<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
render a video it was crazy so I had to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170 
render a video it was crazy so I had to
do<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> apologize<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:51.000> I'm

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
huge thank you to everyone out there for
supporting<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.159> patreon<00:01:38.520> account<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:40.020> reason

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
supporting my patreon account the reason

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.330 
supporting my patreon account the reason
why<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> free<00:01:40.740> channel<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.130> course

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
why this is the free channel of course

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.819 
why this is the free channel of course
is<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:42.150> many<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> people<00:01:43.530> support<00:01:43.770> my

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
is because many of the people support my

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.350 
is because many of the people support my
patreon<00:01:44.130> account<00:01:44.159> aren't<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.850> pets<00:01:45.090> because

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
patreon account aren't or pets because

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.990 
patreon account aren't or pets because
they're<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.689> countries<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
they're in countries that don't have it
