bit shallow but you know the very least
you<00:01:43.170> could<00:01:43.439> lock<00:01:44.009> them<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> wanted<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you could lock them in if you wanted to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.870 
you could lock them in if you wanted to
when<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> need<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> tripod<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.369> also<00:01:47.490> throw<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
when I need a tripod I can also throw it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.749 
when I need a tripod I can also throw it
in<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> seems<00:01:48.630> mighty<00:01:49.140> wide<00:01:50.100> from<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
in here it seems mighty wide from one of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.010 
in here it seems mighty wide from one of
the<00:01:50.939> small<00:01:51.450> travel<00:01:51.960> tripod<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> let's<00:01:54.750> look<00:01:54.899> at

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the small travel tripod so let's look at

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
the small travel tripod so let's look at
the<00:01:55.080> top<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:56.340> top<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.000> another<00:01:57.240> couple

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the top the top and another couple

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.859 
the top the top and another couple
straps<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.259> me<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.590> hangs<00:01:58.830> on<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.869> we

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
straps for me to have hangs on to and we

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.929 
straps for me to have hangs on to and we
got<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.289> section<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.610> looks<00:02:02.820> like

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
got one section here that looks like

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.649 
got one section here that looks like
it's<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.500> throwing<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.009> foam<00:02:05.789> keys<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it's just for throwing in foam keys you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.300 
it's just for throwing in foam keys you
know<00:02:06.750> small<00:02:07.289> things<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.770> need<00:02:08.039> easy

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
know small things that I need easy

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.229 
know small things that I need easy
access<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:10.229> there's<00:02:10.619> another<00:02:10.860> pocket

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
access to and there's another pocket

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.960 
access to and there's another pocket
right<00:02:12.239> over<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:14.040> surprisingly

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
right over here that is surprisingly

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.979 
right over here that is surprisingly
large<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.830> falls<00:02:17.069> out<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.810> see

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
large and falls out so you can see

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.990 
large and falls out so you can see
actually<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.069> actually<00:02:20.340> where<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.519> key

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
actually so this is actually where a key

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.500 
actually so this is actually where a key
could<00:02:21.239> go<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.780> has<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:23.030> anchor<00:02:24.030> point

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
could go it has a little anchor point

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.479 
could go it has a little anchor point
for<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.810> little<00:02:25.350> mesh<00:02:25.620> pocket<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.370> have

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
for that little mesh pocket for you have

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.309 
for that little mesh pocket for you have
a<00:02:26.519> lot<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> things<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:28.170> has<00:02:28.290> a

you<00:03:09.630> got<00:03:09.750> some<00:03:09.930> plastic<00:03:10.260> ones<00:03:10.410> here<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:11.010> a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
you got some plastic ones here it's a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
you got some plastic ones here it's a
metal<00:03:11.310> ones<00:03:11.489> here<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.000> guess<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.329> can<00:03:12.480> know

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.319 
metal ones here so I guess you can know
by<00:03:12.780> touch<00:03:12.989> by<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:14.160> seeing<00:03:14.459> them<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.209> know

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
by touch by not seeing them I can I know

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.970 
by touch by not seeing them I can I know
which<00:03:15.569> one<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:16.140> opening<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:17.690> as<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:19.739> open<00:03:19.920> up

the bag it has even more storage under
the<00:03:22.650> top<00:03:23.340> frame<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.500> stretchy<00:03:25.500> mesh

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
the top frame this is a stretchy mesh

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.490 
the top frame this is a stretchy mesh
material<00:03:26.100> which<00:03:26.730> I'm<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.239> sure<00:03:27.540> what<00:03:27.810> they

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
material which I'm not sure what they

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.590 
material which I'm not sure what they
built<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.889> for<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:29.519> it's<00:03:29.670> interesting<00:03:30.209> it's

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
built that for but it's interesting it's

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.030 
built that for but it's interesting it's
kind<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.079> dry<00:03:31.709> fit<00:03:31.920> tech<00:03:32.100> material

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
kind of like a dry fit tech material

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.030 
kind of like a dry fit tech material
throw<00:03:34.730> something<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.920> then<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.010> have

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
throw something in there then you have

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.530 
throw something in there then you have
