00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.000
 we will now see the viewfinder a 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.490
 'point hunter so a ' point is a 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.990
 Swedish company rather specialized in 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.029
 moving products so the 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.369
 military sights the shooting optics a 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.869
 military but she has a very big 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.610
 hunting department which is now on 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.390
 is starting to be well known and especially 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.770
 with viewfinders without correction of 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.260
 parallax so that allow a shot of 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.890
 beat 1-6 beat ordinary aix who have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.000
 makes their reputation 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.130
 so we will see a declination 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.480
 specific that had appeared there are two 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.510
 three years now and who is the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.239
 inter benoÃ®t version of the good side 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.000
 christophe games so shame tip this is 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.920
 really last the last born of 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 leading models so the moderators 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.050
 which declines here as well in 30 mm 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.780
 when 37 mm so there is the 34 course 34 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.039
 long 30 lessons 30 we just knew 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.660
 play on the length but at the exit 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.030
 the result will be the same a red dot 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.879
 a size of 2 and - 2 minutes of angle to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.400
 100 m are sights are set to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.680
 digitally more - one presses second 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.260
 to light it we adjust the intensity 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.479
 strong depending on the brightness of the sun or 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.960
 weak late in the day and for 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.329
 turn it off 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.820
 we press two seconds on the least one 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.500
 word maybe of autonomy then are 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.060
 obvious that are self-sustaining for five 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.040
 years five years that he leaves to him but you 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.700
 come back from a hunting party to be there 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.590
 will stay on for five years 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.420
 So here is an enormous autonomy them 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.450
 they are guaranteed 10 years you are ultra 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.950
 reliable and accurate with this tool 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.539
 is the pure there you know it's 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.539
 exceptional it's really very good 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.770
 we can say a word of the word without 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.899
 count the mount in the viewfinder alone 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.850
 then in the range is in enter on 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.799
 turns around 2 195 g 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.469
 we will go lower on the model 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.670
 micro after that are are tools that 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.840
 are very light so they can be 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 mounted on any rifle well 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.609
 sure because today I find 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.170
 parcels in 34 and 32 everywhere and for 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.409
 finish the price range roughly for 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.209
 fix the spirits in america is going too 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.170
 used around 6 199 euros 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.579
 ttc 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920
 taste buds here if you want 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.900
 succeed beat this season you 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.600
 know finally you have one of the keys the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.819
 solution a viewfinder and punk 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.819
