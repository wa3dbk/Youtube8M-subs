00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.879
 [Music] 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.550
 Y 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.799
 once we have all the points that 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.230
 We need in the needle pass it on to the 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.599
 left hand and we hold the needle that 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.970
 is empty with the right just like 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.500
 we did before putting it at the height of 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.720
 the chair 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.820
 we take with the right hand the thread that 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.460
 comes from the ball of wool and we start 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.010
 we weave the needle of the hand 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 right inside the first point 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.160
 passing the low test of the needle that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.160
 we have in the left hand 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.510
 ah 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 here you see how a needle goes under 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.540
 of the other being both inside the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 same point now we pass the thread of the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.780
 ball around the needle from below 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.960
 down up 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.960
 [Music] 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.189
 now we have to take out the needle from the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.480
 right bringing the ring with us 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.720
 what we just did 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.370
 [Music] 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.930
 and the point with which we were 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:27.020
 working we took it out of the needle 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.390
 [Music] 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.159
 we are going to repeat this process for 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 every point until we finish the 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:44.380
 previous return 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:47.380
 [Music] 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 i 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:03:00.580
 [Music] 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 ah 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.030
 once we have finished it and already 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.930
 we have all the points in the other 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.190
 needle we change hands again 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.440
 putting the ones that have the points in the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.450
 left hand and the one that is free in the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.760
 right and we repeat the process again 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.599
 exactly the same until we have the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.599
 long desired 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.099
 as you take practice 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.240
 It will be more comfortable to take wool 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:59.130
 a certain way I take it like that 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.130
 but there are a thousand different methods 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:05:04.389
 to 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:05:07.389
 [Music] 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.389
 i 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.410
 the result of always doing the 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.430
 turns with right points you will 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.430
 llama punto bobo 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.770
 and it stays that way 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.939
 [Music] 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.300
 is a point that is very chubby and very 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.480
 elastic and above all it is very easy to 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.480
 do 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:50.239
 I only have to explain how 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.610
 take the points once you have 

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:53.570
 finished 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.670
 do not miss the next video
