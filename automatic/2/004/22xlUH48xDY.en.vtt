00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and now it's pretty easy for Chris to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.520 
and now it's pretty easy for Chris to
complete<00:01:44.750> his<00:01:45.050> objective<00:01:46.750> now<00:01:47.750> Jen's<00:01:48.380> going

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.300 
complete his objective now Jen's going
to<00:01:48.590> take<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> little<00:01:48.890> bit<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.280> different

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
to take a little bit of a different

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.530 
to take a little bit of a different
approach<00:01:49.760> she's<00:01:49.970> going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.150> try<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.450> do

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
approach she's going to try and do

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.920 
approach she's going to try and do
everything<00:01:50.660> around<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.650> perimeter<00:01:52.130> covert

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.820 

first<00:01:56.930> thing<00:01:57.110> she's<00:01:57.260> going<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.470> try<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.740> do

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
first thing she's going to try and do

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.370 
first thing she's going to try and do
here<00:01:58.040> is<00:01:58.280> take<00:01:58.610> out<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.300> AAA<00:01:59.479> from<00:01:59.930> a<00:02:00.020> distance

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
here is take out the AAA from a distance

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.830 
here is take out the AAA from a distance
now<00:02:01.130> jen<00:02:01.400> has<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.940> her<00:02:02.060> possession<00:02:02.210> and

anti-material<00:02:03.500> rifle<00:02:03.800> which<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.400> kind<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.760> a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
anti-material rifle which is kind of a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.270 
anti-material rifle which is kind of a
really<00:02:05.270> amped<00:02:05.780> up<00:02:05.900> sniper<00:02:06.440> rifle<00:02:06.860> which<00:02:07.130> is

really amped up sniper rifle which is
kind<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.580> overkill<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.450> case<00:02:08.690> but<00:02:09.050> you

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
kind of overkill for this case but you

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.510 
kind of overkill for this case but you
know<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.890> mercenary<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.550> it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.980 

so<00:02:17.520> she's<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:17.940> try<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.150> come<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> good

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
so she's going to try and come to a good

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.309 
so she's going to try and come to a good
position<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:19.950> she<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.550> shoot<00:02:21.270> at<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.599> a

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
position so that she can shoot at that a

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.800 
position so that she can shoot at that a
a<00:02:22.500> unit<00:02:23.130> from<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.459> distance

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.690 

and<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.650> go<00:02:30.739> from<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.010> long-range<00:02:31.340> boom

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and there we go from a long-range boom

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.760 
and there we go from a long-range boom
that<00:02:31.970> guy's<00:02:32.120> gone<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.660> now<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.410> taken

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
that guy's gone so now the a is taken

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.100 
that guy's gone so now the a is taken
care<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.599> don't<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.900> worry

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
care of and now we don't have to worry

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.780
