00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 good afternoon in the last video we were preparing 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.980
 bran unleavened bread in a slow cooker 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.009
 today we will knead the dough for this bread 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.520
 manually we need activated 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.430
 sourdough bran flour sugar salt 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.609
 butter and water 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:30.880
 kneading dough will be a big pot 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:33.880
 sift add salt 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 sugar 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.670
 if we used sourdough dry 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.890
 yeast to it now, and we also added 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 Now rewrite all add makes it difficult 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 pour water 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.840
 add leaven 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.590
 melt butter for this 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.910

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.210
 add melted butter and 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.210
 we start to mix 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.100
 we mix our circular movements 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.100
 this 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:40.780
 continue to knead the dough until we 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.780
 not get a homogeneous ball 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.439
 in five minutes we have the dough ready 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.380
 warm up the slow cooker for two 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.689
 minutes in frying mode 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.689
 so put the dough in a heated multicooker 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.229
 set the baking mode with a delay on
