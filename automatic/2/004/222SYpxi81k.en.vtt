00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.060
 We use the steel ring of the flower shop 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 Use food glue brush 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.300
 We shaped the spadix (the yellow part of the flower) 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.900
 We check if it is appropriate by comparing it to the flower template. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.640
 The syrup must be so thin that you can see the texture of the marble below. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 We use venom templates to make flowers more realistic. 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.240
 Now we use the ball tool to cut the edges. 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.940
 This cone helps us shape the flowers 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.460
 Now we glue hard parts and always use food glue 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.420
 We use a flower ribbon to apply steel wire to the steel ring. 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.920
 Brush with food coloring 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.480
