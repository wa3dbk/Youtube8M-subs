didn't<00:01:11.979> know<00:01:12.100> it'd<00:01:12.159> work<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.610> went<00:01:12.850> like<00:01:13.030> crazy

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
didn't know it'd work it went like crazy

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.260 
didn't know it'd work it went like crazy
and<00:01:14.290> everything<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.740> very<00:01:14.890> hard<00:01:15.399> when<00:01:16.090> you're

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
and everything is very hard when you're

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.090 
and everything is very hard when you're
on<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.570> obstacle<00:01:17.050> course<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.470> would<00:01:17.560> used<00:01:17.830> so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
on the obstacle course it would used so

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.380 
on the obstacle course it would used so
hard<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.399> control<00:01:18.670> because<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.090> would<00:01:19.180> always

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
hard to control because it would always

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.450 
hard to control because it would always
like<00:01:19.630> crashing<00:01:20.229> you'd<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.590> stop<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.220> fan

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
like crashing you'd have to stop the fan

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.359 
like crashing you'd have to stop the fan
and<00:01:21.820> turn<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:23.170> someone<00:01:23.530> had<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:23.770> turn<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.039> for

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
and turn and someone had to turn to for

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.430 
and turn and someone had to turn to for
you<00:01:24.610> you're<00:01:25.270> used<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.600> always<00:01:25.810> crashing

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
you you're used to always crashing

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.090 
you you're used to always crashing
everything<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.869> didn't<00:01:29.259> go<00:01:29.410> really<00:01:29.649> straight

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
everything it didn't go really straight

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.330 
everything it didn't go really straight
it<00:01:30.250> was<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.880> was<00:01:31.060> very<00:01:31.360> hard<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.780> control

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
it was it was very hard to control

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.969 
it was it was very hard to control
that's<00:01:33.340> odd<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.850> that's<00:01:34.060> on<00:01:34.360> all<00:01:34.929> right

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
that's odd and that's on all right

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's odd and that's on all right
so<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.580> typhoon<00:01:37.060> -<00:01:37.300> doesn't<00:01:37.750> handle<00:01:38.110> very

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
so the typhoon - doesn't handle very

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.529 
so the typhoon - doesn't handle very
easily<00:01:38.619> on<00:01:38.979> land<00:01:39.310> but<00:01:39.880> didn't<00:01:40.179> they<00:01:40.270> say

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
easily on land but didn't they say

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.749 
easily on land but didn't they say
something<00:01:40.869> about<00:01:41.110> water<00:01:41.649> fly<00:01:41.979> over<00:01:42.250> land<00:01:42.520> and

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
something about water fly over land and

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.240 
something about water fly over land and
water<00:01:43.119> on<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> cushion<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.899> air<00:01:44.110> Queen<00:01:44.860> bigger

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
water on a cushion of air Queen bigger

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.969 
water on a cushion of air Queen bigger
more<00:01:45.520> powerful<00:01:45.550> turbo<00:01:46.450> motors<00:01:46.780> rise<00:01:47.259> now<00:01:47.710> this

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
more powerful turbo motors rise now this

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.050 
more powerful turbo motors rise now this
should<00:01:48.159> be<00:01:48.310> awesome

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060
