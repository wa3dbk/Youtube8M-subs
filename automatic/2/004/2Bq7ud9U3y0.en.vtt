00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.350
 the screw and dalmiro of touch only to 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 to hold 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.500

 not going to touch it ready yet 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.110

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.150
 What are you going to do with your hand? 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.030
 screw on the door 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.519

 heavily pressed 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.239

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:02.110
