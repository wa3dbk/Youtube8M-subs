new shield spray it looks like it's

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
new shield spray it looks like it's
probably<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.590> same<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> different

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
probably the same thing in a different

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
probably the same thing in a different
type<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> container<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.079> were

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
type of container I know they were

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
type of container I know they were
having<00:00:49.350> some<00:00:49.680> issues<00:00:49.980> some<00:00:50.399> people<00:00:50.670> reporting

having some issues some people reporting
that<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.420> leaked<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.530> maybe<00:00:52.829> that's<00:00:53.129> why

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that they leaked so maybe that's why

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.680 
that they leaked so maybe that's why
they<00:00:53.309> switched<00:00:53.699> containers<00:00:53.910> either<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they switched containers either way it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.490 
they switched containers either way it

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
actually went on very easily it's a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
actually went on very easily it's a
little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.610> different<00:01:47.970> type<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> material

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
little bit different type of material

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
little bit different type of material
than<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> previous<00:01:49.409> zags<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.009> less<00:01:50.250> rubbery

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
than the previous zags it's less rubbery

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
than the previous zags it's less rubbery
and<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.869> stiff<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and is a little more stiff so when you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.289 
and is a little more stiff so when you
place<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> phone<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.939> long<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.180> you've

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
take a look at the zagg itself now

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.580 
take a look at the zagg itself now
there's<00:02:15.719> a<00:02:15.780> couple<00:02:15.930> things<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.379> were<00:02:16.560> I

zoom in here a little bit now one of the
things<00:02:21.989> zags<00:02:22.319> generally<00:02:22.889> have<00:02:23.129> is<00:02:23.430> some

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
orange peel effect this one really

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.459 
orange peel effect this one really
doesn't<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.760> too<00:02:26.999> much<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.749> not<00:02:27.959> not

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
really bad at all as far as that goes

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.619 
really bad at all as far as that goes
let<00:02:30.719> me<00:02:30.810> move<00:02:31.079> it<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.469> way<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.389> see

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
let me move it this way so you can see

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.539 
let me move it this way so you can see
it's<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.319> it's<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:35.129> really<00:02:35.250> an

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
it's not really it's not really an

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.699 
it's not really it's not really an
orange<00:02:35.879> peel<00:02:36.090> effect<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:36.900> much<00:02:37.049> it's

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
orange peel effect there so much it's

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.890 
orange peel effect there so much it's
really<00:02:38.069> clear<00:02:38.489> when<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.849> screen<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.419> let

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
really clear when the screen is on let

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.559 
really clear when the screen is on let
me<00:02:39.959> go<00:02:40.079> ahead<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.319> turn<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.060> phone<00:02:42.359> on

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
me go ahead and turn the the phone on

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.309 
me go ahead and turn the the phone on
and<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.109> see<00:02:43.489> there's<00:02:44.489> my<00:02:44.879> logo<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.540> you

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and you can see there's my logo and you

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.869 
and you can see there's my logo and you
can<00:02:46.439> see<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.709> really<00:02:47.069> clear<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.519> hard<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
can see it's really clear it's hard to

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.729 
can see it's really clear it's hard to
tell<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.389> even<00:02:48.629> there<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.049> that's<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
tell that it's even there and that's the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.339 
tell that it's even there and that's the
idea<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.760> lot<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.419> these<00:02:51.510> screen<00:02:51.840> shields

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
idea is a lot of these screen shields

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.250 
idea is a lot of these screen shields
they<00:02:52.799> really<00:02:52.980> don't<00:02:53.269> show<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.449> vibrance<00:02:55.169> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
they really don't show the vibrance and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.349 
they really don't show the vibrance and
the<00:02:55.620> quality<00:02:56.159> of<00:02:56.189> the<00:02:56.459> retina<00:02:56.760> display<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
the quality of the retina display and

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.659 
the quality of the retina display and
this<00:02:58.049> one<00:02:58.290> certainly<00:02:58.620> does<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.250> really<00:02:59.400> does<00:02:59.639> a

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
this one certainly does it really does a

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.149 
this one certainly does it really does a
good<00:02:59.879> job<00:02:59.939> of<00:03:00.150> letting<00:03:00.650> light<00:03:01.650> through<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
good job of letting light through and

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.770 
good job of letting light through and
not<00:03:02.280> changing<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:02.969> so<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.359> looks<00:03:03.449> really

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
not changing it so that it looks really

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.539 
not changing it so that it looks really
clear<00:03:04.169> the<00:03:04.530> responsiveness<00:03:05.189> of<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
clear the responsiveness of the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.670 
clear the responsiveness of the
touchscreen<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.299> good<00:03:06.629> if<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.900> better<00:03:07.139> than<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
touchscreen is good if not better than a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.550 
touchscreen is good if not better than a
previous<00:03:08.129> zag<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.569> feels<00:03:09.599> strong<00:03:10.260> and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
previous zag and it feels strong and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.860 
previous zag and it feels strong and
like<00:03:10.829> it's<00:03:10.980> not<00:03:11.099> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.519> break<00:03:12.299> or<00:03:12.510> anything

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
like it's not going to break or anything

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.170 
like it's not going to break or anything
as<00:03:12.989> far<00:03:13.139> as<00:03:13.260> ripping<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:14.189> if<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.790> scratch<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
as far as ripping now if you scratch it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.149 
as far as ripping now if you scratch it
here<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.689> will<00:03:15.780> self<00:03:16.109> heal<00:03:16.409> so<00:03:16.620> i<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.889> i<00:03:17.040> can

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
here it will self heal so i can i can

it with my finger nail up there a little

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.670 
it with my finger nail up there a little
bit<00:03:27.889> and<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.699> it<00:03:30.209> will<00:03:30.479> self<00:03:30.810> heal<00:03:31.109> over<00:03:31.409> a<00:03:31.439> day

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
bit and it it will self heal over a day

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.349 
bit and it it will self heal over a day
or<00:03:31.859> so<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.459> won't<00:03:32.639> be<00:03:32.790> there<00:03:32.970> anymore<00:03:33.030> i

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
or so and it won't be there anymore i

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.759 
or so and it won't be there anymore i
did<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.689> across<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:33.989> top<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:34.709> you

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
did that across the top of it but you

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.249 
did that across the top of it but you
can<00:03:34.919> see<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.250> screen<00:03:35.489> quality<00:03:35.879> we<00:03:36.750> let<00:03:37.169> it

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:37.259 
can see the screen quality we let it

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.770 
can see the screen quality we let it
refocus<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:37.919> really<00:03:38.549> quite<00:03:39.120> good<00:03:39.359> through

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
refocus is really quite good through

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.770 
refocus is really quite good through
this<00:03:39.959> zagg<00:03:40.259> shield<00:03:40.290> very<00:03:41.159> very<00:03:41.459> nice<00:03:41.689> let<00:03:42.689> me

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.020 
this zagg shield very very nice let me
have<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:42.959> refocused<00:03:43.620> there<00:03:43.769> we<00:03:43.859> go<00:03:43.979> and<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
have it refocused there we go and the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.119 
have it refocused there we go and the
screen<00:03:45.329> quality<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.780> very<00:03:45.840> very<00:03:46.349> nice<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.949> does

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
screen quality is very very nice it does

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
a great job now one of the things that I

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.129 
a great job now one of the things that I
didn't<00:03:49.709> didn't<00:03:50.699> like<00:03:50.849> about<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.419> it

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
didn't didn't like about it is it

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.110 
didn't didn't like about it is it
doesn't<00:03:52.379> seem<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.709> cover<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.250> entire<00:03:53.340> device

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
doesn't seem to cover the entire device

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.399 
doesn't seem to cover the entire device
and<00:03:54.419> let<00:03:54.509> me<00:03:54.599> show<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.780> what<00:03:54.989> i<00:03:55.019> mean<00:03:55.079> by<00:03:55.379> that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
i zoom back in here right along this

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.569 
i zoom back in here right along this
edge<00:03:59.759> see<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.329> edge<00:04:00.509> right<00:04:00.540> here<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:02.310> edge

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
edge see this edge right here this edge

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.429 
edge see this edge right here this edge
doesn't<00:04:02.939> come<00:04:03.209> all<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.540> way<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.719> the<00:04:03.989> edge<00:04:04.139> of

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
doesn't come all the way to the edge of

doesn't come all the way to the edge of
the<00:04:04.709> iphone<00:04:05.129> now<00:04:05.669> i<00:04:05.699> have<00:04:06.509> some<00:04:06.750> suspicions

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
the iphone now i have some suspicions

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.860 
the iphone now i have some suspicions
that<00:04:07.379> they've<00:04:07.650> done<00:04:07.889> this<00:04:08.129> because<00:04:08.639> they<00:04:09.629> want

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
that they've done this because they want

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.659 
that they've done this because they want
to<00:04:10.079> allow<00:04:10.289> a<00:04:10.319> case<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.889> have<00:04:11.069> room<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.430> it's

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
to allow a case to have room and it's

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.240 
to allow a case to have room and it's
like<00:04:11.879> that<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.359> way<00:04:12.599> around<00:04:12.949> it<00:04:13.949> just

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
like that all the way around it just

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.209 
like that all the way around it just
does<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.579> cover<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.000> entire<00:04:15.239> device<00:04:15.840> if<00:04:16.219> i

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:17.219 
does not cover the entire device if i

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.870 
does not cover the entire device if i
grab<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.820> top<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.269> case<00:04:18.479> right<00:04:18.719> here<00:04:18.780> and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
grab the top of a case right here and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.700 
grab the top of a case right here and
bring<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.000> close<00:04:21.239> again<00:04:23.719> see<00:04:24.719> will<00:04:24.870> refocus<00:04:25.260> it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
bring it close again see will refocus it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.170 
bring it close again see will refocus it
really<00:04:26.039> doesn't<00:04:26.310> matter<00:04:26.430> because<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:27.000> goes

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
really doesn't matter because it goes

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.279 
really doesn't matter because it goes
all<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.389> way<00:04:27.509> around<00:04:27.539> there<00:04:28.020> there's<00:04:28.229> the

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
all the way around there there's the

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.320 
all the way around there there's the
scratch<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.860> put<00:04:29.039> in<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.250> goes<00:04:29.729> all<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.030> way

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
scratch I put in it goes all the way

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.510 
scratch I put in it goes all the way
around<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.840> edge<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.440> does<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:31.979> really<00:04:32.280> nice

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
around this edge and does a really nice

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.939 
around this edge and does a really nice
job<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.389> can<00:04:33.600> see<00:04:33.810> there<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:34.800> again

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
job but you can see there it is again

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.249 
job but you can see there it is again
it's<00:04:35.310> not<00:04:35.460> but<00:04:36.000> it's<00:04:36.240> not<00:04:36.449> all<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.750> way<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
it's not but it's not all the way to the

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.330 
it's not but it's not all the way to the
edge<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:37.740> device<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.810> really

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
edge of this device and it just really

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.360 
edge of this device and it just really
is<00:04:41.960> kind<00:04:42.960> of<00:04:43.110> odd<00:04:43.259> now<00:04:43.830> they<00:04:43.979> may<00:04:44.130> have<00:04:44.220> done

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
is kind of odd now they may have done

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.890 
is kind of odd now they may have done
that<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.580> make<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.970> easier<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.360> install<00:04:45.570> I've

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
that to make it easier to install I've

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.510 
that to make it easier to install I've
seen<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.259> on<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.410> couple<00:04:46.830> new<00:04:46.979> products<00:04:47.400> they

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
seen that on a couple new products they

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.650 
seen that on a couple new products they
just<00:04:47.699> don't<00:04:47.850> go<00:04:48.000> all<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> way<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.570> edge

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
just don't go all the way to the edge

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.840 
just don't go all the way to the edge
and<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.620> really<00:04:49.860> helps<00:04:50.220> with<00:04:50.340> keeping<00:04:50.699> air

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
and it really helps with keeping air

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.700 
and it really helps with keeping air
bubbles<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.330> having<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.660> last<00:04:51.990> longer<00:04:52.350> so

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
bubbles and having it last longer so

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.070 
bubbles and having it last longer so
maybe<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.130> why<00:04:53.310> they<00:04:53.340> do<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.639> I<00:04:54.080> haven't

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
maybe that's why they do it I haven't

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.749 
maybe that's why they do it I haven't
really<00:04:55.169> been<00:04:55.350> able<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.680> determine<00:04:55.889> why<00:04:56.190> now

that that it does feel more like the
glass<00:05:22.740> surface<00:05:23.039> not<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.580> hundred<00:05:23.880> percent<00:05:24.020> but

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020
