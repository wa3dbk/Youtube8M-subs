on<00:00:10.769> glass<00:00:11.340> using<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.200> basics<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
on glass using and one of the basics of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.630 
on glass using and one of the basics of
glass<00:00:14.490> using<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:15.000> cutting<00:00:15.509> your<00:00:16.139> glass<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:17.430> cut

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
glass using is cutting your glass to cut

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.970 
glass using is cutting your glass to cut
glass<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.300> need<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.779> glass<00:00:19.200> cutter<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:19.800> has

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
glass you need a glass cutter which has

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.730 
glass you need a glass cutter which has
oil<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.610> and<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:21.150> run<00:00:21.390> strips<00:00:22.230> along<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
oil in it and will run strips along the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.370 
oil in it and will run strips along the
glass<00:00:22.920> where<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.490> want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> cut<00:00:24.230> it<00:00:25.230> also

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
glass where you want to cut it also

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
glass where you want to cut it also
helps<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> ruler<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.430> you're<00:00:26.609> doing

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
helps to have a ruler if you're doing

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.339 
helps to have a ruler if you're doing
something<00:00:27.269> specific<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:28.080> actually

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
something specific I'm actually

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.109 
something specific I'm actually
something<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> didn't<00:00:29.220> mention<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
something I didn't mention in one of the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.509 
something I didn't mention in one of the
previous<00:00:30.599> videos<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:31.109> using<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.650> graded

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
previous videos I'm using a graded

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.869 
previous videos I'm using a graded
plastic<00:00:33.680> what<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.830> does<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.309> when<00:00:35.670> there's

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
plastic what that does is when there's

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.670 
plastic what that does is when there's
chips<00:00:36.269> and<00:00:36.510> shards<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.900> glass<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.440> fall<00:00:37.649> off

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
chips and shards of glass that fall off

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.069 
chips and shards of glass that fall off
they're<00:00:38.430> falling<00:00:38.820> into<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> plastic<00:00:39.660> itself

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
they're falling into the plastic itself

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
they're falling into the plastic itself
rather<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.530> me<00:00:40.770> accidentally<00:00:41.219> rubbing<00:00:41.579> my

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
rather than me accidentally rubbing my

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810 
rather than me accidentally rubbing my
hands<00:00:41.910> against<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> table<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.399> to<00:00:44.399> cut

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
hands against it on the table so to cut

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.779 
hands against it on the table so to cut
glass<00:00:45.260> did<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.289> first<00:00:46.649> score<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> should

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
glass did you first score it so I should

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930 
glass did you first score it so I should
say<00:00:47.910> score<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.450> cut<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.920> break<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
say score not cut and then you break it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.139 
say score not cut and then you break it
with<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> running<00:00:51.870> pliers<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.920> score<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
with the running pliers so to score you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
with the running pliers so to score you
start<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.960> end<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> glass<00:00:55.940> press

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
start on one end of the glass press

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.209 
start on one end of the glass press
fairly<00:00:57.420> hard<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> run<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> straight<00:00:59.129> line

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.160 

so<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.960> see

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
so there you can probably kind of see

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.219 
so there you can probably kind of see
the<00:01:04.350> cut<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.339> made<00:01:05.990> now<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.050> never

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the cut that was made now you never

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.930 
the cut that was made now you never
break<00:01:07.560> towards<00:01:07.950> yourself<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.550> can

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
break towards yourself because that can

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.330 
break towards yourself because that can
cause<00:01:09.690> shards<00:01:10.289> of<00:01:10.349> glass<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.740> come<00:01:10.890> flying<00:01:11.069> up

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
cause shards of glass to come flying up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.400 
cause shards of glass to come flying up
towards<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.149> always<00:01:12.450> break<00:01:12.690> away<00:01:12.929> and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
towards you you always break away and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.760 
towards you you always break away and
you<00:01:14.069> can<00:01:14.369> press<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:15.450> first<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.319> it's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you can press even first of all if it's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
you can press even first of all if it's
a<00:01:16.830> big<00:01:17.069> piece<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.819> can<00:01:17.970> usually

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a big piece like this you can usually

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.169 
a big piece like this you can usually
put<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.599> fingers<00:01:19.020> along<00:01:19.920> where<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.490> score

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
put your fingers along where the score

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.930 
put your fingers along where the score
is<00:01:21.390> keep<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.929> score<00:01:22.259> away<00:01:22.530> from<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.640> then

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
is keep the score away from you and then

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.339 
is keep the score away from you and then
just<00:01:24.330> push<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.399> snap<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.940> break<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:27.349 
just push and you can snap and break it

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:31.070 
just push and you can snap and break it
now<00:01:28.349> if<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> wanted<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> cut<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:30.720> smaller

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
now if I wanted to cut this in a smaller

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.540 
now if I wanted to cut this in a smaller
piece<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.800> I'll<00:01:32.069> show<00:01:32.190> you<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.399> use

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
piece and I'll show you how to use

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.290 
piece and I'll show you how to use
natural<00:01:32.759> pliers<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:35.190> there's<00:01:35.429> there's<00:01:35.819> my<00:01:35.970> cut

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
natural pliers so there's there's my cut

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.040 
natural pliers so there's there's my cut
and<00:01:37.399> on<00:01:38.399> this<00:01:38.759> pliers<00:01:40.220> there's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.399> little

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
and on this pliers there's a little

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.580 
and on this pliers there's a little
strip<00:01:43.050> right<00:01:43.289> here<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.840> bending<00:01:46.349> kind

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
strip right here that that bending kind

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.589 
strip right here that that bending kind
of<00:01:46.709> forces<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.190> glass<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.819> break<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.569> you

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
of forces the glass to break so you

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.889 
of forces the glass to break so you
would<00:01:48.929> want<00:01:48.959> that<00:01:49.229> strip<00:01:49.739> to<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
would want that strip to go on the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.339 
would want that strip to go on the
opposite<00:01:52.440> side<00:01:52.679> of<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:53.069> score<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.989> I<00:01:54.989> place

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
opposite side of the score and I place

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.339 
opposite side of the score and I place
this<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.890> center<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.289> then<00:01:58.289> just<00:01:58.319> squeeze

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
this in the center and then just squeeze

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.719 
this in the center and then just squeeze
and<00:02:01.700> again<00:02:02.700> there's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> sticker<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.989> but

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
and again there's a sticker on there but

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.270 
and again there's a sticker on there but
it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.970> easily<00:02:06.360> cut<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:07.679> can<00:02:07.800> do<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> same

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it is easily cut you can do the same

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.119 
it is easily cut you can do the same
thing<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.789> even<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> dike<00:02:09.660> row<00:02:09.929> itself<00:02:10.410> but

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
thing with even the dike row itself but

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.199 
thing with even the dike row itself but
if<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.550> need<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> cut<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> piece

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
if you're going to need to cut a piece

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.930 
if you're going to need to cut a piece
of<00:02:12.390> dichroic<00:02:12.989> glass<00:02:13.220> usually<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.550> will<00:02:14.730> want

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
of dichroic glass usually you will want

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.839 
of dichroic glass usually you will want
to<00:02:15.060> cut<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> side<00:02:15.780> without<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.230> coating

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.580 
to cut the side without the coating
so<00:02:17.209> if<00:02:17.299> I<00:02:17.359> wanted<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.689> cut<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:17.989> into<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> much

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
so if I wanted to cut this into a much

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.050 
so if I wanted to cut this into a much
smaller<00:02:18.829> piece<00:02:21.459> usually<00:02:22.459> something<00:02:22.939> this

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
smaller piece usually something this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.390 
smaller piece usually something this
small<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.629> too<00:02:23.959> small<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.439> actually<00:02:24.590> break<00:02:25.159> by

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
small is too small to actually break by

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.550 
small is too small to actually break by
hand<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.909> want<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.629> cut<00:02:26.749> on<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.930> opposite<00:02:27.319> side
