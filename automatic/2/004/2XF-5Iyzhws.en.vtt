as we were traveling around over weekend

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.910 
as we were traveling around over weekend
so<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.720> have<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.260> say<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.620> works<00:03:32.770> pretty

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
so I have to say that it works pretty

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.850 
so I have to say that it works pretty
well

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.690 
tie-down rails all the way through and
also<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:37.990> got<00:03:38.140> rear<00:03:38.410> legs<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.890> will<00:03:39.070> allow

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
also it's got rear legs that will allow

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.440 
also it's got rear legs that will allow
it<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.820> stabilize<00:03:40.150> itself<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.940> key<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.209> this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
it to stabilize itself the key to this

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.720 
it to stabilize itself the key to this
trailer<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.080> its<00:03:44.380> beauty<00:03:44.920> lies<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.400> fact

trailer and its beauty lies in the fact

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.630 
trailer and its beauty lies in the fact
that<00:03:45.820> fully<00:03:46.420> loaded<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:47.530> no<00:03:48.130> heavier<00:03:48.520> than

let me tell you I would much rather take

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.850 
let me tell you I would much rather take
this<00:04:27.700> because<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.620> tucks<00:04:29.620> along

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
this because it just tucks along

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.070 
this because it just tucks along
beautifully<00:04:30.570> surprise<00:04:31.570> package<00:04:31.960> this

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
beautifully surprise package this

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.200 
beautifully surprise package this
particular<00:04:32.380> one's<00:04:32.740> about<00:04:33.030> $5,000<00:04:34.030> by<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
particular one's about $5,000 by the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.180 
particular one's about $5,000 by the
time<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.810> put<00:04:35.290> a<00:04:35.320> few<00:04:35.530> extras<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:35.890> everything

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
time you put a few extras and everything

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.030 
time you put a few extras and everything
on<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.570> great<00:04:37.570> value<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:38.140> guess<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.919> only

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
on it great value I guess the only

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
on it great value I guess the only
negatives<00:04:39.640> for<00:04:39.940> me<00:04:40.150> are<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:41.729> because<00:04:42.729> it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
negatives for me are that because it

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.030 
negatives for me are that because it
does<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.810> fold<00:04:44.110> down<00:04:44.440> rear<00:04:46.560> load<00:04:47.560> access

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
does have the fold down rear load access

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.219 
does have the fold down rear load access

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.810 
there's a bit of an issue with sealing
around<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.620> edges<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.250> got<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.550> drain

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
around the edges and it's got to drain

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.670 
around the edges and it's got to drain
holes<00:04:52.090> in<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.360> front<00:04:52.570> for<00:04:53.140> me<00:04:53.260> I'd<00:04:53.410> rather

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
holes in the front for me I'd rather

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.710 
holes in the front for me I'd rather
something<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.250> was<00:04:54.430> totally<00:04:54.910> sealed<00:04:55.180> to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
something that was totally sealed to

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.440 
something that was totally sealed to
prevent<00:04:56.020> dust<00:04:56.260> getting<00:04:56.710> in<00:04:56.830> none<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.820> us<00:04:57.910> did

prevent dust getting in none of us did

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.760 
prevent dust getting in none of us did
get<00:04:58.630> in<00:04:58.750> over<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.960> weekend<00:04:59.260> but<00:04:59.410> certainly

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
get in over the weekend but certainly

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.380 
get in over the weekend but certainly
more<00:05:00.070> than<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.430> expect<00:05:00.729> if<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:00.940> go<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.090> lot<00:05:01.270> of

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
more than you expect if you go a lot of

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.810 
more than you expect if you go a lot of
your<00:05:01.540> gear<00:05:01.780> in<00:05:01.960> there<00:05:02.169> or<00:05:03.010> put<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.490> all<00:05:03.610> in

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
your gear in there or put it all in

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.320 
your gear in there or put it all in
containers<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:06.250> other<00:05:06.400> thing<00:05:06.729> there's<00:05:07.210> a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
containers the other thing there's a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.930 
containers the other thing there's a
slight<00:05:07.600> negative<00:05:07.780> for<00:05:08.140> me<00:05:08.260> is<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.940> because

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
slight negative for me is that because

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.409 
slight negative for me is that because
it<00:05:10.090> has<00:05:10.180> such<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.510> short<00:05:10.930> draw<00:05:11.229> bar

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.609 

very<00:05:16.419> short<00:05:16.779> between<00:05:16.899> there<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.349> there<00:05:17.499> and

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:17.619 
very short between there and there and

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:19.350 
very short between there and there and
because<00:05:17.919> it<00:05:18.069> is<00:05:18.129> so<00:05:18.369> light<00:05:18.669> it's<00:05:19.179> actually

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
because it is so light it's actually

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.789 
because it is so light it's actually
really<00:05:19.839> hard<00:05:20.019> to<00:05:20.169> back<00:05:20.349> in<00:05:20.529> certain

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:20.799 
really hard to back in certain

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.199 
really hard to back in certain
circumstances<00:05:21.099> because<00:05:21.639> it<00:05:21.759> has<00:05:21.849> a<00:05:21.879> mind<00:05:22.149> of

you<00:05:23.319> can<00:05:23.559> get<00:05:23.739> an<00:05:23.829> option<00:05:24.129> for<00:05:24.279> along<00:05:24.579> the

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
you can get an option for along the

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.269 
you can get an option for along the
drawbar<00:05:25.149> as<00:05:25.329> well<00:05:25.769> the<00:05:26.769> advantage<00:05:27.129> of<00:05:27.189> the

drawbar as well the advantage of the

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.699 
drawbar as well the advantage of the
short<00:05:27.519> drawbar<00:05:27.969> is<00:05:28.209> that<00:05:28.479> you<00:05:28.719> really<00:05:29.229> can<00:05:29.529> go

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:29.709 
short drawbar is that you really can go

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:32.759 
short drawbar is that you really can go
up<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.069> down<00:05:30.839> places<00:05:31.839> that<00:05:32.079> you<00:05:32.259> can't<00:05:32.499> take<00:05:32.739> a

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:32.769 
up and down places that you can't take a

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:34.559 
up and down places that you can't take a
bigger<00:05:33.009> trailer<00:05:33.279> because<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.999> doesn't<00:05:34.419> have

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
bigger trailer because it doesn't have

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.339 
bigger trailer because it doesn't have
that<00:05:34.599> same<00:05:34.779> ramp<00:05:35.289> over<00:05:35.439> angle<00:05:37.019> look<00:05:38.019> I'd<00:05:38.199> have

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
that same ramp over angle look I'd have

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.109 
that same ramp over angle look I'd have
