invader<00:03:27.340> sounds<00:03:28.340> really<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.480> probably

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
invader sounds really so probably

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.059 
invader sounds really so probably
need<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:29.989> rewire<00:03:30.439> this<00:03:30.590> with<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.829> correct

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
need to rewire this with the correct

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.089 
need to rewire this with the correct
pots<00:03:31.420> capacitors<00:03:32.420> resistors<00:03:32.920> I'll<00:03:33.920> get

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
pots capacitors resistors I'll get

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.640 
pots capacitors resistors I'll get
decent<00:03:34.310> wine<00:03:34.579> diagram<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.650> hopefully

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
decent wine diagram for it and hopefully

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.890 
decent wine diagram for it and hopefully
it'll<00:03:37.010> play<00:03:37.370> as<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.700> should<00:03:37.939> and<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
it'll play as it should and and for the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.599 
it'll play as it should and and for the
purposes<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.349> this<00:03:42.650> video<00:03:42.859> I'm<00:03:43.189> going<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.430> turn

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
purposes of this video I'm going to turn

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.520 
purposes of this video I'm going to turn
the<00:03:43.760> microphone<00:03:43.939> off<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.599> record<00:03:45.319> directly

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
the microphone off and record directly

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.589 
the microphone off and record directly
from<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.099> line<00:03:46.280> 6<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:47.120> get<00:03:47.269> an<00:03:47.420> accurate

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
from the line 6 to get an accurate

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.440 
from the line 6 to get an accurate
comparison<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.379> tone<00:03:48.700> because<00:03:49.700> what<00:03:49.879> you<00:03:50.030> hear

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
comparison of tone because what you hear

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.410 
comparison of tone because what you hear
through<00:03:51.439> your<00:03:51.620> speakers<00:03:51.829> will<00:03:52.340> be<00:03:52.459> what<00:03:52.819> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
through your speakers will be what the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.379 
through your speakers will be what the

60<00:03:57.250> see<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.459> bit<00:03:58.549> guys
