00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 you guard friend of the bad channel that I do not 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.549
 know I am animates that and I come to 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.099
 present you a guide to a character 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.000
 pretty funny about flix the expert in 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.710
 explosives this more will be the good bomb 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.330
 for the people who just saw me 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.190
 first time we will do the following 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.230
 as always he first explained the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 skills then explained the order of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 Priority of skills 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.300
 then the objects and then teach them 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.460
 scenes of the game for more or less you see 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 how is the character first thing is his 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.599
 passive fuse cuts the next attack 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.630
 basic say and fix magical damage image 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 additional every two or three seconds 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 we will reduce suffering every time you use 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.700
 a skill this life comes in handy 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.809
 for 7 ar or to give a blow to a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.809
 champion since it hurts enough 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.310
 now we will upload the most important visit 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.110
 with more bounces t is a bomb that 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.910
 we can launch the two ways or 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.710
 directly objective action or if 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.990
 we approach we launch mid -range 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.580
 usually the ball to bounce stability 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.840
 it comes very well because it has very little 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.840
 yields and does a lot of damage 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.429
 an unimportant measure and that we 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.229
 it's more to jump the load 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.780
 concentrated as you know a load 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.180
 explosive that stops 24 seconds when 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430
 we will give it back again when 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.659
 we have an enemy come out knocked down and if 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 it does not give us we also go flying 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.100
 this skill I use defensively 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.869
 to be able to escape from the enemy 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.390
 the next skill we have is 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.820
 field of explosives as you know are the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.070
 mines that the ground gives you and when a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.690
 approaching enemy steps on it or you 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.149
 graus over that the best we can 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.979
 do and we said magic damage and what 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.250
 slow down we have a 40 percent to 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.649
 maximum level for 1.5 seconds 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 every time we activate more mines we do 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.030
 40% more damage than the other mines 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.670
 as you can see the mine will be deactivated more or 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.590
 less at 10 seconds last 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.049
 we have a definitive mega bomb 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.110
 incendiaria this stability has 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.429
 very much reach a house of 5,300 and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.380
 stability what it does is that it has a 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.039
 pump to a place and it does great damage 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 in stability area it serves a lot to 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.210
 prevent enemies from escaping 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.700
 how are you seeing the image from level 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.160
 1 we will go up the reporter and it will be 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.800
 our priority because the debutante 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.540
 It has very little cb and it does a lot of damage and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.310
 we are very interested in bearing the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.080
 line from the middle to level 2 we will go up 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.570
 only once charged with concentrated 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.450
 to be able to jump from enemies or 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.130
 knock down the others at level 4 and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.160
 we will finish after the field 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.960
 explosives because we will have it on you 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 the enemies to be able to analyze it a 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.160
 little more and more each time they are 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.380
 impacted by other mines we will make a 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 40% more damage and as always 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.550
 we will respect the priority of the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.550
 definitive of the mega incendiary bomb 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.760
 let's talk about as a team 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.080
 when we start games we will catch you 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.880
 speed boots and three portions of 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.080
 life for people who do not know about 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.330
 Life position gives us more 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.070
 survival when we go back 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.080
 first time base we will get two 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.970
 rings will be as you know not the 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.190
 enough regeneration to endure in 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.930
 the middle lane without problems as well 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.519
 to gain life and power ability 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.859
 in the previous video I forgot to put 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.599
 the boot in this is not worth it and we will take off 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.219
 the boots of chicheros as you know the 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.489
 bottle and 0 gives us the magical insight 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.840
 and since we are a magician, it does not matter enough 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.549
 is not to catch emma now the object more 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.709
 important of the magicians the cap shows 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.780
 of basque and what interests us the most is 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.189
 his only passive that does not increase by 30 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.939
 percent the total of our power the 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.930
 ability 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.670
 the next object that we should 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.769
 villar should not be a vacuum cane 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.420
 as you know if an enemy gets 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.859
 magic resistance with the cane 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.629
 empty pennetta we owe your much 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.730
 magic resistance and we will lower it 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.069
 quite another object more than we will catch 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.470
 will be the relay crystal center like 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.849
 you know does not give life power of ability and 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.379
 its massive one makes us do what 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.090
 enemy slows enemies is not so 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.060
 effective as we guarantee with the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.500
 bombs the fields of explosives but we 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.240
 interesting because it increases our 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.580
 survival 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.530
 now the object that we will catch will be the 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.960
 temptation death and line as you know not the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.550
 portability exception emanates a unique 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.380
 passive that will referencing and what 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.350
 that interests us is only active that 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.760
 we inflict damage on the target champion by 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.640
 the value of 30% of our current life 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.410
 that is 3.5 percent per 100 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.020
 of skill power this what will 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 is to melt directly a champion 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.639
 enemy 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.920
 the last object is the most controversial but 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.790
 Sincerely, he has never reached 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.070
 need him because he always just 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.300
 good game before the last object 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.919
 it could be for example a will of 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.690
 the old because it gives us a solution 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.950
 spell and one hour for the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.040
 come mates solution spell 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.780
 and portability did not come very well for 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.980
 endure more our survival 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.660
 also in case we have a lot 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.850
 cream with the enemies we could catch 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.470
 a sonia hourglass that is like 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.050
 you know not the armor can of skill 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.669
 and could put us our only active 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.580
 which makes it invulnerable for two 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.910
 seconds that plus the last object to be 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.910
 at your choice 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.050
 well or it will be a trick I have thrown the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.879
 last thing that fails but as you see 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.189
 I'm going to teach that the marbles are like 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.960
 refer to the marbles is worth the pump be 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.520
 the cream the people but the marbles if the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.069
 we throw at the feet of the champion 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.990
 enemy because if it gets us what 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.149
 he has the possibility of being eaten and 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.009
 it has to come back and we will do more damage 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:23.080
 because it is more guaranteed ie 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.120
 Of course more mines are eaten, more damage 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.520
 well, well, not another example because 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.500
 If it is very simple and safe always 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.189
 same is to say look at the feet and go 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.259
 throwing bombs 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.759
 Well, thank you so much for watching me 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.590
 I hope you liked the video and that 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.870
 I serve you asked me this guide said 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.919
 For quite some time I have gone up 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.719
 Faster truthfully and honestly 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.729
 Well, as I always say, subscribe if 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.680
 you want to ask me for the guide that you want 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.599
 I will do it as quickly as possible and 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.599
 thank you very much for seeing me and greetings
