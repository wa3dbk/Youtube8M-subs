00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.580
 in a well-known exercise of the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.650
 coaching the wheel of life a circle 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.700
 divided into eight slices as if it were 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.060
 a pizza 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 each slice is an area of ​​your life 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 what areas of your life do you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.019
 You know, I do not know you're going to give these names and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.680
 externally fill in the wheel 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.900
 with these new me as a mother that this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.770
 apathy will have a maternity 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.860
 I as a companion of my husband 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.790
 then this slice is called relationship 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 loving 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.149
 I as a professional then like 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.250
 call this slice to you all of a sudden 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.250
 is filling and a slice divides 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 in two or you 're group all right you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 that will give this node 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.770
 I do not really like the wheels of life that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.070
 already filled 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 I like those who name who they are 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 doing only you know if there is a slice 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.890
 called spirituality to call the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.720
 sport or if all this for you wants 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.240
 say health want to be there to be the name 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.240
 parts of your grandmother aside 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 there are some people will want a round 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.100
 extra I have many areas of expertise to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 My life will have to send it to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.520
 another will be that smoking consume division or 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 then on a lot of white booty 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.590
 This means what you walk with. 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.229
 occupying your time with just such things 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.800
 but only who has a slice that represents 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.520
 an action that has not been done in this 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.790
 moment things you abandoned things 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 that you wish 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.119
 It started then I want to start one where 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.850
 Dance I want to do something for my 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.140
 health will reflect on this until 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.990
 complete 8 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.330
 This is the first step I'm taking. 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.280
 Growing up and playing this good I leave too 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:16.440
 life well know leisure wheel complete with 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.540
 names will start to range from 0 to 10 10 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.570
 in the center of the conference idea at the tip 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.330
 how satisfied are you with that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.260
 only slightly different from giving a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.100
 note why you were not that year you 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 You will amplify the return that it 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.799
 gives then she was seen a lot in my 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.850
 maternity when you are satisfied 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:48.120
 with this or else look I swear I 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.640
 I walk in a week is half an hour. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 but I'm super satisfied with this is 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 the most I can give now or it's 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.910
 something I want to keep is something I 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.480
 I want to increase 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.340
 finally a degree of satisfaction is how much 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.940
 Your actions are returning to you. 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.140
 positively in that area of ​​your life 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.230
 if not only will you have a nursery 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.130
 No, the second step is complete. 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.760
 Look at this wheel you can color the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.720
 rotate the slices each one will have a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.120
 size 283 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.170
 from there you can start to 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.400
 think of a growth projection for 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:43.260
 each slice does not establish a period 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.680
 You can then reach the majority who 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.390
 They are between six months and one year you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.760
 Do you want to be in the slice for six months? 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:59.160
 Where do you want to be from here? 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:04.100
 six months on self-care slice colors 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:19.590
 of another color or moth to make a stroke 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:23.880
 with this new little number was 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.680
 to photograph life colmata proposes in 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.660
 first stop and think about what are 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.690
 areas of your life that are bringing 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.250
 feedback question of adaptation 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:39.000
 Which one do you want to grow up in? How are you? 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.040
 has a different color where you 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.070
 Do you want to get the dick? 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:51.680
 so I get there and there's a 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:57.420
 a personal project compared to that one 1 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:01.140
 to the national who comes professionally is 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.360
 famous also begin to emerge 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.970
 clicks the insights of our I can 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.740
 comment this but simple than me 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.140
 I thought I did not need to go back to 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.710
 run seven days a week 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:18.870
 but if I start for once a week 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:23.940
 and this will feed me then the wheel 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.910
 brings a dynamic dynamic 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:32.910
 is really cool is to bring forward a plan 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:37.550
 more concrete ideas and plans than 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:41.700
 times are very much in ideas 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.950
 dispersed then realizes a lot 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.110
 the return I hear is that ours is 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.080
 cool is my next wheel 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.590
 photography wants to adjust 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.030
 she is dynamic then when making her wheel 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.740
 complete your wheel activity 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.850
 self-knowledge you can do 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.850
 so you can do your health, right?
