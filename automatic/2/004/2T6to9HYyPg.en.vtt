two screws that they give you it's a
Phillips<00:01:26.189> head<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.420> using<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.960> cordless

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Phillips head and I'm using a cordless

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.370 
Phillips head and I'm using a cordless
drill<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> clutch<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> doesn't<00:01:31.110> over

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
drill with a clutch so it doesn't over

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.940 
drill with a clutch so it doesn't over
tighten<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.189> screw<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.530> tighten<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
tighten the screw so as I tighten it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010 
tighten the screw so as I tighten it
down<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> slips<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> adjust<00:01:36.750> how

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
down then it slips and I can adjust how

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
down then it slips and I can adjust how
much<00:01:37.170> pressure<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
much pressure I use and so I'm going to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.960 
much pressure I use and so I'm going to
put<00:01:39.479> two<00:01:39.659> screws<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.710> bracket<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.430> then

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
put two screws in this bracket and then

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.700 
put two screws in this bracket and then

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
pre-drilled holes and we're going to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.520 
pre-drilled holes and we're going to
make<00:02:12.550> sure<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.360> edge<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.140> has<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
edge has four holes so that we push it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.980 
edge has four holes so that we push it
into<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.990> metal<00:02:26.980> pegs<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.270> wood<00:02:28.720> pegs

into the metal pegs and the wood pegs

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.470 
into the metal pegs and the wood pegs
and<00:02:29.920> we'll<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.400> tap<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.760> into<00:02:30.910> place<00:02:31.000> and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
and we'll just tap it into place and

into it and drill straight down the lip

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.640 
into it and drill straight down the lip
that<00:04:31.970> you're<00:04:32.240> screwing<00:04:32.810> into<00:04:32.960> or<00:04:33.380> nailing

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
into rather is very narrow and if it

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.560 
into rather is very narrow and if it
comes<00:04:36.950> off<00:04:37.100> at<00:04:37.280> an<00:04:37.370> angle<00:04:37.520> at<00:04:37.790> all<00:04:38.000> you're

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
comes off at an angle at all you're

going to have a problem tearing through
the<00:04:40.100> face<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:41.090> we<00:04:41.270> need<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:41.540> go<00:04:41.660> straight<00:04:41.990> down

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
the face so we need to go straight down

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.320 
the face so we need to go straight down
that's<00:04:42.950> why<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> would<00:04:43.370> recommend<00:04:43.520> if<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.150> have

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
here if you have a larger hammer it's

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.810 
here if you have a larger hammer it's
going<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.260> be<00:04:54.320> hard<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.680> get<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.370> close

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
going to be hard to get it in close

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.030 
going to be hard to get it in close
enough<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.570> where<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:56.780> want<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.260> what

ten<00:05:29.819> holes<00:05:30.449> to<00:05:30.749> hang<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:31.860> we'll<00:05:32.310> build<00:05:32.580> the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
ten holes to hang it so we'll build the

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:33.890 
ten holes to hang it so we'll build the
rest<00:05:32.879> of<00:05:32.969> the<00:05:33.030> wall<00:05:33.180> units<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:33.659> we'll<00:05:33.749> go<00:05:33.840> to

rest of the wall units and we'll go to

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.099 
rest of the wall units and we'll go to
the<00:05:33.990> next<00:05:34.110> step<00:05:34.379> of<00:05:34.560> mounting<00:05:35.009> up
