and<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.880> point<00:01:51.180> we're<00:01:51.360> ready<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.659> combine

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and at that point we're ready to combine

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.170 
and at that point we're ready to combine
the<00:01:52.229> two<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.220> wind<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.490> taking<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.970> hot

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the two if we wind up taking this hot

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.819 
the two if we wind up taking this hot
liquid<00:01:54.600> however<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.140> dump<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:55.500> into

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
liquid however and we dump it right into

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.830 
liquid however and we dump it right into
these<00:01:56.130> eggs<00:01:56.430> what's<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.030> happen<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
these eggs what's going to happen is the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
these eggs what's going to happen is the
hot<00:01:57.990> liquid<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.560> hovering<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.100> around

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
hot liquid which is hovering at around

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.700 
hot liquid which is hovering at around
200<00:02:00.149> degrees<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.719> now<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> wind

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
200 degrees right now is going to wind

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.200 
200 degrees right now is going to wind
up<00:02:01.799> cooking<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.250> eggs<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.729> they're<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
up cooking the eggs and they're going to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
up cooking the eggs and they're going to
scramble<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> things<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
scramble so one of the things that we do

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
scramble so one of the things that we do
is<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.850> gradually<00:02:06.479> introduce<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> hot<00:02:07.229> liquid

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
is we gradually introduce the hot liquid

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.380 
is we gradually introduce the hot liquid
into<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.890> eggs<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.759> process<00:02:09.209> called

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
into the eggs and a process called

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
into the eggs and a process called
tempering<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.349> take<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.679> hot<00:02:10.890> liquid

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
tempering going to take my hot liquid

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.340 
tempering going to take my hot liquid
and<00:02:11.520> slowly<00:02:12.030> pour<00:02:12.480> in

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and slowly pour in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
and slowly pour in
liquid<00:02:13.860> into<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.160> bowl<00:02:14.430> while<00:02:14.940> I'm

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
liquid into the bowl while I'm

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.150 
liquid into the bowl while I'm
constantly<00:02:15.540> whipping<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> what<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.680> does<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
constantly whipping it what this does is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.380 
constantly whipping it what this does is
this<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.400> gonna<00:02:17.610> bring<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> temperature

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this is gonna bring up the temperature

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.870 
this is gonna bring up the temperature
of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> eggs<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.380> cool<00:02:19.980> off<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.400> temperature

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
of the eggs and cool off the temperature

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.060 
of the eggs and cool off the temperature
of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> hot<00:02:21.180> dairy<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.350> eggs<00:02:22.560> don't

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
of the hot dairy so the eggs don't

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.400 
of the hot dairy so the eggs don't
scramble<00:02:23.460> very<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.630> some<00:02:24.840> hot<00:02:24.990> water<00:02:25.200> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
scramble very have some hot water you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.990 
scramble very have some hot water you
can<00:02:25.560> tell<00:02:25.770> from<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> steam<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.640> floating

our bowl set it over the pot lower the
heat<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.470> then<00:02:34.710> we<00:02:34.860> want<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.130> begin<00:02:35.340> stirring

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
too long the eggs are going to scramble

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.580 
too long the eggs are going to scramble
you're<00:02:45.150> gonna<00:02:45.240> get<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.510> big<00:02:45.780> thick<00:02:45.810> layer<00:02:46.290> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you're gonna get a big thick layer of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.320 
you're gonna get a big thick layer of
cooked<00:02:46.860> egg<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> edge<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.610> your<00:02:47.670> spatula

cooked egg on the edge of your spatula

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.540 
cooked egg on the edge of your spatula
and<00:02:48.810> also<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.590> vanilla<00:02:49.860> sauce<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:50.460> to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
and also your vanilla sauce is going to

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.690 
and also your vanilla sauce is going to
have<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.820> decidedly<00:02:51.240> cooked<00:02:51.510> egg<00:02:51.690> taste<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.260> it

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
have it decidedly cooked egg taste to it

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.650 
have it decidedly cooked egg taste to it
which<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.880> something<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.210> we're<00:02:54.450> not

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
which is something that we're not

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.530 
which is something that we're not
looking<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.950> continue<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.520> stir<00:02:56.820> notice

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
looking for as I continue to stir notice

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.120 
looking for as I continue to stir notice
I'm<00:02:57.660> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> take<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.140> spatula<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.740> go<00:02:58.920> all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
I'm going to take the spatula and go all

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.310 
I'm going to take the spatula and go all
around<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.880> circumference<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.960> liquid

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
and all over the bottom of the bowl want

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.920 
and all over the bottom of the bowl want
to<00:03:04.770> keep<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.190> mixture<00:03:05.550> moving<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.690> bad

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
to keep that mixture moving not a bad

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and make sure your water underneath is

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.040 
and make sure your water underneath is
not<00:03:10.560> boiling<00:03:10.910> after<00:03:11.910> several<00:03:12.540> moments<00:03:12.660> you'll

not boiling after several moments you'll

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.720 
not boiling after several moments you'll
actually<00:03:13.230> notice<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> liquid<00:03:14.370> inside

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
actually notice that the liquid inside

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.040 
actually notice that the liquid inside
the<00:03:14.880> bowl<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.270> going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> increase<00:03:15.810> in

you're going to notice the liquid as the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.100 
you're going to notice the liquid as the
