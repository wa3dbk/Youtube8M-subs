00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
going for about 50 K this is kind of a

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.410 
going for about 50 K this is kind of a
expensive<00:03:04.670> grind<00:03:05.560> meaning<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.209> it's<00:03:08.209> not

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
expensive grind meaning that it's not

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
have to really kind of refreshing search

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.780 
have to really kind of refreshing search
until<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.989> get<00:03:24.109> a<00:03:24.139> good<00:03:24.349> deal<00:03:24.609> before<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.670> can

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
until you get a good deal before you can

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.390 
until you get a good deal before you can
actually<00:03:25.969> sell<00:03:26.329> sell<00:03:26.870> them<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.439> wouldn't<00:03:28.310> I

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
actually sell sell them so I wouldn't I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520 
actually sell sell them so I wouldn't I
wouldn't<00:03:28.430> necessarily<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> Julian

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
wouldn't necessarily going to Julian

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.140 
wouldn't necessarily going to Julian
Edelman<00:03:30.980> let's<00:03:31.129> look<00:03:31.189> at<00:03:31.340> Jamie<00:03:31.519> Collins<00:03:31.790> real

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
Edelman let's look at Jamie Collins real

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.569 
Edelman let's look at Jamie Collins real
quick<00:03:32.419> he<00:03:33.290> seems<00:03:33.560> kind<00:03:33.799> of<00:03:33.829> expensive<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.370> well

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
quick he seems kind of expensive as well

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.509 
quick he seems kind of expensive as well
it's<00:03:35.450> an<00:03:35.569> expensive<00:03:35.870> grind<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:37.280> might

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
it's an expensive grind like you might

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.530 
it's an expensive grind like you might
get<00:03:37.760> one<00:03:37.790> at<00:03:38.299> about<00:03:38.419> 70<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:39.200> 60<00:03:39.590> k<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.389> you<00:03:41.389> know

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
get one at about 70 to 60 k but you know

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.729 
get one at about 70 to 60 k but you know
depending<00:03:41.989> on<00:03:42.189> how<00:03:43.189> much<00:03:44.409> they're<00:03:45.409> gonna<00:03:45.530> take

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
depending on how much they're gonna take

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.309 
depending on how much they're gonna take
away<00:03:45.950> 9k<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:46.879> you<00:03:46.969> only<00:03:47.540> have<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.870> opportunity

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
away 9k so you only have the opportunity

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.729 
away 9k so you only have the opportunity
to<00:03:48.349> make<00:03:48.530> about<00:03:49.510> 10k<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.840> then<00:03:51.409> you<00:03:51.530> have<00:03:51.709> to

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
to make about 10k and then you have to

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.289 
to make about 10k and then you have to
constantly<00:03:52.129> watch<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:52.849> that's<00:03:53.000> not<00:03:53.120> really

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
constantly watch it so that's not really

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.360 
constantly watch it so that's not really
sell<00:03:54.079> like<00:03:54.290> grinds<00:03:54.590> where<00:03:54.919> you<00:03:55.069> know<00:03:55.189> there's
