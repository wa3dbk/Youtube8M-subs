00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.179
 Hello everyone, Vodka horns with you 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.370
 especially dangerous that I find a tough fight and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.460
 I comment on it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.010
 player and from the very battle the first is 10 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.800
 frags can of course and more second 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.320
 this is a machine level not lower than 8 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 well, the third requirement from the player player 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.100
 must inflict 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.890
 and less than 6 thousand damage in fact it 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.870
 not so much but rarely fights with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 lots of damages giving btr 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.769
 It is not rare that I will be friends with me 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.289
 everyone agrees with me what to look at 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.149
 shooting bush I wonder of course 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.129
 if you want to watch the face 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.929
 cool cat player who stands 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.940
 Permanent fear is just friends 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.219
 write in the comments and then probably 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.859
 in the near future there will be a fight either 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.239
 Already the next release will be a fight and such 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.239
 shooting bush from navi 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.420
 and now let's go directly to 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 most fights in 4202 that is our hero under 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.010
 by both 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.940
 the very beginning is not a bad position 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.729
 the only thing you need is 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.130
 comfortable wayne and in area 8 our hero 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.710
 I chose it just for this card at 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.690
 war in 10 degrees will let u understand 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.119
 to realize all that he conceived in this 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.400
 the battle namely neatly and competently with the game 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.650
 in order to leave the end of the fight like 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.140
 can more hp for positive and 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.410
 successful exchange of strength points so what 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.050
 are we still in full 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.509
 for us is a sign for our team to know 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.190
 the fact that we are ready to win this battle to 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.950
 sorry allies on this flank are not 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.470
 supports our hero plan to win 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.080
 in this fight you blame them 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.060
 they cannot be killed by an invisible enemy 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.060
 which finger is always scratched 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.770
 Sorry the speed is at 42 but 2 is not 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.740
 allows our hero to arrive on time 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.810
 and we do not have time to save the object 140 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.780
 now we are three against four 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.670
 opponents and 2 art allied art just 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.370
 perfectly copes with its task 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.440
 just great and since our 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.870
 the guy shot gold land mines the enemy 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.490
 on a lion gone with one shot would be 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.620
 there would be any other stack 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.810
 formed to understand at least 6 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.750
 seconds longer with this and would definitely become 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250
 320 x n less visible 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.440
 enemy batchat which before 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.930
 time is not clear where I cooled off 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.300
 a shot of our guy spooked a drum 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.300
 the enemy although it would seem friends everything must 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.550
 to be the other way around but not here it was if 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.530
 I was in place butt 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.400
 thinking flew into the british 100 not 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.050
 thinking 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.110
 the enemy art must not be from me 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.510
 expected and yes I would probably die well 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.820
 left vanshotom state enemy that's 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.020
 exactly on the farther everything is just my allies 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.390
 send spv 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.209
 and defenseless of that and that's the whole game friends 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.940
 that's the whole game but in the end you see for yourself 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.530
 what game is over for bochata this 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.330
 the moment we see allied death 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.220
 artillery on object 261 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.739
 and this is a bad sign and the faster we 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.880
 get rid of artillery as a firefighter 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:33.530
 the faster we leave the world 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:35.510
 what does that mean and that means we can 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.670
 will appear in an unexpected place for the enemy 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.250
 but before that it is necessary to destroy the artillery 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.770
 but the projectile flies in millimeters 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.150
 ok centimeters from bochata and he 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.820
 hiding behind cover at the same second 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.800
 both shot and clear 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.130
 the arrow shows where this shot comes from 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.130
 was made 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.600
 6th century and this it boils over done 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.640
 job guy in british from i'm drawing 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.220
 your attention to a bad shot 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.290
 American art I personally such players 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.350
 I do not understand myself spent on art 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.980
 Please note a high level of more than 30 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.919
 fights 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.470
 true on the county press but not the essence so 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.710
 Here if you on arteries leaves on you 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.030
 enemy you must do the following 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.340
 First, determine what the average damage 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.889
 the enemy is somewhere over half the players 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.350
 I know the exact or approximate parameters of those 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.870
 or other tanks secondly you must 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.720
 know enemy recharge plus or minus 1 2 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.180
 second well, and in the third to shoot proceeding 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.700
 of all of the above you have two 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.650
 the course of action is the first if you 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.050
 leave the enemy whose average damage 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.140
 higher than your amount hp then 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.240
 shoot without hesitation immediately second 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.400
 course of action if you leave 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.150
 an enemy whose average damage is below your 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.669
 amount hp 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.440
 that means you have time to reduce 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.050
 get one shot from the enemy but 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.300
 whistle it destroy either sex 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.669
 blame the enemy car but of course 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.440
 case in the game are different and only you 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.169
 decide such actions to take in 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.790
 or that moment Well our friends 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.770
 the hero is left alone against two 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.229
 Opponent can the situation for you 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.600
 seem not dangerous and now remember 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.700
 what is the average damage and when have borscht and 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.580
 think carefully again with all 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.150
 the pluses of the gun are also a disguise 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.570
 quite dangerous enemy even for level 80 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.450
 only not for air force 4202 is the only one 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.479
 st level 10 which has golds 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.370
 land mines with the highest penetration enemy 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.919
 fr and leaves all sharp shots but not 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.560
 goes to the hangar and goes to the 11th fragment in 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.840
 piggy bank of our today's hero well 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.610
