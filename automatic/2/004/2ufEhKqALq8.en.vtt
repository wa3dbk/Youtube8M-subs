00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
stir really well this part is quite

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.210 
stir really well this part is quite
tricky<00:02:05.149> because<00:02:05.539> there<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.289> very<00:02:06.590> fine<00:02:06.950> line

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
tricky because there is very fine line

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.359 
tricky because there is very fine line
between<00:02:07.429> caramel<00:02:08.149> color<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.569> black<00:02:09.019> color<00:02:09.369> so

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
between caramel color and black color so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.100 
between caramel color and black color so
if<00:02:10.549> you're<00:02:10.789> not<00:02:10.970> very<00:02:11.209> experienced<00:02:11.959> with<00:02:12.080> it
