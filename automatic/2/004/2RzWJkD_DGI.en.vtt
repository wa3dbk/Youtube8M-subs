00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.690 

in<00:00:05.980> this<00:00:06.610> section<00:00:06.850> I'm<00:00:07.710> playing<00:00:08.710> rhythm<00:00:09.130> under

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
in this section I'm playing rhythm under

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.959 
in this section I'm playing rhythm under
a<00:00:09.730> solo<00:00:10.150> section<00:00:10.630> so<00:00:10.960> I<00:00:10.990> designed<00:00:11.590> it<00:00:11.799> to<00:00:12.400> have

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
a solo section so I designed it to have

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.510 
a solo section so I designed it to have
the<00:00:13.090> energy<00:00:13.539> build<00:00:13.869> to<00:00:14.320> start<00:00:14.619> very<00:00:14.980> sparse

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
the energy build to start very sparse

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.900 
the energy build to start very sparse
and<00:00:15.820> then<00:00:16.360> build<00:00:16.660> it<00:00:16.810> up<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:17.199> frenzy<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:17.949> I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
and then build it up to a frenzy and I

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.750 
and then build it up to a frenzy and I
started<00:00:19.360> with<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.810> very<00:00:20.080> lush<00:00:20.740> sound<00:00:21.130> playing

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
started with a very lush sound playing

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
started with a very lush sound playing
an<00:00:22.300> E<00:00:22.600> sus<00:00:25.440> with<00:00:26.440> the<00:00:26.530> flat<00:00:26.770> seven<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.310> open<00:00:27.610> D

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
an E sus with the flat seven the open D

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.389 
an E sus with the flat seven the open D
going<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.920> an<00:00:30.550> F<00:00:30.970> power<00:00:31.270> chord<00:00:32.190> and<00:00:33.190> then

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
going to an F power chord and then

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.490 
going to an F power chord and then
adding<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.969> G<00:00:34.210> open<00:00:34.450> string

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
adding a G open string

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.940 
adding a G open string
and<00:00:37.250> then

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.080 

I<00:00:40.980> got<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.470> five<00:00:43.710> starting<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.790> G

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
I got the one the five starting on G

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.700 
I got the one the five starting on G
with<00:00:45.900> a<00:00:46.260> six<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.100> ninth<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.350> each<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
with a six and a ninth and for each of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
with a six and a ninth and for each of
these<00:00:49.830> I'm<00:00:50.250> doing<00:00:50.760> tapping<00:00:51.420> harmonics<00:00:52.020> where

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
these I'm doing tapping harmonics where

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.440 
these I'm doing tapping harmonics where
I'm<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.800> octave<00:00:53.520> higher<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.030> tapping

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
I'm going an octave higher and tapping

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'm going an octave higher and tapping
out<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.720> exact<00:00:55.080> same<00:00:55.260> shapes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.330 

doing<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.160> four<00:01:07.400> times<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.890> dropped<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
doing that four times and I dropped the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.450 
doing that four times and I dropped the
whammy<00:01:10.580> pedal<00:01:10.700> at<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.090> end<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.420> one<00:01:11.660> just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
whammy pedal at the end of this one just

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.630 
whammy pedal at the end of this one just
for<00:01:13.460> some<00:01:13.670> extra<00:01:13.790> salsa<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:16.280> that's<00:01:16.460> four

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
for some extra salsa so that's four

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.450 
for some extra salsa so that's four
times<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.180> then<00:01:17.300> I<00:01:17.330> kick<00:01:17.600> into<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.460> rhythm

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
times and then I kick into a rhythm

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.560 
times and then I kick into a rhythm
distortion<00:01:20.210> sound<00:01:20.560> where<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.800> it's<00:01:22.250> just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
distortion sound where it's it's just

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.890 
distortion sound where it's it's just
basically<00:01:23.570> power<00:01:23.870> chords<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:25.720> start<00:01:26.720> with<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
basically power chords I start with the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.590 
basically power chords I start with the
downbeat<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.470> then<00:01:27.710> up<00:01:27.950> beats

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.350 

and<00:01:34.600> then<00:01:35.050> I'm<00:01:35.380> taking<00:01:35.980> just<00:01:36.700> double<00:01:37.060> stops

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
and then I'm taking just double stops

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.170 
and then I'm taking just double stops
after<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.780> hit<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:40.560> again

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.310 

and<00:01:46.180> then<00:01:46.270> every<00:01:46.570> other<00:01:46.600> time<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:46.990> have<00:01:47.290> a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
and then every other time I have a

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.320 
and then every other time I have a
different<00:01:47.710> riff<00:01:47.980> for<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> turnaround<00:01:50.130> that's

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
different riff for the turnaround that's

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:05.099 
different riff for the turnaround that's
palm-muted

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:15.550 

then<00:02:06.109> I<00:02:06.229> get<00:02:06.409> into<00:02:06.710> an<00:02:06.829> eighth-note<00:02:07.100> groove

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.430 

I<00:02:15.620> do<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.520> twice<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.120> then<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.480> kind<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.050> add<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
I do that twice and then I kind of add a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.490 
I do that twice and then I kind of add a
skip<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:20.090> second<00:02:20.569> two<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.170> four

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
skip to the the second two of the four

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:37.660 
skip to the the second two of the four
of<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.250> eighth<00:02:22.400> notes

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.520 

and<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:38.970> get<00:02:39.120> into<00:02:39.390> full<00:02:39.599> sixteenth<00:02:40.200> notes

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and then I get into full sixteenth notes

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.350 
and then I get into full sixteenth notes
and<00:02:40.829> instead<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> playing<00:02:41.700> power<00:02:41.939> chords<00:02:42.000> I'm

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
and instead of playing power chords I'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.819 
and instead of playing power chords I'm
just<00:02:42.569> playing<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> single<00:02:43.290> notes<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
just playing the single notes and the

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.380 
just playing the single notes and the
bass<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.069> playing<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.610> exact<00:02:44.909> same<00:02:45.120> thing

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
bass is playing the exact same thing

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.069 
bass is playing the exact same thing
with<00:02:45.569> me<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.829> at<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> end<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.540> bars<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.019> do

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
with me and at the end of the bars I do

00:02:49.079 --> 00:03:03.790 
with me and at the end of the bars I do
a<00:02:49.290> scale<00:02:49.590> climb

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.220 

the<00:03:04.550> second<00:03:04.880> time<00:03:05.000> around<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.540> go<00:03:05.810> up<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.020> flat

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
the second time around I go up a flat

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
the second time around I go up a flat
five<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.940> kind<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.210> leads<00:03:08.390> back<00:03:08.780> into<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.320> e

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:35.110 

the<00:03:25.250> last<00:03:25.460> time

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.270 

and<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.269> soon<00:03:36.420> as<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.510> hit<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.689> e<00:03:37.069> it's<00:03:38.069> just

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and as soon as I hit the e it's just

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.149 
and as soon as I hit the e it's just
dead<00:03:38.519> silence<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.799> kind<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
dead silence so that's it's kind of a

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.409 
dead silence so that's it's kind of a
powerful<00:03:41.640> way<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.819> ending<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.659> little<00:03:42.810> frenzy
