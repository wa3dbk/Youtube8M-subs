00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 Nine people I want to go back when they get there 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.470
 and as you can see the new update 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 there is no winter outside no 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.660
 snow more and there are new things and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.510
 Although two hero skills once the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 bap went can now can the himself 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.480
 now that's iron fist and how 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.610
 make it stronger or something and that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.649
 works like crazy when the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 then conjures a few train 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.199
 or something like that do not have it yourself 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.670
 I'll try that with you now 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.410
 do 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 and yes I have my poor camp 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.260
 spent the night 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
 that gets pretty over the top 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 be because two packers a kite 23 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 usd at level 5 and ernie la 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.360
 I probably should 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 Creating a base means leaving is on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.280
 07 this upgrade will be on level 5 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 unlocked and all five levels 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 made stronger so the biking complained 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.439
 has, as I said its ground and the archer 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 queen makes herself invisible i know 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.869
 not exactly how long because I'm the boss 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.420
 am also myself have not you indeed 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.180
 not tested but complained 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 then a few archer you then 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.350
 help 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.350
 and besides, there is a jam box this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330
 pont as well as the trees and the bushes here 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 I do not know how many 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.630
 guess we 'll be 20 to 50 years old 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.369
 maybe we'll see one and yes 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 we could see I have 35 again 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.049
 million gold again a bit 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.710
 danger 37 million elixir and almost 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.720
 10,000 days is my minion here 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.560
 I just rescued three days ago 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.729
 with 10,000 days here because I thought 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.439
 me yes why not maybe we can 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
 next time with the band strategy 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.939
 I will attack again 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.280
 show and then I search my trade 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.810
 Seek my pace can not attack 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.560
 try with you the iron fist and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.560
 we'll meet Again 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:14.390
 ok so we have a base 007 with 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.069
 125,000 gold and 211,000 elixir unfortunately 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.950
 of course knows a lot but what should I do 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.810
 wants you only on the whole the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.489
 showing iron fist from the button 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.750
 I do not think so either 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.810
 packers and the kite need because 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:32.540
 just two windows I'm in nothing 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.959
 and in the meantime what can come up and the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.959
 a defense 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 nothing is distracting and then try 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 not even after the fans tried 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.650
 with the set from the tech not if it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.030
 now a baker and a few shines 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:02.610
 therefore the viking and yours for the old 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.769
 the cinema is ok and the ap is his name 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.959
 brings track that are in his environment 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.959
 also in the workshops to 1 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.190
 then we can have a kite 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:22.290
 groups of you have to actually 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:25.530
 alone I can do it again and again 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.530
 here an overview 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.240
 So yes, the button has just this uk 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.860
 circle around that means you always have to 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.370
 Take a caravan with you if you can 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.310
 activated so that it always brings him 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.650
 good to remember 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.650
 I do not know why she died 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.569
 you have a better one better than me 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:55.439
 thought but I think my 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:04:03.950
 if I said then maybe 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:03.950
 still happen as if we want to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.360
 also look 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.209
 those like me who wanted to 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.580
 I think it still has to do with me 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:28.740
 the six addition, I believe that he 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.740
 although I probably the good here 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.300
 ok, if all gold was brought to you 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.030
 Setting 84 percent is enough for us 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.430
 are enormous and do not care 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.500
 much about the toffees 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.690
 yes i can in a strip anyway so 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.180
 countries 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.440
 yes that is going elixir 200,000 and 120 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.930
 years gold so yes as seen if the 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.220
 Goods are very interesting from the bug 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.120
 So always take a few train and 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.710
 what are you actually saving in now? 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.590
 seven hours my tesla is ready 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.060
 with the 3.6 million gold bought me 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:14.080
 I therefore believe one thing in I 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.250
 believe a tesla parade and yes that 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.250
 what we see
