00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.910
 Welcome to the meantime 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.340
 Ten edition of my top 17 Julia tricks 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.410
 and apps that are just compatible with ios him 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.820
 and I want you today 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.370
 show five tweets 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.380
 These are all free or start 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.470
 directly with the first one this hot there 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.480
 and allows us to be a dark one 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.820
 get keyboard so i have now 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.129
 all the notes as an example youtube 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.800
 stand and you see the keyboard is 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.140
 black and that everywhere it is in all 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.030
 There are various apps thieves open there 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 right now this black keyboard i 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.739
 I'm no longer on the ios 7 beta 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.890
 17.1 later but back to 704 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.140
 gone back and that's why it is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.610
 black keyboard anyway not there the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.649
 was also in the second beta again 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.020
 but then you can remove them 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.420
 reinstall on your device 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.180
 the next war is called blur bar 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.130
 and is a suite for the status bar 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.930
 and you might be fine with that 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.689
 now see that the status bar 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.909
 is also transparent and we are there 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.619
 I can go through a bit 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.789
 blurry and I find that very much 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.679
 Cool even if I'm here now 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.209
 pull up apps and that works in 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.170
 all apps so synonymous if you the 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.999
 settings or in any 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.549
 other apps are then you have 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.200
 these bloggers and that they are really whole 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.039
 Cool out is free in Cydia 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.560
 available 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.399
 next, you want to continue from 2 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.229
 imagine 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.139
 You may already see that mine 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.359
 font style here is completely different whether 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:39.819
 I form in the keyboard or somewhere 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.950
 wants to write something everywhere is too 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.869
 changed my font in the lockscreen 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.969
 and that works with just continue 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.359
 gone and now became the second version 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.340
 released for a steam and unfortunately 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.840
 will be the first version with me at least 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.349
 that was installed but you go 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.359
 just here in the second and here 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.819
 can you then either individual 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.619
 font downloads in 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.479
 which we go through here on and 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.380
 then you already get suggestions for 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.479
 different categories and then you go 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.430
 you in cydia will be sent there and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.080
 install the whole and then find 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.700
 you already here the individual 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
 writings and I now have the winners 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.250
 then the backup is always the one selected 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.950
 font the before 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.210
 So yes, my case was the ci 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.030
 standard font I could do now 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.910
 restore your device as jumps 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 once and otherwise if you do not have one there 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.870
 different fonts are out there 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.030
 just in julia once from 1 or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.500
 Look at google and then you can 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.170
 which also install 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.400
 the next one is called sharp and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.959
 is located in the first 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.030
 settings after reading this 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.100
 We have to install this there 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.660
 then also activate by activating that 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.550
 activate all here and then you can 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.370
 We choose something we do quickly 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.750
 want to open from the homescreen and 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.130
 I have the example here now 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.620
 attitudes taken you can there 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.630
 take some experiment and if 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.360
 you now pull aside where earlier 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.830
 spotlight was there with ios 5 and 16 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 you now this bar and if you 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.280
 pulls far enough then opens the 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.020
 app that is completely no matter which 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.550
 i can also accept trains and 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.630
 already that opens then I think 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.520
 really very cool 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.140
 So you can have your favorite app there 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.540
 place and if you only once 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.190
 very briefly pulls to the side then opens 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.459
 These are really cool 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.870
 is available for free in cydia 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.820
 the fifth and last tree is called 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.170
 messages customizer is located first 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.540
 once in the settings on the we 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.489
 have the whole installed and this 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.590
 trick allows us to be ours 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.590
 messager so our news app 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.030
 can adapt little with different 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.110
 colors so you can now the sms 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.489
 change bubbles 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.320
 here I have that in that case 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.480
 whole money then we can send a message 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.580
 I have changed red here now 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.410
 and if others can and write that 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.370
 We also adjust then so there 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.410
 I have some here now, too 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.230
 Just choose color and then 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.829
 we have a few others 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.239
 setting options, however 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.530
 not so important and if I am now 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.250
 to go to news 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.549
 Do you see if I write myself 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:08.000
 then that's just sent in from me 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.519
 shown in red and I got that 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.049
 now here in such a light blue and 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.549
 we can just tweet this through this 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.160
 change I think looks pretty cool 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.709
 In any case, they were great 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.220
 my top 5 tricks here in a row now 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.079
 10 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.479
 I hope you enjoyed doing me 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.240
 always looks inverted at 2 o'clock so 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.340
 14 clock today on a canal over because 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.330
 There I will then my 10,000 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.409
 to publish subscribers special 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.389

 I would like to have fallen here

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.270
 you could in the comments 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.129
