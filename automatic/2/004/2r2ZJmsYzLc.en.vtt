00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.400
 or 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.130
 you know that the Romans called Spain 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.070
 Hispania, which is the land of rabbits 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.160
 Spanish fields are full of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.490
 bunnies besides there they play run 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.980
 they jump they mark their territory they pass it 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.510
 well it 's an animal that runs a lot and 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.670
 that does a lot of exercise and what 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.650
 you need and what we have to do 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.019
 us at home because a little the same 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.420
 leave at least one hour of exercise 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.719
 that hour of exercise can be done in 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.450
 the living room of the house on the terrace or in the 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.160
 park in the garden or in the field there is 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.260
 have a series of recommendations 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.030
 minimum for each site but only what 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.289
 you're going to spend with them great so I 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 you go and let's see it 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.330
 we are already inside the house in the living room 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.540
 be very careful with the cables with the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.939
 indoor plants and by places 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.670
 where they can get in and we do not 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.830
 we can take out appliances and other 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.619
 they are not a good idea so I think the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.409
 living room or a room where there is 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.680
 no cables, no plugs is a 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.680
 good place 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.780
 on the terrace, be very careful with the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.780
 outdoor plants there are some plants 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.120
 that are toxic to them and also 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.280
 be very careful with jumps that can 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.610
 walk and that they can get in by 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 drain or where they can fall 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.530
 towards from an important height 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.930
 then nothing always very controlled and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.440
 having to be a place where you see everything 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440
 what they can do 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.860
 order a lot they play a lot they 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.260
 they exercise eat plants so 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.410
 great the grass can take it without 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.150
 very careful problem with the fertilizer and 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.330
 only precaution against parasites 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.970
 external you have to put a pipette to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.450
 that do not catch ticks 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.080
 fleas and other insects that can damage 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.460
 therefore the garden a place 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.700
 Exceptional to have fun with your 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.700
 pet
