00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.709
 Good day today I will show you 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.570
 how to refill the cartridge by example 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.570
 cartridges and g37 s 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:20.950
 canon mp190 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:25.150
 in order for us to fill it you need 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:31.240
 carry this syringe syringe 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:35.559
 10 vat such and ink can in this 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.079
 case, I will refill only with the card 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.850
 with black color ink i won't 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.620
 refill because i don't use it 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.309
 but the principle is absolutely analogous only 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.499
 the main 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.280
 confuse with flowers for now more 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.559
 I 'll explain it all for a start 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.609
 turn on the printer 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:02.370
 turn on push the substrate and open 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:10.750
 cover with glass 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:12.990
 we wait while cartridges will drive off to the left for them 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.990
 extraction 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.930
 Iâ€™ll basically refill ink 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 because I don't have a cartridge yet 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.140
 ended in principle, I think no one 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.280
 hurt if such a one hundred percent 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.970
 visibility will not be here to 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.090
 remove the cartridge you need to push it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.700
 down taught chock and you can already calmly 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.270
 drink it ahead 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.320
 quietly without touching your hands for 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.050
 contact group and nozzle also put 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:03.310
 to touch nothing also 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:07.149
 we take out everyone as I said 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.149
 pj 37 and 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.600
 738 color cartridges as you can 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.600
 see on 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:26.360
 black and white remind black each with 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.750
 black ink missing sticker i 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.910
 ripped off for easy access to the hole 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.560
 to through which just we will 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.640
 refill color cartridge each 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.920
 also present 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.250
 these holes here you can see them 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.549
 will tear off the sticker but I think everyone 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.549
 there are not clearly seen these three 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.549
 holes also if you we need you 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.120
 will refill the cartridge 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:59.120
 rip off the sticker and also refill in 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.690
 On the Internet, you can find a scheme 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.900
 flower arrangements 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.730
 I will not exactly lie if I saw 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.930
 insert a photo at the end 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.310
 what colors are arranged to not 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.140
 confuse so postpone this side 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.500
 imagine for not have been fill as already 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.660
 spoke a syringe will just think that he 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.290
 already filled insert 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:37.620
 into the hole about half after that 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 how do we feel what he found in the sponge and 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.340
 squeeze the syringe completely gradually 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:52.300
 not very fast to be fed 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.810
 that the tuple managed to feed on not 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.140
 poured down 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:03.100
 from the top you can when you squeeze 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:07.630
 syringe and gradually pull it out for 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.690
 greater even distribution throughout 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.420
 cartridge generally imagine that we have already 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:21.450
 squeezed out take it out into place and in 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:27.940
 reverse order everything was done in principle 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:33.180
 also we put a station here 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.180
 just forward and up. 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:46.050
 also flower put it up ahead and 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.050
 Shevchuk up went all right 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:56.530
 close the printer forgot to say 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.280
 recommends turning it off before replacing 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.570
 in principle, it never did it to me 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:08.710
 did not interfere with the printer works properly as 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.010
 I worked not turned off never never 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.750
 I never turned off the printer when I changed 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.900
 college then there are no problems with that 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.680
 I did not recommend myself 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.310
 replacements 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.800
 hold this button to reset 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.770
 settings i also kennedy i have a principle 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.889
 arrange there will then be written that 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.189
 you 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.289
 empty cartridge but this is no problem 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:36.349
 not to force it can be put away 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.569
 The Internet is full description of how to remove this 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:43.629
 mistake and such 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:47.569
 This property is what when the cartridge 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:49.969
 change if you start typing right away 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.189
 most likely you will have bands 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.060
 lines that is as if you have paint 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:58.999
 has ended 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:02.330
 as if badly printed so here not 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:06.469
 take your time worrying do deep 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.469
 cartridge cleaning juices is somehow called 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:15.349
 don't remember exactly in general take full 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:20.629
 course technically for your printer and 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:24.770
 after that will print the printouts 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:26.289
 quite qualitatively quite well can 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.259
 someone will be a video is useful and 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:32.240
 I apologize that everything is not so decomposed 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:38.379
 on the shelves and not very high quality 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.379
 as it turns out only good
