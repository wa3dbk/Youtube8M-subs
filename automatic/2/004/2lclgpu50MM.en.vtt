00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 nice guys then hydra and today i'm here 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.980
 with a new video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.080
 then guys like I announced 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 yesterday, today, from port to nawar against 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 of the Italians as I said it was 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 enough braggarts and let's see 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.330
 meanwhile the reason as you see in the in the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 comment after seeing that they were account 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.070
 of Italians have written typicality 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 sucks the shell and how we go to 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.000
 see result the compass sucked 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 someone else but let it go immediately 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.189
 this speech is very far away 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.679
 from the war and how you see these here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.050
 they had two town halls at 10 they all had 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.840
 the municipalities at 9 while we all had 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 the municipalities at 90 to 10 so we had 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 also two municipalities on 8 so it was a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 love that from the beginning seemed like a lot 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.629
 difficult but we still managed to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.520
 get by as usual ship of the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 better attacks anyway attacks 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.539
 that I liked more if we go to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.660
 see as a first attack to see 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.370
 this slip of lexus on their first like 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.219
 see this here was a town hall at 10 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.070
 passed by not very much I think but had 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.799
 he had the third arc x and the editor 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.470
 hell and I'm mostly here in the end 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 author hell are those who do 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 make a town hall at 10 especially in 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.470
 war because that every municipi ix that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.409
 attacks do not have the sky to shoot a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 hell and they are the most annoying thing 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.780
 surely the slip has decided to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 sticking with golem magicians and witches with 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.659
 8 hot air balloons we say held at the end 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.040
 to make the percentage usually 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 tonight fell to make three 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.790
 stars also h 9 but the one used for 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.400
 do the two 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.860
 look here guys at the effect of di 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.780
 one of the two new emotions that it succeeds 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 easily to destroy all the troops 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.200
 of the clan or in any case very faithful 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.000
 very serious 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 the crus with a very good jump that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.630
 centers in the center of the village and therefore 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 also targeted by the two towers 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.579
 hell and therefore having no stake 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.229
 manages to take the star of the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.299
 town hall thanks to the reggina if not 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 look at the golems guys how many 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.009
 how many strokes absorb the acs anyway 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 to the very high 25th heroes even if to a 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.170
 municipal 9 succeeds by skill 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.090
 take the star on the town hall 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.790
 little the final balloons succeed in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 taking the two stars also had a 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.430
 maghetto we say at the end if not 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.580
 wrong was also enough 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.860
 lucky to get the two stars at 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.440
 at the end he puts the magician in a place 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520
 best was 46 percent thinks there 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.930
 thinks pretty well before 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.230
 position to that position in a 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.840
 deadlock where there were 34 let's say 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.970
 exposed buildings without defenses 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.680
 so he manages to make 50 percent a 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.840
 excellent attack by slip laps that you 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.560
 I repeat municipality ix against municipi al 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.830
 10 now let's go see either 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.269
 this here maybe from our eighth 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.739
 I had not seen this little girl see 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.290
 the whole of our eighth against the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.040
 their second hub is this that boys 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.150
 it is not even town hall there is let's call it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.390
 City Hall bo 78 10 all together had 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.110
 one two towers hell however attached 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.330
 with congo wipe indeed with you wii is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.980
 still managed to make two stars 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.980
 we also speed it up because this 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.570
 before it had quite low defenses 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.320
 he immediately takes a fury, however, voters 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.079
 hell give much trouble though 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.540
 although he was a town hall at 9 though 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.320
 can easily expect the two 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.120
 stars as we see now not certain 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.769
 as you can see, in the end it even succeeds 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.280
 to get close to 100 percent 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.720
 sets about 80 percent of the attack but 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.690
 then it fails to go further 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 a good fast attack anyway 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.900
 let's see some more 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.870
 attack maybe a little bit above 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.070
 don't live this three stars maybe 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.739
 to know if it's from our dal 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.590
 our fourth against their pinto or a 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.959
 see this which was a t h 9 well put 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.600
 the game apart from the walls of the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.030
 walls boys are fundamental 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.030
 you have a municipal 9 like that though 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.620
 we don't say have the walls of level 7 is 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.340
 quite useless because when you do 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.840
 stick with a tactic as it works 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.420
 easy enough to take the three stars 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.890
 also thanks to the walls it is not easy 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.720
 take three stars but the walls 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.340
 they benefit a lot from their opponents 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.890
 that will put us a lot less 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.420
 destroy the walls and then look 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.920
 to close the village 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.950
 you see there are always those 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.300
 hot air balloons at level 6 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.520
 we tell my companions almost all of them 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.860
 use to search for three stellar i's 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.650
 adversaries and above all seeing that the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.040
 witches are really a lot better than 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.530
 pac 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.360
 in most cases here as 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.850
 see you can easily re-enter 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.650
 center of the village with let's say 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.400
 all the heroes with all the witches 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.080
 all the wizards and nothing looks anyway 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.090
 with the balloons at the end of all the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.930
 adversary village is very successful 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.810
 very well 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.250
 still had a golem alive and 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.620
 nothing therefore speed up by now 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.990
 the attack that goes straight towards the hundred 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.280
 percent 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.080
 here it is that we are now waiting 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.270
 let the three stars come out on the 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.890
 background, here they are like a three star not 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.050
 I even find it very difficult 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.340
 advanced almost all the witches 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.500
 reggina with the maximum of life 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.000
 therefore an excellent educator attack 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.160
 now let's go to see one last 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.750
 attack maybe a little bit more on e 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.280
 there is another three-star well otherwise go 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.960
 to see with or at least to see a two 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.940
 stars maybe see this here by betu 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.440
 ok this is ok though and well done 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.990
 a different tactic attached with a 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.630
 laval union with with the queen had the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.840
 primacy trade let's see where it decides to 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.840
 attack 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.080
 ok instead of sticking in the part 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.460
 superior and not used all 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.200
 badly used ballooning holds back a 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.240
 little bit we say too much to dashes 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.660
 I think he could put them all together 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.460
 but in any case it has been successful 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.010
 in fact he will be able to make two stars like 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.080
 we saw the problem at the beginning 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.640
 guys to stick with only with 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.620
 this tactic hardly comes 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.130
 one hundred percent because if I didn't love 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.690
 immediately the reggina is almost certainly you 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.830
 will destroy all the balloons and 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.570
 so do the one hundred percent will be 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.220
 really very difficult 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.710
 as you can see they had also left three 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.530
 maghetti from clan troops but with 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.979
 with the thugs with the account reggina is 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.419
 managed to make him the two stars here 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.850
 first with 50 percent enough 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.140
 easy then look at the reggina that is 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.360
 opens in the town hall 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.830
 indeed it does not destroy the town hall with 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.290
 the reggina gr because with an outgoing balance 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.940
 from the king beard it doesn't seem to me then with 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.440
 the henchmen even if struck alone do not 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.120
 manages to take the second star 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.860
 so guys I hope that anyway 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.540
 there is this work against Italians 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.160
 liked invitation to leave a nice one 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.540
 I like a nice comment if you have any 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.100
 done to this you have to channel and ne 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.760
 we have to do it tomorrow with a video pitch 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.760
 of the laga
