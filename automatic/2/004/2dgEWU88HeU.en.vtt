00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 hello today we are so bright 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.810
 neon 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 I have already prepared a summer water manicure 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.719
 on what water manicure I have a base 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.849
 her white forehead as a dream but also basic 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.329
 participants of today's water manicure 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.110
 this lacquer pipe drink baby from the collection 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.910
 on one vegas swatch you see very 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.460
 it was hard for me to get them because 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.590
 they are not international delivery thank you 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.530
 to everyone who helped me get them all the same 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.470
 I certainly understand that not everyone has it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.510
 bright collection so you calmly 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.310
 can not use it and desperately 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.140
 glace for dance legend 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.750
 They are great for water 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.190
 manicure the only thing that today I do not 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.460
 I will use this varnish 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.950
 a little bit out so bright for her 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.170
 these six varnishes we will today 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.890
 soak apply protection to the skin around 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.170
 nails 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.500
 if you don't have it clearly you are calm 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.790
 replace it with duct tape 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.560
 Links will be below if you still 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.570
 want and buy i will give you 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.350
 Russian counterparts that are not 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.970
 dear and also work fine i don't 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.560
 I can say that I use water in 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.260
 room temperature because we have 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.880
 already heat you are 27 degrees outside and 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.030
 accordingly the water in the pipes is very 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.299
 warm i put two pieces of ice on 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.820
 cup disposable 200 milliliters but 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.799
 again this is all yours individually 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.729
 water should be a little cool and 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.619
 so add paws drop by drop 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.900
 if you have plitonite 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.370
 on the side of it that means too high 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:59.920
 hold 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:03.010
 brush with lacquer and a little more and that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.880
 I got 18 drops of each la 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.880
 casa 3 drops 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.780
 start drawing 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.920
 I wipe my needle after each 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.920
 drawn line 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:31.940
 don't like come on the other hand already 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.940
 it is better 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.520
 turn the cup you like 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.920
 side of the picture and so that you were 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:50.520
 convenient to lower and gently omit 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.350
 finger 100 to the poison and to the surface what 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.410
 it was grabbed by the film then it will be 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.700
 easy to remove and take out completely 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.209
 neatly our task neatly 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.340
 remove protection give a little picture 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.560
 dry out and then we will test 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.450
 leftovers 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.450
 i use acetone flat brush 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.600
 you probably think I'm finished 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.370
 Lacomaniac and I can spend 18 drops 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.340
 lacquer just to make a design on 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.140
 one nails here and not if you 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.080
 I wonder how I did it continue 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.970
 look and so what I did exactly 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.060
 also made a drawing 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.010
 and gave him to dry for 20-30 minutes 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.790
 now gently pull it out of the water 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.280
 and scissors cut 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.310
 I cut the film and now with these 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.100
 blanks will work stick our 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.220
 we cut off the billet on top remove all 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.220
 superfluous 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:10.180
 it remains to fix the design top and 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:12.040
 manicure ready i used the coil but 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.990
