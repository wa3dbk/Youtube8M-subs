 here in the option is what we have 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:31.150
 if you look and we immediately took us 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.150
 our position is worth our calendar 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.209
 here it tells us that in the tax you value the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.930
 taskbar that does not teach them that 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.650

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.590
 I'm going to give you one more clue that I also use 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.250
 the aero glass so that it is hereby 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.820
 transparent vale 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.780
 to see here that nothing else this does not 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.500

 when we started windows 7 by gates 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.160
 and this so I do not like it 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.680
 language we see that we only have English 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.190
 we apply here we have the format of 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.490
 hours than 24 hours 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.150
 here we go to the location 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.560
 we already have it but for example 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.560
 If we want Barcelona 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.480

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.300
 where this more than everything he does is 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.550

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.550
