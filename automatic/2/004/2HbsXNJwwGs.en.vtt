00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I'm using Nyx's jumbo pencil in milk to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.719 
I'm using Nyx's jumbo pencil in milk to
just<00:01:39.570> help<00:01:40.530> everything<00:01:40.829> adhere<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
just help everything adhere it's kind of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.080 
just help everything adhere it's kind of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
parts relatively boring so I'm not going

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.600 
parts relatively boring so I'm not going
to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.450 
to
too<00:01:49.880> much<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.360> yeah<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:51.050> happened<00:01:51.440> next<00:01:52.280> I'm

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
too much of it yeah it happened next I'm

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.040 
too much of it yeah it happened next I'm
going<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> take<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:53.000> transitional<00:01:53.600> color<00:01:53.810> this

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
going to take a transitional color this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.810 
going to take a transitional color this
is<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.230> deep<00:01:54.590> beige<00:01:54.950> from<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.370> palette<00:01:55.790> and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
is a deep beige from the palette and

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.940 
is a deep beige from the palette and
just<00:01:56.210> place<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:56.510> in<00:01:56.750> my<00:01:56.870> crease<00:01:56.930> even<00:01:57.890> though

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
just place that in my crease even though

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.530 
just place that in my crease even though
it's<00:01:58.130> not<00:01:58.250> terribly<00:01:58.610> obvious<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.270> little

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
it's not terribly obvious it's little

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.850 
it's not terribly obvious it's little
things<00:01:59.750> like<00:01:59.870> this<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.440> make<00:02:00.680> or<00:02:00.830> break

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
things like this that can make or break

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.670 
things like this that can make or break
a<00:02:01.070> makeup<00:02:01.570> I'm<00:02:02.570> going<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.930> begin<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.290> map<00:02:03.470> out

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
a makeup I'm going to begin to map out

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.410 
a makeup I'm going to begin to map out
my<00:02:03.830> petal<00:02:04.190> shape<00:02:04.430> with<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.790> deep<00:02:05.120> green

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
my petal shape with this deep green

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.290 
my petal shape with this deep green
eyeshadow<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.350> small<00:02:06.710> angled<00:02:07.220> brush<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
eyeshadow and a small angled brush and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.200 
eyeshadow and a small angled brush and
I'm<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.420> going<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> take<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.229> along<00:02:09.619> my<00:02:09.920> eye

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
I'm just going to take that along my eye

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.760 
I'm just going to take that along my eye
it's<00:02:11.210> kind<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.540> difficult<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.990> explain<00:02:12.080> this

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
it's kind of difficult to explain this

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.380 
it's kind of difficult to explain this
shape<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.310> think<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.820> terms<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.300> a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
shape but just think of it in terms of a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.080 
shape but just think of it in terms of a
petal<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.020> want<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.980> be<00:02:16.100> rounded<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:16.820> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
petal you want it to be rounded at the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.630 
petal you want it to be rounded at the
inner<00:02:17.330> corner<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.990> kind<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.530> come<00:02:18.770> up<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
inner corner and kind of come up at the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.510 
inner corner and kind of come up at the
end<00:02:19.790> almost<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> big<00:02:21.380> wing<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:22.430> I'm

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
end almost like a big wing then I'm

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.340 
end almost like a big wing then I'm
gonna<00:02:22.640> trace<00:02:23.000> from<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.330> lower<00:02:23.540> lash<00:02:23.810> line<00:02:23.840> up

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
gonna trace from my lower lash line up

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.790 
gonna trace from my lower lash line up
to<00:02:24.560> meet<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.740> top<00:02:25.160> line<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.940> connect<00:02:26.360> them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.199 

then<00:02:33.800> I'm<00:02:33.890> gonna<00:02:34.010> begin<00:02:34.370> filling<00:02:34.670> them<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
then I'm gonna begin filling them in and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.910 
then I'm gonna begin filling them in and
deepening<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.900> want<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> have<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> nice

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920

deepening it I want it to have a nice
dark<00:02:37.430> color<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:38.540> gonna<00:02:38.690> mix<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.080> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
dark color to it so I'm gonna mix in a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.320 
dark color to it so I'm gonna mix in a
little<00:02:39.170> bit<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.500> black<00:02:39.770> as<00:02:40.100> well<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.670> just<00:02:41.180> want

it to be a nice frame for the rest of
the<00:02:43.640> colors<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.400> very<00:02:49.610> difficult<00:02:49.820> to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
the colors it can be very difficult to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.060 
the colors it can be very difficult to
get<00:02:50.300> pastel<00:02:50.780> colors<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.260> show<00:02:51.440> up<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:51.800> took<00:02:51.980> a

just on the lower port part of my lid
and<00:02:56.390> over<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.590> put<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.950> mint<00:02:58.280> shadow<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.790> a

little<00:03:08.120> bit<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.330> shine<00:03:08.540> from<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.350> other<00:03:09.500> so

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
little bit of shine from the other so

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.580 
little bit of shine from the other so
it's<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.920> nice<00:03:10.070> combination<00:03:14.230> next<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.320> took<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
it's a nice combination next I took a

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.140
