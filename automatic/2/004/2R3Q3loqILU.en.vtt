00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.300
 I'm right back 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.889
 then often standing have often stood 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.330
 People asked exactly the rules

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 so how do I win one of us? 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.039
 is captain first so are the state 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.320
 of course and the worst as well 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.330
 best rating falls out and out of the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.539
 three scores stay here is divided 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.550
 and one is an exact question wishes 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.719
 for example 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.989
 pixmania do what comes here comes one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.399
 one point one stroke one a yes that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.600
 is difficult to say if put 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.520
 simply scores points for everyone 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.050
