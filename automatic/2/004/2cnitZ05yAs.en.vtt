00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
waiting on lines for a couple people I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.250 
waiting on lines for a couple people I
got<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> special<00:01:54.119> guest<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260

that<00:01:55.890> person<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.400> of<00:01:56.430> town<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:57.150> figured

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
that person is out of town so I figured

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.610 
that person is out of town so I figured
probably<00:01:58.470> take<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> minute<00:01:59.130> but<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:01.470> probably

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
probably take a minute but it probably

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.740 
probably take a minute but it probably
won't<00:02:01.800> be<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.040> Tuesday<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.540> definitely
