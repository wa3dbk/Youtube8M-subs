00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
further but we're gonna turn this into a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.350 
further but we're gonna turn this into a
shrub<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.340> we're<00:01:31.430> gonna<00:01:31.520> do<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.790> very<00:01:32.060> very

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
shrub and we're gonna do this very very

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.390 
shrub and we're gonna do this very very
simply<00:01:32.840> by<00:01:33.170> adding<00:01:33.350> some<00:01:33.650> apple<00:01:34.130> cider

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
vinegar so for every three parts of your

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.180 
vinegar so for every three parts of your
rhubarb<00:01:37.760> syrup<00:01:38.480> we're<00:01:38.990> gonna<00:01:39.080> add<00:01:39.260> two<00:01:39.800> parts

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190
