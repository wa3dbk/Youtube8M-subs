00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the extreme of using a graphics program

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.820 
the extreme of using a graphics program
like<00:00:20.430> Photoshop<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.779> way<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> do<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.410> using

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
like Photoshop one way to do it is using

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.560 
like Photoshop one way to do it is using
preview<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.490> another<00:00:23.880> way<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
preview and another way to do it is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
preview and another way to do it is
using<00:00:25.170> pages<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.949> own<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.369> work<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.390> let's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
using pages if you own I work so let's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.939 
using pages if you own I work so let's
start<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.810> pages<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
start with pages because your lot you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.759 
start with pages because your lot you
can<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.460> pages<00:00:29.929> of<00:00:30.929> course<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> word

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
can do in pages of course it's a word

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.900 
can do in pages of course it's a word
processing<00:00:32.160> program<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.640> instead<00:00:32.790> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
processing program but instead of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.700 
processing program but instead of
choosing<00:00:33.059> word<00:00:33.360> processing<00:00:33.780> choose<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> page

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
choosing word processing choose a page

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.060 
choosing word processing choose a page
layout<00:00:35.280> template<00:00:35.790> let's<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.960> landscape<00:00:37.890> one

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
layout template let's do a landscape one

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090 
layout template let's do a landscape one
and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.149> let<00:00:39.510> me<00:00:39.600> reposition<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.410> shrink

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
and then let me reposition it and shrink

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.360 
and then let me reposition it and shrink
it<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.239> could<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.010> I'm<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it here so we could see it I'm going to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.500 
it here so we could see it I'm going to
drag<00:00:44.520> from<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> desktop<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:46.100> JPEG<00:00:47.100> file

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
drag from the desktop here a JPEG file

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
drag from the desktop here a JPEG file
let<00:00:48.510> me<00:00:48.600> shrink<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.649> zooming<00:00:50.100> there

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
let me shrink it down the zooming there

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700 
let me shrink it down the zooming there
and<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.899> already<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.500> with

this jpg file on this blank canvas of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
this jpg file on this blank canvas of
course<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> expand<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> fill<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.340> space

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
course I can expand it to fill the space

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.330 
course I can expand it to fill the space
or<00:00:57.379> more<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.500> less<00:00:58.730> and<00:01:00.770> I<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.219> the

of the background now i can use things

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850 
of the background now i can use things
like<00:01:23.310> shapes<00:01:24.020> create<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> circle<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.680> i

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like shapes create a circle there i

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.090 
like shapes create a circle there i
bring<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> inspector<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.590> again<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> i'll

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
bring the inspector in again and i'll

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.109 
bring the inspector in again and i'll
change<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.549> circle<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.689> no<00:01:30.990> Phil<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
change that circle to have no Phil and

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
change that circle to have no Phil and
increase<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.540> line<00:01:34.200> stroke<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.189> i<00:01:35.610> can

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
increase the line stroke there and i can

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
increase the line stroke there and i can
easily<00:01:36.000> position<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> around<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
easily position that around so that it's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.630 
easily position that around so that it's
where<00:01:38.850> i<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.600> i<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.560> continue<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
where i want it to be i can continue to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.410 
where i want it to be i can continue to
use<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:41.970> shapes<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> arrow<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:47.420> put

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
use more shapes like this arrow here put

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.220 
use more shapes like this arrow here put
the<00:01:48.540> arrow<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> other<00:01:49.229> side

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.960 

and<00:01:55.440> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.040> point<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:58.730> I<00:01:59.730> could<00:01:59.880> very

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and have a point to it and I could very

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.560 
and have a point to it and I could very
easily<00:02:00.090> add<00:02:00.510> text<00:02:01.320> boxes<00:02:01.980> as<00:02:02.130> well<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
easily add text boxes as well like this

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:15.920 
easily add text boxes as well like this
and<00:02:07.250> increase<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> size<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.820> that<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.780> that's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and increase the size of that so that's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.560 
and increase the size of that so that's
some<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> basics<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.460> can<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.790> so

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
some of the basics of what you can do so

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.490 
some of the basics of what you can do so
that<00:02:18.690> really<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.020> scratches<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.410> surface

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that really just scratches the surface

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.100 
that really just scratches the surface
because<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.280> use<00:02:20.400> shapes<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.120> text

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because you can use shapes and text

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.490 
because you can use shapes and text
boxes<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.270> variety<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:25.110> different

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
boxes to do a variety of different

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.100 
boxes to do a variety of different
things<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> even<00:02:26.820> add<00:02:27.060> other<00:02:27.330> photos

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
things and you can even add other photos

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.440 
things and you can even add other photos
and<00:02:28.290> images<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.740> top<00:02:29.070> basically<00:02:29.460> do<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> page

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and images on top basically do a page

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.450 
and images on top basically do a page
layout<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.350> photos<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.010> when<00:02:32.340> you're

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
layout with your photos and when you're

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.480 
layout with your photos and when you're
done<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.630> export<00:02:34.380> out<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:37.160> hit<00:02:38.160> export

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
done you can export out and hit export

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.150 
done you can export out and hit export
it<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.750> at<00:02:40.020> PDF<00:02:40.560> which<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> good<00:02:41.100> thing

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it out as at PDF which is a good thing

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.940 
it out as at PDF which is a good thing
to<00:02:41.310> send<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.530> can

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
to send it as and if you like you can

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.610 
to send it as and if you like you can
then<00:02:44.100> convert<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.610> PDF<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.660> image<00:02:46.410> in

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
then convert the PDF to a image in

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.890 
then convert the PDF to a image in
preview<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.880> if<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.090> don't<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.360> pages<00:02:48.630> you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
preview so if you don't have pages you

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.720 
preview so if you don't have pages you
can<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.860> preview<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.580> you

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
can do a lot of this in preview if you

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.670 
can do a lot of this in preview if you
have<00:02:50.850> snow<00:02:51.090> leopard<00:02:51.120> double<00:02:52.110> click<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.440> the
