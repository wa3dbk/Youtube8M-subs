00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 the homemade stuffed tasty and juicy 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.500
 all the secrets 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.940
 but in the end they approve in the end it's before 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.240
 to start we present section 4 in 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.240
 five steps 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.800
 i 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.340
 let's start the dish in five steps 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.530
 cut meat pie blade 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.050
 knife and blades have justice 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.200
 let's start by the mass step number 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:41.070
 one how to make the important mass 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:43.260
 caserita we know that we're not going at all 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 I throw you the quantities per kilo kilo of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.230
 flour 40 200 of fat vaccine and 300 of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.230
 water is well frame 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.270
 I'm going to go through the middle to do it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.210
 faster then remember kilo 200 of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 fat vaccine 300 water barely warm if 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.700
 I ask you a little bit more, you put a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 little more water not so much fat 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.119
 let's add a good spoonful of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.680
 salt is then I got to have the grace that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.410
 tremendous taste we are going to the work 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.590
 let's move on exactly the water is 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.520
 a little warm we are doing 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.520
 homemade empanadas 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 it's a fusion between empanadas de 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.190
 the whole country has enough onions 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.780
 we took that from mendoza and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.600
 successively we will go telling of what 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.820
 the water flour hand is barely 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:42.020
 warm melted fat that is still 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:44.479
 it is barely warm much fat and a 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190
 spoonful of fine salt salt I'm 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.520
 making eye but putting a spoonful 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.520
 flush 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.080
 we are doing step number 1 how 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.430
 make a delicious mass that you say 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.420
 I do not forget more about why it is so 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.610
 rich empanadas 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.409
 not only because this juicy also where 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.300
 you're up there also because of the mass 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.670
 because if the difference 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.080
 let's fill up the dough we're going to make 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 a stuffed meat cut knife 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.940
 but with typical matambre declared more 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 super super rich but apart we take what 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.230
 best of all degrees since of tucumÃ¡n 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.660
 we remove the matambre and this one among others 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 I'm going to mix things up a little bit 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 I will teach the secret so that you 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.720
 they remain super juicy is made but very 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.580
 very very juicy and apart from all that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 let's learn to re thumb let's see 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.360
 how the oven has to be a lot 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.240
 of things on this plate in five steps in 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.880
 this case empanada of cut meat is 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.740
 a national company that is rich that are 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.600
 the empanadas I think it 's the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:50.300
 empanadas while all this for you to 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:50.300
 how are we connected 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.280
 Well, mixing all this 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:15.920
 and now let's get a little bit of 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:18.230
 we put manito the dough is just do 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.270
 the mass of 5 to make the best 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.400
 rich rich rich empanadas when I go to 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.330
 take text it's time to go down to the counter 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.330
 and knead activate it 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.930
 I remember the amount of matches and what 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.550
 are you watching I hope I'll stir the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.240
 amount to see you recognized is 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.459
 I do not love you reading 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.180
 well I'm kneading well since I'm going to 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.180
 give a little more 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.830
 how was the water without lukewarm 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:04.530
 when he said do the questions but 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:06.390
 the question of whether you are sending several 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.370
 cuts so that eye to see what happens 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.860
 the behind the scenes does not know the disgust 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.870
 in front of calabrese pay attention to 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.120
 the recipe that I'm doing and I do not 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340
 ask things that I already said and the guy what 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.820
 first they ask me what I repeated 744 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.150
 times 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.290
 Juan Ferrara is my friend of the soul in 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.290
 the room inside the water 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.180
 perfectly without any problem but 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.160
 If you lower the temperature a bit 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.780
 it's too hot the water is going 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.820
 to start cooking the flour and you 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.320
 they look good is not that they look bad but 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.919
 I prefer that it is not so hot 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.919
 good 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.520
 we also have a new chapter of 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.789
 as 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.710
 all the wine comes the world of wine 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:11.750
 which is part of the food because the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:14.669
 Argentine national drink is the post 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.470
 I finished kneading and finished then 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:22.550
 this step number how much is missing 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.550
 we feed we are returning immediately
