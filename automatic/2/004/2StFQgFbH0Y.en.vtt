00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.359
 so I thought about appearance and aesthetics 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.999
 for the good port this imaginary version 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.149
 even the hood and the wings 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.279
 and briand 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.949
 better mass 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.609
 no trace 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.169
 apparent fingers 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.839
 so know it and pretty much have a lot of matches the criteria in fact 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 but with a little more and go for it so we'll go to the side part 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.429
 left 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.349
 the beast 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.110
 Devedjian 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.960
 a usb port the network port 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.580
 half carry 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 the displayport 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 and for the reader the multicar 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.260
 who accepts 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200
 also the memory stick 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.930
 I'm at dawn 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.210
 and last 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.540
 the pot to the roses 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 salient elsewhere 13 94 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 United Nations 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 the unfortunate air extraction 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910
 this is how 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 the right side with the two usb ports 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.290
 more classic 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.290
 the left and a microphone jack 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780
 claude soula 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 so we can see by not eating for this level of attacked 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.410
 the plaque 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.900
 poor france 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.009
 he noted precisely to the excesses while custom floors 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 the situation for calligraphy 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 current goes inside 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.400
 so the screen are good the screen the keyboard seems 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.110
 good bill 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.760
 do not scream frankly shine 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 we are entitled to a beautiful surface match 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 youth no trace of a trackpad 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.859
 texture 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.289
 they are also happy 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.289
 very very good 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.509
 in euros the classic keyboard 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.199
 but with the help of the keys or 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.139
 arrows 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.139
 normally positioned to last 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.249
 so whose function keys with the key the p6 which allows 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.409
 to pass the map 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.399
 the customer 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.019
 Ã  la carte music 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.239
 so it's too much 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.239
 it may be a bad surprise goodbye 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.609
 so we're going to a screen 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.599
 brilliant and you can see 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.750
 kepler 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.309
 very very very pray that m 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.779
 but I hope we are going very bright 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.339
 what love can realize that the reflections are monstrous 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.849
 do not say dramatic 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.789
 really that's the big big black dot 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:15.459
 i think the fee will be turned over could more leave me a 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 year 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 the choice between Dalmatian is a poet 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.849
 so the lit jul see what it gives
