 With this powder is difficult to make a mistake because 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.250
 she is absolutely transparent she as such 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.120

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.890
 coffee 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.290
 really she lays down thinly-thinly with a veil and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.340
 and not visible on the skin or not difficult 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.840
 well, not reality is not with borschts and she 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.270
 there are different kinds of punch up to different 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.890
 species there are more brilliant not 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.229

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.010
 brilliant little with nacreous 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.890
 I didn't want to take the finish 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.780
 which is a bit like highlighter 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.120
 because now these all sparkled 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.420
 I want that the same is neutral 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.040
 the effect of it is difficult to show on camera 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560
 there are reflective particles 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.860
 small small small if you look at 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.750
 the sun yes they gleam slightly 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.239
 but the eye is almost invisible 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.180
 just creates an effect in trading 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.019
 even healthy skin by the way my tone 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.420
 called the coward is so glad that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.850
 finally i have this here specifically 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.250
 the acquisition also appeared change 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.709
 spoke in the video about the correction zone 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.519
 around the eyes about the magic tool from 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.030
 benefit is called that means smelled 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.150
 life 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.390
 if I am correct and reread it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.200
 here's a thing in such a tube which, if 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.250
 apply 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.190
 to the area 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.910
 under the eyes and around the eyes it brightens 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.610
 and aligns there visually all our 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.240
 shortcomings written that this express 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.410
 glitter funny thing this 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.360
 can be applied with a brush 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.250
 applied under the eyes and as a result of the skin 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.000
 around the eyes this means is lightened 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.070
 a bit is made more even and even I 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.350
 would say she moisturizes a little 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.500
 the skin under the eyes in this thing is contained 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.170
 silicones and due to these silicones she 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.370
 it is exactly that that levels the skin 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.670
 good for the feet I'm of age and is 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.480
 the remedy fits well with other remedies 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.790
 concealer same to more such 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.910
 pigmented if you really 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.130
 there are bruises under your eyes or something 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.640
 any such already knowing sneaks all that 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.739
 pleasing this remedy in itself their not 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.320
 will correct completely she won't remove 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.770
 just slightly brightens the skin under 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.390
 my eyes like that 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.760
 you will yell but me so with 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.049
 childhood butchers under the eyes and this one 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.769
 one thing won't help me 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.780
 accordingly put this means 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.840
 from benefit and already imposed on it 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.060
 from above can see I bought a remedy for 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.650
 rouge bunny rouge 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.080
 eye zone corrector 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.479
 called whisper fan I took myself 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.900
 the very light of latinas there barely have dinner in one 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.630
 the other way is faster for me 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.610
 he has a little brush on this side 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.950
 probably like many concealers 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.930
 I tried to use it too 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.729
 seemed cool my color ok i 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.680
 picked up myself because I have skin 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.210
 light and accordingly the brightest 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.400
 I took the color myself and before that I 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.820
 enjoyed many years concealer from mary 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.650
 kay 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.560
 and I was already so tired he was more like that 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.050
 he gave more yellowness and it did not end 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.950
 did not end did not finish ended with me 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.590
 just wanted 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.200
 terrible is already something new and one more of 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.340
 Pros Yes, as Lina said this is what he 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.780
 well pigmented then it is real 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.420
 uncovers bruises and 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.560
 other problems there 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.490
 colors i acquired that clinic i 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.150
 used only two times 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.720
 mascara called high impact mascara 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.000
 mascara impact of scurvy is a mascara which 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.990
 also Leno told about it praised 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.370
 what does she make cilia like that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.440
 what do you need 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.610
 natural at the same time their good 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:36.330
 I can see I will show mascara brush 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.120
 Here is such a mesh mesh pretty 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.030
 yet voluminous quite thick and comfortable 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.919
 make-up convenient to paint eyelashes 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.580
 she shares them very well not 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.850
 glues I will say right away for those girls 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.030
 who like the effect of doll eyes 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.100
 effect eyelashes 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.850
 terry such dreams that are seen for 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.310
 kilometer 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.729
 this one won't give you that effect 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.630
 also will give the opposite cilia such will 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.660
 natural but at the same time very good 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:13.830
 she will but every day will hold 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.450
 good and probably for special occasions on 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.050
 the output is better to use others 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.490
 products of other carcasses which are more 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.100
 accentuate your eyelashes further i 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.370
 I will show a product that has become legendary 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.900
 this is such a pencil from willow 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.530
 such a light pink pencil and 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.729
 told me that this is just her mast hev and 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.039
 told all his charms on the very 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.169
 What is this pencil for? 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.310
 order to exhibit certain 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:43.410
 plots in particular this is internal 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:47.580
 eye shelf as it is called 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:51.120
 I think one line is the corners of the eyes 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.510
 this is the corner of this tick on the top 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.070
 lip in general on the brow and so on 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.600
 this is what you need to brighten may 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.729
 any folds or wrinkles can 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.560
 brighten me too madly 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.570
 previously used another pencil 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.180
 would all allow more so he was 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.729
 whiter is pink coastal color 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.490
 so natural colors on our skin 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.409
 and he keeps himself very well on the water 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.240
 eye lines almost everywhere not 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.809
 hold out of course you can correct 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.490
 in the late afternoon but he doesn't move out there not 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:22.860
 rolls into the corners of the eyes like this often 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.449
 happens at least longer pretty 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.879
 than how we used ours 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.199
 hold on, too, I find it successful 

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.689
 by the way by the acquisition of this pencil 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.849
 I had a long run around men I 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:35.879
 found it and very pleased I bought myself 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:38.580
 Here is such a brush brought it cost 

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:41.249
 full of 280 rubles such a budget option 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.279
 This brush is artificial to nylon 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:45.149
 called on the brush to apply 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:47.099
