00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
6 1 2 3 &amp; 4 5 &amp; 6 so the foot positions

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
6 1 2 3 &amp; 4 5 &amp; 6 so the foot positions
for<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.489> step<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.149> will<00:00:45.750> show<00:00:45.929> from<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.640> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
for this step I will show from here is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.630 
for this step I will show from here is
right<00:00:47.940> foot<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.559> left<00:00:49.559> foot<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.039> place<00:00:50.070> right

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
right foot back left foot in place right

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.540 
right foot back left foot in place right
foot<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:52.109> close<00:00:52.170> left<00:00:53.100> foot<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
foot to the side close left foot to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.599 
foot to the side close left foot to
right<00:00:53.760> foot<00:00:53.909> right<00:00:54.809> foot<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> side<00:00:55.609> left

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
right foot right foot to the side left

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.180 
right foot right foot to the side left
foot<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.030> place<00:00:57.059> close<00:00:57.739> right<00:00:58.739> foot<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:59.010> left

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
foot in place close right foot to left

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.869 
foot in place close right foot to left
foot<00:00:59.510> left<00:01:00.510> foot<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.960> side<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.649> now<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.550> can

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
foot left foot to side and now we can

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
foot left foot to side and now we can
start<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.239> from<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> beginning<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.040> back

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
start it from the beginning so it's back

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.289 
start it from the beginning so it's back
in<00:01:05.700> place<00:01:06.799> right<00:01:08.090> close<00:01:09.140> right<00:01:10.399> left<00:01:11.399> clothes

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
in place right close right left clothes

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.410 
in place right close right left clothes
left<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> jive<00:01:15.450> Chasse<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> side

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
left so the jive Chasse is to the side

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.620 
left so the jive Chasse is to the side
close<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.350> side<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.969> trust<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
close and side and the trust me to the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.679 
close and side and the trust me to the
right<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:23.040> clothes<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.210> right

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
right with the right clothes and right

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.120 
right with the right clothes and right
so<00:01:25.619> giant<00:01:26.070> basic<00:01:26.399> step<00:01:26.640> consists<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.299> three

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
so giant basic step consists of three

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.300 
so giant basic step consists of three
parts<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.759> first<00:01:29.790> part<00:01:30.149> is<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> rock<00:01:30.810> back

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
parts the first part is the rock back

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.029 
parts the first part is the rock back
which<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.719> right<00:01:33.719> foot<00:01:33.960> back<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> left<00:01:34.829> foot

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
which is right foot back and left foot

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.850 
which is right foot back and left foot
in<00:01:35.189> place<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.780> first<00:01:36.990> chasse<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
in place and the first chasse to the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.959 
in place and the first chasse to the
right<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> second<00:01:41.159> chasse<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
right and the second chasse is to the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.779 
right and the second chasse is to the
left<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> when<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> practice<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.759> should

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
left so when you practice you should

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.179 
left so when you practice you should
always<00:01:45.090> try<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.539> practice<00:01:46.170> these<00:01:46.590> small<00:01:46.950> bits

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
always try to practice these small bits

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190 
always try to practice these small bits
and<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.180> sure<00:01:48.359> of<00:01:48.539> yourself<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and when you are sure of yourself you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
and when you are sure of yourself you
can<00:01:49.409> put<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.740> together<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.909> dance

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
can put them together and you can dance

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
can put them together and you can dance
the<00:01:51.299> whole<00:01:51.420> basic<00:01:51.840> step<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> once<00:01:53.399> more<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.640> will

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the whole basic step so once more I will

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.649 
the whole basic step so once more I will
show<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
show you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.469 
show you
it's<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.320> two<00:01:56.159> three<00:01:56.969> ten<00:01:57.390> four<00:01:57.780> five<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.920> six
