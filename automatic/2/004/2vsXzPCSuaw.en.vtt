00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.960
You have always been my missing piece

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.180
now that I've found you I can't get no, sleep

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:33.220
but I wanted, to say, just how you make me feel

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.380
so here I go, you're a dream that just turned real

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.320
You're all I want, you're everything I need

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.900
when I think of you, it's you're love that sets me free

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.940
everything's gonna be just fine,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.880
I can't believe that you're mine all mine

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.440
never really too far away to say,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.700
with you boy, there's no more rainy days

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.200
I just can't get enough of you

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.000
maybe we can run away like teenage lovers do

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.680
but I wanted, to say, just how you make me feel

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.500
so here I go, you're a dream that just turned real

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.760
You're all I want, you're everything I need

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.980
when I think of you, it's your love that sets me free

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.060
everything's gonna be just fine,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.000
I can't believe that you're mine all mine

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.520
never really too far away to say,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.600
with you boy, there's no more rainy days

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.660
But I wanted, to say, just how you make me feel

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.960
so here I go, you're a dream that just turned real

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.740
You're all I want, you're everything I need

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.340
when I think of you,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.980
it's you're love that sets me free

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.140
everything's gonna be just fine,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.960
I can't believe that you're mine all mine

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.400
never really too far away to say,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:40.740
with you boy, there's no more rainy days

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.120
I hope you want to support me through Patreon,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.320
or my own support site

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.680
Or buy something in my web shop, like my CD, or DVD

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.000
It would help me a lot to keep making music videos.
