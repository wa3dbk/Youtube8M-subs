00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
dragon element of ice element of dark

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.140 
dragon element of ice element of dark
and<00:02:32.260> element<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.740> war<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.430> let's<00:02:33.610> try<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.820> place

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
and element of war so let's try to place

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.020 
and element of war so let's try to place
the<00:02:34.420> dragon<00:02:34.840> into<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.830> habitat<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.790> take<00:02:37.000> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the dragon into the habitat to take a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.670 
the dragon into the habitat to take a
look<00:02:37.270> at<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:37.780> here<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:40.530> let's<00:02:41.530> just

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
look at it so here it is and let's just

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920 
look at it so here it is and let's just
move<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.220> habitat<00:02:42.790> over<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.239> bit<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.870> can

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
move the habitat over a bit so you can

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.350 
move the habitat over a bit so you can
see<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:46.270> a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
see it there it is it's it's a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
see it there it is it's it's a
relatively<00:02:46.840> big<00:02:47.230> dragon<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:47.860> about<00:02:48.010> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.460 
to the final form now and take a look at
that<00:04:45.430> all<00:04:46.430> right<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.270> dragon<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:47.900> huge

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
that all right so this dragon is huge

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.920 
that all right so this dragon is huge
just<00:04:48.590> look<00:04:48.890> at<00:04:49.010> him<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.280> he<00:04:50.210> charges<00:04:50.630> up

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
just look at him and he charges up

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.400 
just look at him and he charges up
righty

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
righty

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.909 
righty
immediately<00:04:52.390> so<00:04:53.390> he<00:04:53.570> kind<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.900> sucks<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.530> like

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
immediately so he kind of sucks in like

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.390 
immediately so he kind of sucks in like
blue<00:04:55.910> aura<00:04:56.300> mana<00:04:57.110> whatever<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.800> want<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:58.160> call

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
blue aura mana whatever you want to call

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.390 
blue aura mana whatever you want to call
it<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.729> then<00:04:58.760> he<00:04:59.360> blas<00:04:59.750> is<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.400> that's

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
it and then he blas is it that's

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.219 
it and then he blas is it that's
essentially<00:05:01.970> it<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.300> mean<00:05:02.630> that's<00:05:02.810> what<00:05:03.050> he's

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
essentially it I mean that's what he's

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:16.120 
essentially it I mean that's what he's
doing

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.670 

all<00:05:17.130> right<00:05:17.310> we're<00:05:17.460> gonna<00:05:17.550> exit<00:05:18.030> out<00:05:18.180> there

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
all right we're gonna exit out there

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.240 
all right we're gonna exit out there
here<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.770> is

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
here it is

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.480 
here it is
yeah<00:05:21.180> on<00:05:21.780> me<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.020> think<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.470> Dark<00:05:22.740> Elf<00:05:22.979> dragon

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
yeah on me I think the Dark Elf dragon

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.680 
yeah on me I think the Dark Elf dragon
is<00:05:23.610> small<00:05:23.940> or<00:05:23.970> something<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:25.110> he<00:05:26.060> yeah<00:05:27.060> it's

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
is small or something is he yeah it's

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.080 
is small or something is he yeah it's
probably<00:05:27.900> because<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.860> Dark<00:05:29.160> Elf<00:05:29.400> dragon<00:05:29.940> is

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
probably because the Dark Elf dragon is

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.090 
probably because the Dark Elf dragon is
small<00:05:30.389> but<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:31.020> course<00:05:31.350> this<00:05:31.440> dragon<00:05:31.889> is

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
small but of course this dragon is

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.159 
small but of course this dragon is
slightly<00:05:32.669> bigger<00:05:32.940> than<00:05:33.030> other<00:05:33.360> dragons<00:05:33.870> even

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
slightly bigger than other dragons even

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.290 
slightly bigger than other dragons even
the<00:05:34.500> Zen<00:05:34.740> dragon<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.340> Zen<00:05:35.639> dragon<00:05:36.090> is<00:05:36.150> like<00:05:36.270> a
