00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.530
 but as a nation these rights of man 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.280
 teacher and the belief in a natural right 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.590
 used leaders transcends all concrete right and that that expression of a 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.939
 universal moral 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.640
 the affirmation of the activity the individual 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.050
 Above all, the Latino community that lives 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.880
 consistent affirmation 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 directly from the liberal idea of ​​the universal man 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.990
 the belief in the existence of a human being independent of all 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.609
 concrete determination 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 Spaceship vote for him 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.390
 that is to say 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.600
 the primacy of this man over historically situated men 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.440
 profile there is to import at the time that belongs to man 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.490
 Paleolithic art is made 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.660
 the Neolithic 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.980
 the average age for modernity 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 he always had his rights 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.290
 the same would fit for the geographical situation of the same 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.150
 the universalist and cosmopolitan mentality 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.780
 considers the human species as an undifferentiated unit 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.070
 with respect to the current 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 all belongings to a civil society full session 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 it's an accident that can be overlooked 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.850
 nothing was different, for example 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.530
 as a young Norwegian 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.870
 Acid content agreement 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.700
 except 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.200
 small differences that rights times can be ignored 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.060
 universal 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 that both have from the day they are born 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.200
 The Quindío must necessarily know and implement their 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.440
 natural human rights the medium of the jungle in which the interest 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.159
 If these rights 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.420
 they are universal 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.470
 must be aware of their right to vote 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.800
 It is your right to divorce even if you do not know that act 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 even right to freely choose his sexuality 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.340
 all these or topics that are contained in a clear and explicit way the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.480
 original formulation but fear its historical egalitarian 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.250
 evidently 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.790
 both liberals and progressives agree in this speech 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.879
 equality of men as value and supreme human right is not questioned 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.440
 philosophical larraín de amozoc tanto 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.169
 it's the same 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.549
 these two ideologies twinned by a common origin forlán thus what 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.549
 we call system 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:39.189
 already in the 18th century until the 20th century entered the hegemony of egalitarianism 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.579
 sheput strengthening little by little 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.059
 but before so much harmony 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.179
 what was missing 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.409
 an enemy is missing 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.029
 an absolute enemy before the Cuenca and maintain the biological unity that 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.249
 does similar 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.499
 this enemy was represented 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.900
 by the emergence in European culture of a new trend 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.019
 former interista 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.229
 that would crystallize new politically and culturally 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.229
 and European union movements 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.209
 is the war against the identity and nationalist culture 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.719
 when egalitarianism found its final synthesis under the banner of 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.759
 human rights 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.819
 the entire second half of the 20th century served to expel all waste 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
 ideological and all incident mouth 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.129
 in this sense we understand the famp between repentance as always 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.509
 changes of opinion and psychodrama the progressives the last decades 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.389
 in search of a communism of human face 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.619
 of an ideal purged finally of all order and cooked revolutionary 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.629
 of all genocidal impulse eto'o authoritarian temptation 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.489
 1989 years of the fall of the berlin wall 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.029
 and bicentennial of the French Revolution 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.519
 will therefore represent the date of the triumph of the doctrine of rights 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.509
 of man 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.749
 as a new secular religion of the system 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.400
 the brothers and biological 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.979
 they finally made the hug 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.179
 has placed them to the globalist tyranny 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.179
 as we know her and the couple 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:28.429
 having been definitely elevated toby are of morals of our times 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.949
 the religion of the rights of man today celebrates its triumph and its expansion 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.930
 planetary 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.890
 ideological virus for its capacity to destroy ethnic diversity 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.240
 this allegedly universal morality 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.560
 provides the ideological armor aume or colonialism that filled today with 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.979
 justification a devastating cocktail of angeli caricuao the police 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.080
 trying to impose a particular moral standard on all peoples 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.120
 the revision of the rights of the man tries to return to give good consciences 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.909
 to an accident prey to decadent materialism 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.620
 allowing one more time to be established as a role model and denounce as 

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.619
 barbarians to those who reject it 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.270
 the destruction of the bear towns also from here 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.270
 by the planetary imposition of the few cyclists 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.539
 that having undermined the values ​​of the West through the 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.169
 disintegration of all organic bond 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.339
 from all the rest of the community 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.339
 goes in search of the destruction of other civilizations 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.210
 in that way we have become familiar with the discourse that under the pretext of 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.520
 protect the rights of Muslim women 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.589
 against the alleged machista impositions of the Koran 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:49.309
 the champions of human rights justify wars of invasion of 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.309
 those countries to release the weaker sex 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.050
 obviously I know that that would be religious political reality 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.689
 which has led, among others, to the fashionable conservative revolution of Islam 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:05.389
 in which we already had women have been those that have encouraged the use of the veil 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.749
 religious 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:10.330
 all that does not seem to matter 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.710
 the imperialism of human rights is not questioned 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.980
 and is legitimized so much the course course of followers and fanatics of the 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.990
 progressive techniques such as fundamentalists of the pentagon
