way long twelve and a half inches this
way<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.900> then<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:44.100> six<00:04:44.699> and<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:44.910> half<00:04:44.940> inches

way and then it is six and a half inches

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.439 
way and then it is six and a half inches
deep<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.979> pretty<00:04:47.370> much<00:04:47.669> fit<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> good

particular<00:04:51.240> space<00:04:52.199> right<00:04:52.500> here<00:04:54.620> then<00:04:55.620> it<00:04:55.800> does

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
particular space right here then it does

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.120
