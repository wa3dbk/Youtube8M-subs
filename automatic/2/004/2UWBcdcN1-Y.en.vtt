 as well as a 2 0 victory over tadic bodies 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.949
 the Austrians currently quite 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.800
 badly coped with on the last day in 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.989
 lost league 10 against admira wacker 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.100
 quote of 17 just before 2 1 victory 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.460
 over storm graz on the first day of play 1 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.810

 as well as a 3 2-victory of grödig against 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.939
 austria vienna 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.590
 zenit a single on the first day of play 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.869
 bag for you can exhibit against 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.380
 atlético madrid weak performance of my 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.380
 opinion, the Brazilian 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.670
 Striker midfielder how to get him 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.369
 He often plays in the right 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.710
 midfield through the more cashed 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.759
 Go ahead zenit currently the last 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.500
 group 3 to 1 gates as I said austria 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.310
 Vienna tied in third place 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.219
 at a goal 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.270
 As you can see zenit has this season 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.569
 always shot many goals 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.569
 in 12 33 the here 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.959
 or three of the five placed or 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.819
 listed players here with each 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.780
 four goals is good, too 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.109
 like to stand ready for a goal against 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.930
 madrid 3 by so wiethoff 1 conceded by 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:37.019
 spartak moscow 2 conceded so defensive 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.510
 he is not all that gold right now 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:45.950
 of course zenit now shines too 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.010
 example with old bavaria player 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.230
 timoshchuk again or arshavin too 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.780
 at zenit or to pull those too 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.819
 but returned to the point 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.389
 I think that the points in 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.909
 Russia I stay mine is it 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.939
 artificial turf in Petrovsky Stadium and 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.549
 that's why i think austria is there too 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.949
 by now also less 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.019
 technically technically studded player 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:17.400
 there are a few problems in the beginning 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.939
 becomes and therefore in the end with 2 0 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.939
 to lose
