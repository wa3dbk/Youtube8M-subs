00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
because he thought that some people

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.480 
because he thought that some people
might<00:01:19.609> be<00:01:19.759> embarrassed<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:21.530> talk<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.219> others

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
might be embarrassed to talk to others

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.660 
might be embarrassed to talk to others
or<00:01:22.850> wouldn't<00:01:23.659> know<00:01:23.719> how<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.930> be<00:01:24.350> social<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.490> so

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
or wouldn't know how to be social and so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.419 
or wouldn't know how to be social and so
that<00:01:26.030> way<00:01:26.149> all<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.299> time

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.370 

so<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.149> is<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.929> gives<00:01:30.049> people

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
so this is not that it just gives people

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.169 
so this is not that it just gives people
something<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.799> throw<00:01:30.950> at<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.100> fan<00:01:31.310> yeah<00:01:31.939> yeah
