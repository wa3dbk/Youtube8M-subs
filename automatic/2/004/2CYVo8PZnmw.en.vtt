00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
here we have the micro Maxine at 220

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.500 
here we have the micro Maxine at 220
regional<00:00:21.960> languages<00:00:22.470> macro<00:00:23.160> max<00:00:23.369> Brown<00:00:23.670> dying

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510

yeah<00:00:28.279> to<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> back<00:00:29.550> we've<00:00:29.849> got<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.140> list<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
yeah to the back we've got a list of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.709 
yeah to the back we've got a list of
highlights<00:00:33.079> available<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.170> four<00:00:34.410> colors<00:00:35.719> so

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
highlights available in four colors so

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:48.470 
highlights available in four colors so
let's<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.680> knife<00:00:46.980> D<00:00:47.480> so

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
let's so here we have the knife D so

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.139 
let's so here we have the knife D so
let's<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.680> bit<00:00:49.789> what<00:00:50.789> else<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.120> we

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
let's get to it in a bit what else do we

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
let's get to it in a bit what else do we
have<00:00:53.899> both<00:00:55.160> use<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> guy<00:00:56.489> warranty<00:00:57.360> god<00:00:58.219> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
have both use a guy warranty god the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.439 
have both use a guy warranty god the
channel<00:00:59.910> booklets<00:01:01.730> we<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.149> thousand

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
channel booklets we have a two thousand

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.000 
channel booklets we have a two thousand
milliamp<00:01:03.660> hour<00:01:03.930> battery<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:06.500> guess<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
milliamp hour battery I guess this is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:18.920 
milliamp hour battery I guess this is
similar<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.580> phone<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> canvas<00:01:17.930> here

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
similar to one phone on the canvas here

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.929 
similar to one phone on the canvas here
we've<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:20.000> micro<00:01:21.000> USB<00:01:21.030> cable<00:01:24.619> your<00:01:25.619> phones

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
we've got a micro USB cable your phones

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.450 
we've got a micro USB cable your phones
anomaly<00:01:26.939> might<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.689> anyone's<00:01:28.320> visit<00:01:29.250> over

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
anomaly might be anyone's visit over

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:41.569 
anomaly might be anyone's visit over
there<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> wall<00:01:39.360> adapter<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> that's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
there and the wall adapter so that's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.300 
there and the wall adapter so that's
pretty<00:01:42.030> much<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.540> let<00:01:42.750> me<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.960> put<00:01:43.310> these

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
pretty much it so let me just put these

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.960 
pretty much it so let me just put these
contains<00:01:44.729> aside<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:46.729> unite<00:01:47.729> -

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
contains aside and we get about unite -

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.830 
contains aside and we get about unite -
so<00:01:48.720> here's<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> unite<00:01:49.530> -<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> back<00:01:51.630> we've

so<00:02:57.540> 4.7<00:02:58.260> inch<00:02:58.410> display<00:02:58.470> WVGA<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.700> means<00:02:59.940> 800

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so 4.7 inch display WVGA that means 800

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.559 
so 4.7 inch display WVGA that means 800
pixels<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.500> ver<00:03:01.739> 480<00:03:02.670> pixels<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.329> way<00:03:03.510> if

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
pixels this ver 480 pixels this way if

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.140 
pixels this ver 480 pixels this way if
that<00:03:03.930> gives<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.950> unite<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> pixel<00:03:05.700> density

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
that gives the unite to a pixel density

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.300 
that gives the unite to a pixel density
of<00:03:06.590> roughly<00:03:07.590> 200<00:03:08.040> pixels<00:03:08.340> per<00:03:08.519> inch<00:03:08.549> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
of roughly 200 pixels per inch so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.440 
of roughly 200 pixels per inch so
alright<00:03:11.310> let's<00:03:11.519> see<00:03:11.730> how<00:03:11.849> much<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.180> weight

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
alright let's see how much this weight

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.140 
alright let's see how much this weight
weighs<00:03:12.870> an<00:03:13.079> app<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:15.829> 157<00:03:16.829> grams<00:03:16.859> that's<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.819> bet

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
weighs an app so 157 grams that's a bet

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.050 
weighs an app so 157 grams that's a bet
on<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.450> hefty<00:03:18.989> side<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.650> feels<00:03:20.040> solid<00:03:21.500> so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
on the hefty side but it feels solid so

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.449 
on the hefty side but it feels solid so
this<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.389> plastic<00:03:25.519> mmm<00:03:26.660> that's<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
this is plastic mmm that's it so the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.250 
this is plastic mmm that's it so the
display<00:03:29.849> looks<00:03:30.299> pretty<00:03:30.930> good<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.380> far<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:34.230> is
