00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.240
 welcome i am thin stripe frames for 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.620
 draw well dotcom I want to start 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.940
 this video asking you a question 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.350
 what is the color 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.560
 the color does not exist is not really a 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.630
 characteristic of an object but a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.800
 subjective appreciation of our 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.320
 perception that color is a 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.890
 sensation of our brain to see 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.690
 certain materials an object is not 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.540
 red or green or blue and so on but who 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.820
 we perceive it of those colors 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.980
 our visual and cerebral system 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.190
 interpret the light reflected by 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.040
 things we go that the color actually 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.990
 is in the light with what can be said 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.330
 that light is color 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.970
 in sunlight called white light 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.900
 is actually composed of six 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.660
 different colors red orange yellow 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 blue and violet green are those that form 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.510
 the rainbow but only three of these 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 Six colors are the main or 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.560
 primary the red the green and the blue if 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 we mix these three lights you get the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.890
 white if there is no light the result is the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.780
 black to the magic players 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.260
 will be familiar this combination of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.290
 colors is not like that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.930
 if we mix the primary ones with each other 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.350
 couples we will get the so-called colors 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 secondary 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.080
 but if an object does not have color itself 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.360
 how is it that I perceive it 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.340
 all materials have the property 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.710
 of absorbing certain range of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 radiation of light and reflect another 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.260
 Part the color of the object that you perceive 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.710
 is given by the colors of the spectrum 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.390
 luminance of light that are not absorbed 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.789
 for the object but they are reflected 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 let's give an example imagine that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.750
 you have this beautiful in front of you 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.460
 redesign of the famous superhero's helmet 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.180
 of iron that I have made 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.870
 because you perceive different colors 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.969
 by giving me the white light that is the six 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.909
 colors cited above that basically 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.969
 are the three primary green red and blue 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:36.239
 over this area of ​​the helmet you perceive it 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.189
 red but because red what is 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.530
 happening here is that this kind of 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.389
 material is absorbing the waves of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.239
 the light that correspond to the green and the 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:48.030
 Blue keeps them for himself but not the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.689
 that correspond to the red that rejects them 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.659
 or reflect them with what you only perceive 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.889
 the red of all the light that gives you why 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.889
 you see it in this color 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.910
 this area here instead absorbs the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.120
 blue waves and reflects or rejects the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.440
 red and green that if you remember together 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.440
 they form the yellow 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.170
 if we see this toad for example in 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.659
 reality what happens is that the material 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.659
 from which your skin is made absorbs 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.609
 authorizations of the color red and blue and 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.840
 repels or reflects the greens 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.360
 that's why you perceive green 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.519
 when you see something white it means that 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.910
 reflects all the colors of the spectrum 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.730
 light all the light do not absorb anything 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.580
 that's why you perceive it white because light 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.650
 it's white and if it's something black 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.160
 it means that it does not reflect anything 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.390
 absorbs all the light for itself so no 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.390
 there is light there is no color 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.420
 hence, wearing dark colors is more 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.060
 hot gives more heat because all that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.569
 light absorbed by the material is translated 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.219
 in accumulated caloric energy dresses 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.799
 white if you do not want to spend a summer 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:11.040
 hot reflects all the light you can 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.290
 or you saw the black to snow lotion if you go to 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.719
 a cold place as the wall will absorb 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.230
 all the light and its heat energy and 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.930
 you will be more to gustito 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.820
 now you know a possible reason why 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.910
 that the night watch dresses 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.910
 black 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.829
 thanks for drawing well
