00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.490
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.500
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.950
 Hello, I welcome very much I 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 they brought something with them 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.949
 Something there in my hand I show 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.619
 it looks like that to them and what 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.930
 is this now big secret to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.390
 nobody knows that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.070
 maybe they come behind it and the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.019
 it looks like a small hole 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 in there hole always means somewhere looks 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.510
 one in or out and one here 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.059
 Camera is exactly that is a tiny 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 small camera small alsfeld 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.090
 card size well a bit thicker 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.450
 but nice small what can the camera now 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.120
 which can be 640 x 480 resolution or one 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.710
 quarter of it and she has one 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 Built-in battery and I can do it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.969
 Just take it like that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.030
 insert a memory card into it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.149
 this place up to 32 gigabytes 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.430
 Can I thread in there and then have 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.590
 I have a USB port because I can do that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 gets to a computer or a computer 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.500
 recharge the supplied power supply 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.000
 and I can dub my recordings 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.939
 on the computer to look at them 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.830
 but that's clear with a camera 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.630
 a father for the mode we come 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.540
 on it and a father to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.100
 switch on when I press longer on 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.799
 then the light-emitting diode goes on 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 and now when I again press then 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.119
 So the recording starts a little 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.829
 camera and what is special now 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.479
 the special is that has one 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.909
 standby time of 90 days not hours 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 meet 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 This camera will be triggered either 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.250
 through noises when she hears something or 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.509
 by rapping anything or anything 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.969
 through a schedule 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.070
 there is a program that we can 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.450
 see us on the screen 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.640
 I can do different things I can 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.560
 once the camera teach the clock 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.950
 I've got different settings 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.530
 in it 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.009
 I can tell her when to take her 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.229
 should 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.569
 in which mode I can say yes 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.579
 with which quality 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.829
 with which resolution and so on and 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.200
 so on at the moment I can program 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.510
 do not operate because the camera is not 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.030
 connected is the must of course 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.889
 They work that way too 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.989
 Do not drive it because it is not only 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.269
 power supplies at but also here so 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.260
 an adapter I put in the socket 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.900
 car can get stuck 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.739
 and behind were usb so that I can 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:41.780
 then charge the camera and then you can 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.129
 Me on a 32 gb card up to 96 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.540
 make hours of recording 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.540
 namely with and for
