number one that bolt that holds that
that<00:00:48.610> camp<00:00:49.270> in<00:00:49.539> there<00:00:49.809> is<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.680> darn<00:00:51.070> long<00:00:51.250> I

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
that camp in there is so darn long I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.360 
that camp in there is so darn long I
don't<00:00:52.690> know<00:00:52.750> if<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.899> get<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.200> cat<00:00:53.469> get<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.070> lake

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
don't know if I get the cat get the lake

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.790 
don't know if I get the cat get the lake
down<00:00:54.579> on<00:00:54.789> it<00:00:54.969> better<00:00:55.180> I<00:00:55.600> will<00:00:56.140> show<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:56.440> blew

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
down on it better I will show you blew

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.560 
down on it better I will show you blew
off<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.219> it<00:00:57.399> but<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:59.500> so<00:00:59.770> difficult<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:01.300> get

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
off of it but it's so difficult to get

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.139 
off of it but it's so difficult to get
at<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:01.930> bolt<00:01:02.829> on<00:01:03.160> that<00:01:03.190> bolt<00:01:03.640> head<00:01:03.910> down

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
at that bolt on that bolt head down

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.300 
at that bolt on that bolt head down
there<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.899> got<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.199> retrieve<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.920> out<00:01:06.070> and

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
there and you got to retrieve it out and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.630 
there and you got to retrieve it out and
kind<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.000> tip<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.570> cover<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.960> little<00:01:08.229> bit<00:01:08.380> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
kind of tip to cover a little bit and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.609 
kind of tip to cover a little bit and
have<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> mindset<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.630> everything<00:01:11.170> has<00:01:11.380> to

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
have a mindset that everything has to

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.030 
have a mindset that everything has to
drop<00:01:11.830> down<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:13.150> can't<00:01:13.479> take<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.990> off<00:01:14.229> going<00:01:14.680> up

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
drop down you can't take it off going up

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.710 
drop down you can't take it off going up
very<00:01:15.990> difficult<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.530> loosen<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.400> cap<00:01:18.640> tip<00:01:19.540> it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
very difficult you loosen the cap tip it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.560 
very difficult you loosen the cap tip it
on<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.080> downward<00:01:20.560> angle<00:01:21.009> slide<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:22.030> bolt<00:01:22.299> oh

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
on the downward angle slide the bolt oh

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.410 
on the downward angle slide the bolt oh
that<00:01:23.290> gets<00:01:23.530> rid<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:23.979> bolt<00:01:24.310> length<00:01:24.759> because

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
that gets rid of the bolt length because

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.200 
that gets rid of the bolt length because
if<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.990> don't<00:01:26.229> take<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> bolt<00:01:26.920> out<00:01:27.159> first<00:01:27.670> it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
if you don't take the bolt out first it

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.480 
if you don't take the bolt out first it
just<00:01:28.479> extends<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.259> far<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:30.280> there<00:01:30.460> just

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
just extends so far that there just

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.789 
just extends so far that there just
isn't<00:01:30.850> room<00:01:31.030> for<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.930> manipulate<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
isn't room for you to manipulate the

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.270 
isn't room for you to manipulate the
whole<00:01:33.159> thing<00:01:33.720> between<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.990> black<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
whole thing between the black and the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.330 
whole thing between the black and the
exhaust<00:01:36.970> manifold<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.290> too<00:01:38.470> tight<00:01:38.710> so

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
exhaust manifold it's just too tight so

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.450 
exhaust manifold it's just too tight so
get<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> bolt<00:01:39.850> out<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.590> cover<00:01:41.799> usually<00:01:42.040> pops

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
get the bolt out the cover usually pops

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.100 
get the bolt out the cover usually pops
right<00:01:42.700> off<00:01:42.759> just<00:01:43.119> give<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.420> little<00:01:43.570> nudge<00:01:43.689> it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
right off just give it a little nudge it

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.859 
right off just give it a little nudge it
hardly<00:01:44.530> ever<00:01:44.680> seal<00:01:45.189> too<00:01:45.549> tightly<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.570> there

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
hardly ever seal too tightly on there

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.100 
hardly ever seal too tightly on there
and<00:01:47.020> what<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.820> disappointing<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.030> me<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.509> that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and what is disappointing to me is that

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.530 
and what is disappointing to me is that
sometimes<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:51.070> run<00:01:51.280> into<00:01:51.909> this<00:01:52.240> situation

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
sometimes I run into this situation

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.240 
sometimes I run into this situation
where<00:01:53.140> they<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.439> a<00:01:53.470> rubber<00:01:53.860> gasket

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
where they have a rubber gasket

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.929 
where they have a rubber gasket
underneath<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.479> rubber<00:01:56.170> seal<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:57.250> really

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
underneath it a rubber seal that really

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.539 
underneath it a rubber seal that really
doesn't<00:01:58.299> conform<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.680> entrance<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.369> that

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
doesn't conform to the entrance in that

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.510 
doesn't conform to the entrance in that
black<00:02:00.909> I'm<00:02:01.270> gonna<00:02:01.869> put<00:02:02.500> another<00:02:02.619> photo<00:02:03.189> up

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
black I'm gonna put another photo up

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.639 
black I'm gonna put another photo up
enlargement<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.540> you'll<00:02:04.840> see<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.380> lower

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
enlargement that you'll see the lower

covers that covers the black at all and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.230 
covers that covers the black at all and
I<00:02:14.470> was<00:02:14.770> getting<00:02:15.010> asleep

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
I was getting asleep

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.630 
I was getting asleep
breath<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.690> stink<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.800> thing<00:02:18.070> for<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> long

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
breath of stink on that thing for a long

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.580 
breath of stink on that thing for a long
time<00:02:18.970> until<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.420> bunny<00:02:19.720> discovered<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.470> this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
time until I bunny discovered that this

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.000 
time until I bunny discovered that this
mechanic<00:02:21.220> who<00:02:21.340> had<00:02:21.570> refurbished<00:02:22.570> his<00:02:22.780> car<00:02:23.080> I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
mechanic who had refurbished his car I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.490 
mechanic who had refurbished his car I
think<00:02:24.520> he<00:02:24.610> put<00:02:24.820> even<00:02:25.180> wrong<00:02:25.390> gasket<00:02:25.990> on<00:02:26.110> we

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
think he put even wrong gasket on we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.740 
think he put even wrong gasket on we
certainly<00:02:26.860> made<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> poor<00:02:27.430> selection<00:02:27.790> because

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
certainly made a poor selection because

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.930 
certainly made a poor selection because
the<00:02:28.930> gasket<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.740> see<00:02:29.980> how<00:02:30.190> dark<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.760> in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the gasket is you see how dark it is in

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.140 
the gasket is you see how dark it is in
the<00:02:31.060> corner<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> lower<00:02:31.900> portion<00:02:32.560> there<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the corner the lower portion there it

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.380 
the corner the lower portion there it
just<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.290> wasn't<00:02:36.010> sealing<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:37.030> any

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
just it just wasn't sealing on any

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.110 
just it just wasn't sealing on any
surface<00:02:37.840> area<00:02:38.260> maybe<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.610> fault<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
surface area maybe it's a fault of the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.750 
surface area maybe it's a fault of the
gasket<00:02:40.840> manufactures<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.800> went<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.340> order<00:02:42.640> to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
gasket manufactures I went in order to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.050 
gasket manufactures I went in order to
new<00:02:42.940> rubber<00:02:43.450> gasket<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.890> gasket<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.790> not

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
new rubber gasket and that gasket is not

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.320 
new rubber gasket and that gasket is not
shaped<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:47.350> cover<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:48.400> surface<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.120> is

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
shaped to cover the surface that is

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.560 
shaped to cover the surface that is
intended<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:51.010> got<00:02:51.610> upset<00:02:52.060> over<00:02:52.120> that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
intended to now I got upset over that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.710 
intended to now I got upset over that
and<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:53.170> made<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> cork<00:02:54.040> gasket<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.760> then<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> have

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
and I made a cork gasket and then I have

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840 
and I made a cork gasket and then I have
a<00:02:55.750> picture<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.830> will<00:02:57.010> show<00:02:57.280> where<00:02:57.610> I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
a picture of that I will show where I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.030 
a picture of that I will show where I
trace<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.750> outline<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> cover<00:02:59.740> and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
trace the outline of the cover and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.490 
trace the outline of the cover and
provided<00:03:00.940> much<00:03:01.180> more<00:03:01.420> surface<00:03:01.750> area<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
provided much more surface area for the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.790 
provided much more surface area for the
court<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.000> nestle<00:03:04.000> against<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> black<00:03:04.720> then<00:03:05.410> I

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
court to nestle against the black then I

this picture shows you you can actually

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.710 
this picture shows you you can actually
collapse<00:03:34.960> that<00:03:35.380> cover<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.280> little<00:03:36.520> bit<00:03:36.720> diplo

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
collapse that cover a little bit diplo

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.420 
collapse that cover a little bit diplo
din<00:03:38.020> well<00:03:38.470> that's<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:38.950> good

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
din well that's not good

din well that's not good
you<00:03:39.520> know<00:03:39.610> that's<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.910> little<00:03:40.120> too<00:03:40.300> much

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
you know that's a little too much

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.450 
you know that's a little too much
strength<00:03:40.810> on<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.230> wrench<00:03:41.410> yet<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.280> don't

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
strength on the wrench yet you you don't

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.580 
strength on the wrench yet you you don't
want<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.670> do<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.060> then<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.050> almost<00:03:44.350> like

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
want to do that then it's almost like

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.330 
want to do that then it's almost like
