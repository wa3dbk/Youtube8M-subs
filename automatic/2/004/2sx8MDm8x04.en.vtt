00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 the vosges region is still a 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.940
 agricultural sector at the base now that 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.949
 diversified with nurseries 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 local market gardening is a day a 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.629
 unusual in the sense that it has to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.190
 to be one of the few in France where 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.049
 we find all the pollution 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.489
 almost and it's true that it gives a 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.260
 dynamic to the territory that is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.559
 inevitably interesting to live when we 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.559
 is a farmer 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.640
 my job is already coming from my 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.030
 parents who are already worshiping hours 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.369
 my dad's parents was 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.020
 same farmer so it's a passion 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.729
 that I share and that today I 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.430
 am happy to be able to share too 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.170
 with customers by selling my product 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.490
 have some feedback on our product this 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.560
 who is of the state for done before 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.570
 so here exploitation is 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.590
 mainly focused on the production of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.540
 apples and pears 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.740
 we produce in cultures 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.430
 conventional and in culture 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.380
 biological 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.060
 the case today we produce some 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.540
 apples and pears with different 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.320
 variety 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.450
 production for products 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.420
 so fresh and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.460
 eq would have conditioned on the site and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.780
 costs the part by related to the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.759
 transformation is made by 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.009
 external providers 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.539
 i am associated with michel mon uncle 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.939
 that is, we work in the 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.299
 gardening tradition 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:59.159
 so after we are a culture 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.369
 traditional manual a lot the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.369
 gardening at the base is cultivating 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.200
 quality vegetables for for the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.330
 final consumption on your plates 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.230
 otherwise we operate around 50 50 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.049
 different references 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.049
 so I settled since 2006 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.160
 with my parents today our 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.700
 profession is a bit peculiar to 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.560
 gabardans in the sense that we have a battle 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.239
 go home like a breed of breeders 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.920
 dairy that my father has been leading there since 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.590
 thirty years he had also 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.900
 installed in gaec with his father and then 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 in 99 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.519
 they had the idea at the time a little 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.010
 crazy to start transforming the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.540
 dairy products on the farm because 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.920
 the farmer is the only profession where we 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.100
 does not make his bill at the end of the month 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.760
 and the only way to reclaim the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.200
 price of the product 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.650
 it was to go after himself 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.600
 to go to the end of the chain in 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.900
 processing on the farm and products 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.170
 dairy 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.150
 and then proposing them to different 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.040
 intermediaries we will say in the countries 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.040
 today the producer shop 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.700
 so we created the homestead 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.879
 we in order to value our 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.360
 production closer to the consumer 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.550
 how to say 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.530
 to be closer to his expectations in 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.420
 made to always be able to give us 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.520
 involved to be able to better the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.440
 satisfy the purpose of the store is 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.290
 to have local products around 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.480
 maximum 80 km around them 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.299
 of the store so when we when we have 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.650
 created the store there is one thing that 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.569
 was imposed on us we wanted 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.140
 cultivate a difference by transforming 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.150
 and by valuing on the spot bah I think 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.510
 especially at our ports to note a meat 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.400
 bovine 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.510
 that's always in order to say to himself he 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.659
 we must value the know-how 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.310
 locally above 200 m² 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.260
 sales area that customers can 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.700
 to frequent daily low behind 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.319
 we have a transformation laboratory 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.569
 meat 200 meters from the rails 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.370
 graphie or there christian note charcutier 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.519
 loïc and guillaume naud butcher 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.829
 transforms the animals of the beaten one 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.379
 is at home and then and our 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.819
 Proveners rillettes pâtés sausages 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.120
 time on the end of a white mill at 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.120
 black pudding 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.370
 10 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.370
 a 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.110
 m 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.100
 the reception of the customers it is good rule 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
 general people they are happy to 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.240
 300 there were no other shops on 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.770
 holy light so the people they are 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.820
 happy and then there he sees all that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.200
 comes they are full on a 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.120
 acceleration to see the producers 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.260
 of a store we must speak 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.720
 in his name of all we can 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.370
 hear on TV on products where 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.169
 we do not know where they come from 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.610
 a price to reassure the customers we 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.510
 ask our unfair way what 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.900
 eat the beasts 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.160
 how old are we stupid race and what is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.960
 they're going to ask us it's still 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.910
 a little more connection with our 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.860
 companies it's still it's the small 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.690
 anecdote of the week it's 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.010
 preparation advice it's things 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.340
 we can not have in a big 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.780
 area 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.610
 and then it's the things we can not 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.960
 have even in a network of stores 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.370
 specialized where they know very well 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.889
 the product is things 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.150
 this relationship is that strong bond and 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.680
 sentimental that we have a vis-à-vis 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.240
 our product is found to be zero 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.919
 apart and that's what it is 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.160
 that we must value today with 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.160
 of our customers
