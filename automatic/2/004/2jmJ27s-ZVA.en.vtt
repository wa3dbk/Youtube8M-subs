it for the whole folder in this case or

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
if you choose restore what it does is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.319 
if you choose restore what it does is
replace<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.650> current<00:02:45.920> one<00:02:46.120> with<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.269> one

replace the current one with that one

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.960 
replace the current one with that one
it's<00:02:47.569> usually<00:02:47.720> safer<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:49.100> maybe<00:02:49.579> replace<00:02:49.850> a
