backward there are three ways to solve
the<00:00:45.630> problem<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> load<00:00:46.830> desperate<00:00:47.670> space<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.300> C

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
the problem of load desperate space in C

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.950 
the problem of load desperate space in C
Drive<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> first<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.000> shrink<00:00:51.300> G<00:00:51.690> Drive

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
Drive the first is to shrink G Drive

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.799 
Drive the first is to shrink G Drive
from<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.830> left<00:00:53.070> side

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:10.859 

and<00:00:59.170> give<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.309> free<00:01:00.610> space<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.270> c-drive

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.319 

and<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.560> second<00:01:11.950> method<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.609> shrink

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
and the second method is to shrink

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:23.669 
and the second method is to shrink
g-drive<00:01:13.990> from<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.649> right<00:01:14.859> side<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:20.649> drag<00:01:22.679> G

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
g-drive from the right side and drag G

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:34.219 
g-drive from the right side and drag G
Drive<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.280> H<00:01:24.520> Drive<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.770> enlarge<00:01:27.369> C<00:01:27.789> Drive<00:01:28.030> so

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.639 

there's<00:01:35.229> more<00:01:35.560> free<00:01:36.130> space<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.670> C<00:01:36.939> Drive<00:01:37.149> and

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
there's more free space in C Drive and

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.550 
there's more free space in C Drive and
last<00:01:38.649> method<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.819> delete<00:01:40.299> G<00:01:40.659> Drive<00:01:40.929> if

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
last method is to delete G Drive if

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.120 
last method is to delete G Drive if
there<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.009> nothing<00:01:42.399> important<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:48.599> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there is nothing important on it and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.339 
there is nothing important on it and
give<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.429> whole<00:01:51.610> space<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.299> G<00:01:52.569> Drive<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:53.110> C

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
give the whole space of G Drive to C

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:59.370 
give the whole space of G Drive to C
Drive

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.980 

after<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:00.560> finish<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.100> urgency<00:02:01.820> drive<00:02:02.030> click

apply

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.610 

now<00:02:35.519> let's<00:02:35.939> check<00:02:36.269> whether<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.900> C<00:02:37.110> Drive<00:02:37.230> has

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
now let's check whether the C Drive has

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.819 
now let's check whether the C Drive has
been<00:02:37.860> enlarged<00:02:42.860> here<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> free<00:02:44.549> space
