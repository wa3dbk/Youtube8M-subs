00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.779
 and friends welcome square world 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.829
 Alex with you again and today I continue 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.259
 construction is not exactly I start 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.960
 building a mechanical house in 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.239
 minecraft and what is this mechanical house 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.939
 Well, firstly, that he 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:34.430
 will contain a very important 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.739
 the function will be basically sorting 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.230
 of things this will be a huge sorter 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.180
 things that will sort things and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.460
 it will actually be very very 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.280
 convenient so well let's do something 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.880
 I will now place the ejector and which 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 will raise all general all resources 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.149
 which I will appear up 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.149
 before 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.080
 as if the most difficult though no 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.700
 difficult task to do so 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.700
 throw out or there was a redstone signal and 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.420
 so now we really have 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.469
 inversion and then we just have to 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.469
 set up so bad 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.080
 great on show blocks alger then somehow 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.140
 absolutely random or 7 for me this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.390
 it was unexpected well now we 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.570
 we start laying our here 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.850
 mechanisms why am I still on such 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.970
 greater height decided to raise all these 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.730
 ejector and well i will tell you so for 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.400
 order to be successful 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.740
 sorting of items is necessary so that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.250
 they were stored somewhere it is logical in 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.780
 principle 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:55.980
 privates treasure chest now you're here veteran 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:58.730
 1000 something full I already like it all 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.420
 in fact but it will still be better 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.420
 diver naturally 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.280
 Well, here guys I taught you how to do 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.920
 what is necessary yes this is only the first part 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.730
 huge resource storage system 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.990
 then everything will be much more interesting and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.930
 even this is my name before the ban 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.120
 sorting house yes as well as what 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.750
 guys with you was alex thanks for all 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.920

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.740
 I will be very pleased
