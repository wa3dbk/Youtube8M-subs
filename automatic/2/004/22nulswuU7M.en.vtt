well<00:01:05.750> on<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.770> internet<00:01:07.130> for<00:01:07.490> years<00:01:07.850> they've

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
well on the internet for years they've

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.120 
well on the internet for years they've
been<00:01:08.570> saying<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.320> if<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.530> have<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.680> really

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
been saying that if you have a really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.810 
been saying that if you have a really
strong<00:01:10.190> magnet<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:12.140> use<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:13.160> wipe<00:01:13.430> off

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
strong magnet you can use it to wipe off

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.770 
strong magnet you can use it to wipe off
the<00:01:14.180> data<00:01:14.619> from<00:01:15.619> your<00:01:15.770> computer's<00:01:16.220> hard<00:01:16.250> drive

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
the data from your computer's hard drive

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.730 
the data from your computer's hard drive
so<00:01:17.780> what<00:01:17.960> you're<00:01:18.140> saying<00:01:18.440> is<00:01:18.770> if<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.880> one

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
so what you're saying is if you have one

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.010 
so what you're saying is if you have one
magnetic<00:01:21.740> field<00:01:22.450> like<00:01:23.450> your<00:01:23.630> computer's<00:01:23.990> hard

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
magnetic field like your computer's hard

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.960 
magnetic field like your computer's hard
drive<00:01:24.380> right<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.490> place<00:01:25.759> another

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
drive right and you place another

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.770 
drive right and you place another
magnetic<00:01:26.930> field<00:01:27.350> next<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:28.369> hard<00:01:28.780> it'll

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
magnetic field next to that hard it'll

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.779 
magnetic field next to that hard it'll
interrupt<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.259> data<00:01:30.500> right<00:01:30.979> but<00:01:31.460> let's<00:01:31.670> not

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
interrupt the data right but let's not

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.330 
interrupt the data right but let's not
do<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.000> yet<00:01:32.420> because<00:01:32.830> what<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:33.890> was<00:01:34.039> thinking

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
do that yet because what I was thinking

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.140 
do that yet because what I was thinking
what<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.610> do<00:01:35.710> was<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:36.920> take<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.130> really<00:01:37.970> big

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
what to do was just take a really big

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.200 
what to do was just take a really big
magnet<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.100> stick<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.250> on<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.580> hard<00:01:40.760> drive

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
magnet and stick it on the hard drive

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.300 
magnet and stick it on the hard drive
and<00:01:41.330> see<00:01:41.450> what<00:01:41.570> happens<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.110> would<00:01:43.040> suggest

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
and see what happens I would suggest

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.710 
and see what happens I would suggest
maybe<00:01:43.700> we<00:01:43.909> take<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.119> little<00:01:44.330> more<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.659> a

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
maybe we take a little more of a

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.960 
maybe we take a little more of a
scientific<00:01:45.200> approach<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:46.310> take<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.520> look<00:01:46.790> at

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
scientific approach we take a look at

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.969 
scientific approach we take a look at
how<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.150> hard<00:01:47.479> drive<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.840> running<00:01:48.200> without<00:01:48.799> a

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
how the hard drive is running without a

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.070 
how the hard drive is running without a
magnet<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.640> then<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.180> take<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.360> look<00:01:50.570> at<00:01:50.750> how<00:01:50.930> it

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
magnet and then we take a look at how it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.469 
magnet and then we take a look at how it
would<00:01:51.229> run<00:01:51.470> with<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> magnet<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:53.060> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
would run with a magnet on it and a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.390 
would run with a magnet on it and a
couple<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.810> variations<00:01:54.080> from<00:01:54.470> there<00:01:54.740> that

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
couple of variations from there that

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.140 
couple of variations from there that
sounds<00:01:55.580> good

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
sounds good

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.660 
sounds good
sounds<00:01:56.990> pretty<00:01:57.140> scientific<00:01:57.439> all<00:01:58.280> right<00:01:58.400> let's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
sounds pretty scientific all right let's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.550 
sounds pretty scientific all right let's
head<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:58.970> workshop<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.570> begin<00:01:59.900> all<00:02:00.350> right

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
let's go okay what we have here is a

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.100 
let's go okay what we have here is a
very<00:02:05.689> strong<00:02:06.320> bar<00:02:06.890> magnet<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:08.600> not<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> kind

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
very strong bar magnet it's not the kind

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.410 
very strong bar magnet it's not the kind
of<00:02:09.170> magnet<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.560> would<00:02:09.649> take<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:09.979> bar<00:02:10.420> it's

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
of magnet you would take to the bar it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.800 
of magnet you would take to the bar it's
the<00:02:11.600> shape<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.140> Mack

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the shape of the Mack

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.390 
the shape of the Mack
and<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.620> show<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:14.830> how<00:02:14.980> strong<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and I'm going to show you how strong it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.360 
and I'm going to show you how strong it
is<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:18.600> now<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.870> can't<00:02:20.110> pull<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.560> directly

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
is out now I can't pull this directly

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.300 
is out now I can't pull this directly
off<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> table<00:02:22.900> no<00:02:23.380> matter<00:02:23.500> how<00:02:23.920> much

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
off for the table no matter how much

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.630 
off for the table no matter how much
might<00:02:24.640> struggle<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.770> actually<00:02:27.160> slide

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
might struggle I have to actually slide

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.350 
might struggle I have to actually slide
it<00:02:27.850> off<00:02:28.470> now<00:02:29.470> that's<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.800> strong<00:02:30.010> magnet<00:02:30.370> all

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it off now that's a strong magnet all

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.860 
it off now that's a strong magnet all
right<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:33.010> thing<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.280> had<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.430> figure<00:02:33.610> out<00:02:33.870> is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
right one thing we had to figure out is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.380 
right one thing we had to figure out is
where<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.709> hard<00:02:35.920> drive<00:02:36.100> on<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.310> laptop<00:02:36.520> okay

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
where is the hard drive on a laptop okay

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.090 
where is the hard drive on a laptop okay
on<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.900> desktop<00:02:38.170> computer<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.680> open<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.950> thing

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
on a desktop computer you open the thing

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.680 
on a desktop computer you open the thing
up<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.550> pretty<00:02:39.790> obvious<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.360> on<00:02:40.600> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
up and it's pretty obvious but on a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.020 
up and it's pretty obvious but on a
laptop<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.290> not<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:42.730> did<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.880> little

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
laptop it's not so we did a little

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.960 
laptop it's not so we did a little
research<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.569> found<00:02:43.750> out<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.200> well<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:45.820> is

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
research we found out that well this is

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.240 
research we found out that well this is
the<00:02:46.060> hard<00:02:46.239> drive<00:02:46.360> right<00:02:46.930> here<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.070> is<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the hard drive right here so this is the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.790 
the hard drive right here so this is the
area<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> computer<00:02:49.560> where<00:02:50.560> we're<00:02:50.680> going

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
area on the computer where we're going

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.040 
area on the computer where we're going
to<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.070> put<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> magnet<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.910> see<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:52.780> we

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
to have to put the magnet to see if we

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.699 
to have to put the magnet to see if we
can<00:02:53.230> get<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.680> result<00:02:54.780> our<00:02:55.780> Mythbusters<00:02:56.260> will<00:02:56.680> be

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
can get a result our Mythbusters will be

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.100 
can get a result our Mythbusters will be
putting<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.310> myth<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.790> test<00:02:57.910> with<00:02:58.569> very

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
putting this myth to the test with very

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.370 
putting this myth to the test with very
scientific<00:03:00.269> experiments<00:03:01.269> first<00:03:02.050> they<00:03:02.260> will

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
scientific experiments first they will

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.250 
scientific experiments first they will
place<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> super-strong<00:03:03.640> magnet<00:03:04.180> directly<00:03:05.140> on

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
place a super-strong magnet directly on

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.830 
place a super-strong magnet directly on
the<00:03:05.350> computer's<00:03:05.769> hard<00:03:06.010> drive<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.640> then<00:03:07.510> turn

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the computer's hard drive and then turn

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.729 
the computer's hard drive and then turn
the<00:03:07.989> computer<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:09.360> next<00:03:10.360> they<00:03:11.319> will<00:03:11.470> place<00:03:11.709> a

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the computer on next they will place a

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.040 
the computer on next they will place a
magnet<00:03:12.250> on<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.430> hard<00:03:12.790> drive<00:03:13.090> while<00:03:13.810> it's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
magnet on the hard drive while it's

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.220 
magnet on the hard drive while it's
running<00:03:15.330> after<00:03:16.330> each<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.840> first<00:03:17.080> two

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
running after each of the first two

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.380 
running after each of the first two
experiments<00:03:18.130> they<00:03:18.549> will<00:03:18.700> check<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.150> hard

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
experiments they will check the hard

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.319 
experiments they will check the hard
drive<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:20.200> see<00:03:20.440> if<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.709> lost<00:03:20.980> any<00:03:21.340> data<00:03:21.459> as<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
drive to see if it lost any data as you

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.130 
drive to see if it lost any data as you
can<00:03:22.690> see<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.820> computer<00:03:25.329> was<00:03:25.480> able<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.750> boot<00:03:25.989> up

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
can see the computer was able to boot up

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.620 
can see the computer was able to boot up
and<00:03:27.329> we've<00:03:28.329> got<00:03:28.570> our<00:03:28.810> typical<00:03:29.579> Microsoft

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
and we've got our typical Microsoft

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.250 
and we've got our typical Microsoft
fixer<00:03:31.630> back<00:03:31.840> here<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.610> magnet<00:03:34.260> didn't

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
fixer back here so the magnet didn't

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.580 
fixer back here so the magnet didn't
wipe<00:03:35.440> out<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.739> hard<00:03:35.920> drive<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:37.239> fact<00:03:37.560> I'd<00:03:38.560> say

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
wipe out the hard drive in fact I'd say

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.830 
wipe out the hard drive in fact I'd say
it<00:03:39.220> didn't<00:03:39.549> do<00:03:39.610> anything<00:03:39.850> at<00:03:40.120> all<00:03:40.299> so<00:03:42.840> to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
it didn't do anything at all so to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.430 
it didn't do anything at all so to
further<00:03:44.049> test<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.799> myth<00:03:46.079> we're<00:03:47.079> gonna<00:03:47.200> put

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
further test this myth we're gonna put

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.229 
further test this myth we're gonna put
the<00:03:47.530> magnet<00:03:47.890> back<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.370> with<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.970> hard<00:03:49.180> drive

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the magnet back on with the hard drive

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.810 
the magnet back on with the hard drive
running<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.380> even<00:03:50.620> move<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> few<00:03:51.130> applications

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
running and even move a few applications

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.849 
running and even move a few applications
around<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.420> see<00:03:52.600> if<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:53.019> eliminate<00:03:53.230> any

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
around to see if we can eliminate any

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.150 
around to see if we can eliminate any
data<00:03:54.640> on<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> hard<00:03:55.239> drive<00:03:55.540> well<00:03:56.109> then<00:03:56.380> restart

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
data on the hard drive well then restart

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.009 
data on the hard drive well then restart
the<00:03:57.250> computer<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.940> see<00:03:58.420> if<00:03:58.480> everything<00:03:58.840> boots

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
the computer and see if everything boots

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.479 
the computer and see if everything boots
up<00:03:59.200> normally<00:03:59.820> sounds<00:04:00.820> like<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.970> plan<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:03.280> ready

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
up normally sounds like a plan you ready

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.349 
up normally sounds like a plan you ready
I'm<00:04:03.970> ready

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
I'm ready

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.470 
I'm ready
are<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.440> sure<00:04:05.650> go<00:04:06.340> ahead<00:04:06.609> this<00:04:07.090> isn't<00:04:07.359> your

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
are you sure go ahead this isn't your

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.630 
are you sure go ahead this isn't your
mother's<00:04:07.720> laptop<00:04:08.109> is<00:04:08.320> it<00:04:08.549> my<00:04:09.549> ping

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
mother's laptop is it my ping

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.610 
mother's laptop is it my ping
sorry<00:04:11.390> mom

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.379 

hmm

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.420 

doesn't<00:04:22.169> seem<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.469> be<00:04:22.620> doing<00:04:22.860> anything<00:04:23.069> at<00:04:23.280> all

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
doesn't seem to be doing anything at all

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.439 
doesn't seem to be doing anything at all
let's<00:04:26.430> take<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.699> look<00:04:26.969> at<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> hard<00:04:27.360> drive

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
let's take a look at the hard drive

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.869 
let's take a look at the hard drive
maybe<00:04:30.830> we<00:04:31.830> put<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.129> magnet<00:04:32.430> on<00:04:32.490> here<00:04:32.699> while<00:04:32.819> it

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
maybe we put the magnet on here while it

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.110 
maybe we put the magnet on here while it
was<00:04:32.999> running<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:34.490> now<00:04:35.490> we<00:04:35.550> can't<00:04:35.849> use<00:04:35.999> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
was running and now we can't use the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.800 
was running and now we can't use the
mouse<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.889> can't<00:04:37.889> run<00:04:38.219> any<00:04:38.370> programs<00:04:38.849> it<00:04:39.389> seems

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
mouse I can't run any programs it seems

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.899

that<00:04:39.990> our<00:04:40.050> magnet<00:04:40.499> has<00:04:40.740> locked<00:04:41.490> up<00:04:41.729> our

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
that our magnet has locked up our

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:48.519 
that our magnet has locked up our
computer<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:44.580> hitting<00:04:44.849> f1<00:04:46.249> this<00:04:47.249> is<00:04:47.400> crazy<00:04:47.789> I

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529 
computer so hitting f1 this is crazy I

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.469 
computer so hitting f1 this is crazy I
think<00:04:49.529> I<00:04:49.770> think<00:04:50.400> we<00:04:50.520> might<00:04:50.699> just<00:04:50.729> have<00:04:51.060> proven

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
think I think we might just have proven

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.189 
think I think we might just have proven
this<00:04:51.629> myth<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:53.000> would<00:04:54.000> have<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.300> say<00:04:54.509> then<00:04:54.779> this

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
this myth I would have to say then this

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.340 
this myth I would have to say then this
myth<00:04:55.439> is<00:04:55.710> definitely<00:04:56.129> plausible

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.550 

now<00:05:01.820> there<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.060> still<00:05:03.390> data<00:05:03.810> on<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.350> hard

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
now there is still data on the hard

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.250 
now there is still data on the hard
drive<00:05:04.830> even<00:05:05.190> though<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:06.030> rendered<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.840> PC

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
drive even though it rendered the PC

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.710 
drive even though it rendered the PC
inoperable<00:05:08.010> if<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.910> send<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.300> hard<00:05:09.570> drive

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
inoperable if you send this hard drive

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.260 
inoperable if you send this hard drive
out<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.350> could<00:05:10.620> be<00:05:10.740> recovered<00:05:11.070> so<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.090> only

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
out it could be recovered so the only

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.770 
out it could be recovered so the only
real<00:05:12.930> way<00:05:13.200> to<00:05:13.230> destroy<00:05:14.070> an<00:05:14.970> entire<00:05:15.180> hard<00:05:15.720> drive

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
real way to destroy an entire hard drive

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.990 
real way to destroy an entire hard drive
to<00:05:16.530> ensure<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:16.890> there's<00:05:17.160> no<00:05:17.280> data<00:05:17.550> left<00:05:17.820> on

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
to ensure that there's no data left on

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:30.460 
to ensure that there's no data left on
it<00:05:20.180> is<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.360> have<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.540> little<00:05:21.810> fun
