00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
wash wide and so in the end you just

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.470 
wash wide and so in the end you just
slow<00:04:04.560> down<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.190> drive<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.579> normally<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.359> then

I<00:04:34.280> find<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.610> little<00:04:35.000> bit<00:04:35.120> annoying<00:04:35.389> about<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
I find a little bit annoying about the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.450 
I find a little bit annoying about the
Juke<00:04:36.050> now<00:04:36.259> you<00:04:36.319> can<00:04:36.680> get<00:04:36.830> in<00:04:36.889> a<00:04:36.949> wheel<00:04:37.159> drive

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
Juke now you can get in a wheel drive

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.159 
Juke now you can get in a wheel drive
version<00:04:37.699> which<00:04:38.120> is<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.330> good<00:04:38.690> thing

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
version which is a good thing

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.559 
version which is a good thing
but<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:40.340> rather<00:04:40.610> expensive<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.479> you

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
but it's rather expensive and you

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.480 
but it's rather expensive and you
remember<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:41.900> boot<00:04:42.530> extension<00:04:43.129> I<00:04:43.190> talked

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
remember that boot extension I talked

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.490 
remember that boot extension I talked
about<00:04:43.639> earlier<00:04:44.090> while<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.050> only<00:04:45.199> applies<00:04:45.470> to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
about earlier while that only applies to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.290 
about earlier while that only applies to
the<00:04:45.650> two<00:04:45.860> wheel<00:04:46.039> drive<00:04:46.340> version<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.879> boot<00:04:47.120> on

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the two wheel drive version the boot on

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.850 
the two wheel drive version the boot on
the<00:04:47.389> four-wheel-drive<00:04:47.720> version<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.440> as

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
the four-wheel-drive version is as

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.499 
the four-wheel-drive version is as
before<00:04:49.099> which<00:04:49.520> means<00:04:49.759> it's<00:04:49.909> quite<00:04:50.180> small

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
before which means it's quite small

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.960 
before which means it's quite small
another<00:04:51.080> thing<00:04:51.319> is<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.620> while<00:04:52.039> I<00:04:52.069> can<00:04:52.340> adjust

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
another thing is that while I can adjust

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.839 
another thing is that while I can adjust
the<00:04:53.150> steering<00:04:53.419> wheel<00:04:53.629> for<00:04:53.840> height<00:04:54.819> so<00:04:55.819> that

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
the steering wheel for height so that

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.920 
the steering wheel for height so that
yep<00:04:56.419> I<00:04:56.740> can't<00:04:57.740> adjust<00:04:58.009> it<00:04:58.250> for<00:04:58.849> reach<00:04:59.120> also

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
yep I can't adjust it for reach also

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.200 
yep I can't adjust it for reach also
when<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:00.289> Juke<00:05:00.470> first<00:05:00.710> came<00:05:00.889> out<00:05:01.039> I<00:05:01.280> kind<00:05:01.940> of

when the Juke first came out I kind of

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.270 
when the Juke first came out I kind of
liked<00:05:02.419> this<00:05:02.720> display<00:05:03.289> system<00:05:03.740> down<00:05:03.919> here<00:05:03.949> the

now<00:05:21.849> going<00:05:22.849> to<00:05:23.000> think<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.629> just<00:05:23.870> a

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
now going to think that this is just a

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.330 
now going to think that this is just a
complete<00:05:24.289> gimmick<00:05:24.650> because<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.979> driving

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
complete gimmick because the driving

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.129 
complete gimmick because the driving
mode<00:05:25.610> settings<00:05:26.030> right<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.750> can<00:05:26.900> look<00:05:27.020> at

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
mode settings right you can look at

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.939 
mode settings right you can look at
information<00:05:27.409> such<00:05:28.069> as<00:05:28.150> g-force<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:30.620> can<00:05:30.770> find

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
information such as g-force you can find

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.969 
information such as g-force you can find
out<00:05:31.069> the<00:05:31.219> engines<00:05:31.669> torque<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:33.289> boost<00:05:33.710> from

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
out the engines torque the boost from

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.149 
out the engines torque the boost from
the<00:05:34.159> turbocharger<00:05:35.229> now<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.740> kind<00:05:36.949> of<00:05:37.009> people

back here also feels a bit dark and

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.879 
back here also feels a bit dark and
dingy<00:06:11.060> because<00:06:11.509> these<00:06:11.659> rear<00:06:11.930> windows<00:06:12.680> are

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
dingy because these rear windows are

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.279 
dingy because these rear windows are
quite<00:06:13.370> small<00:06:13.969> and<00:06:14.210> I<00:06:14.270> think<00:06:14.479> overall<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:14.900> normal

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
quite small and I think overall a normal

quite small and I think overall a normal
super<00:06:15.560> mini<00:06:15.740> like<00:06:16.009> a<00:06:16.219> Volkswagen<00:06:17.029> Polo<00:06:17.210> just

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
super mini like a Volkswagen Polo just

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.309 
super mini like a Volkswagen Polo just
seems<00:06:18.229> a<00:06:18.319> bit<00:06:18.469> more<00:06:18.650> roomy<00:06:19.009> here<00:06:19.159> in<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:19.310> back

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
seems a bit more roomy here in the back

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.760 
seems a bit more roomy here in the back
still<00:06:21.949> the<00:06:22.219> Nissan<00:06:22.490> Juke<00:06:22.759> has<00:06:23.089> a<00:06:23.119> lot<00:06:23.599> more

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
still the Nissan Juke has a lot more

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.529 
still the Nissan Juke has a lot more
personality<00:06:24.770> and<00:06:24.860> as<00:06:24.949> they<00:06:25.069> say<00:06:25.539> personality

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
personality and as they say personality

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.149 
personality and as they say personality
goes<00:06:27.169> a<00:06:27.199> long<00:06:27.469> way<00:06:27.770> but<00:06:27.830> if<00:06:28.069> you're

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
goes a long way but if you're

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.439 
goes a long way but if you're
considering<00:06:28.610> a<00:06:28.639> car<00:06:28.849> like<00:06:28.969> this<00:06:29.119> you<00:06:29.270> should

considering a car like this you should

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.089
