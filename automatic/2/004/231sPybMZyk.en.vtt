00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.040
 love asks guardian angel 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.220
 this saint who covered the whole man 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.420
 his name is different 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.609
 man turns out two intercessors and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.989
 patron for example when we start 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.359
 canon guardian angel 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.789
 This is the angel to anyone they capture 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.890
 swept saint and then you need to read 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.289
 before the icon his keeper nipple icon 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.269
 saint why then name-day 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.630
 He knows more and in the afternoon an angel 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:38.370
 I always thought that the patron saint 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.370
 man's name is his guardian angel 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.490
 mean they can say it 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.800
 we have a question here just in time 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:52.030
 as the terminology whipped we 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.940
 actually lost someone understanding of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.160
 it was even before the revolution was that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.130
 name day that is money as a rule 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.870
 kristin that is because that day 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.470
 they gave a name to the child 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.539
 there is a day for it in general for a day 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.770
 baptism yes that is what this day 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.319
 the saint did not fall into such 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.119
 brewed and gave the name of the person turns 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:18.270
 what is a person's spiritual birthday 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.770
 It turned out three holidays the day of baptism 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.240
 name day that is saint day 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 name and guardian angel day 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.659
 that is, the day an angel of God really 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.819
 an angel is not a man who became an angel 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.729
 in the sky ayuna angel who 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.259
 seems to us from baptism and even 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.749
 the very birth gets kovalets from god 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.609
 grace in baptism guide us and 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:47.279
 instruct on a good deed and therefore 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:51.729
 most likely that all these 3 spiritual 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:55.439
 celebrations they united in one 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.479
 the day that is outside of our holy 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.639
 namesome days that is the same day 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.590
 baptism he is also the day of the guardian angel and 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.749
 then it all began to be called one day 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.789
 now just imagine us ladies 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.770

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.990
 I don't know at all 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.790
 why and when is 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.970
 guardian angel of course are given daily 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.830
 the baptism of man that is he receives from 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.490
 god receiving grace lead us to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.500
 the kingdom of heaven 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.500
 and accordingly we still have a day 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.180
 angel that is exactly our day 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.850
 saint and so raise you manga 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.480

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.010

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650
 day we will certainly remember him as 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.040
 guardian angel well, so maybe we 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.720

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.540
 keeper somehow read well it sure 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.070
 you need to keep in mind the day of baptism because 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.350
 that or let's say the day of the archangel Michael 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.940
