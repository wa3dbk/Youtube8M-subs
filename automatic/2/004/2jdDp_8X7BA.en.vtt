they're<00:00:25.419> like<00:00:25.539> the<00:00:25.659> Silpat<00:00:26.169> so<00:00:26.499> it's<00:00:26.619> a

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
they're like the Silpat so it's a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.370 
they're like the Silpat so it's a
fiberglass<00:00:27.699> mat<00:00:28.269> with<00:00:28.570> silicone<00:00:29.019> on<00:00:29.169> it<00:00:29.289> and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
even though don't worry all right

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.199 
even though don't worry all right
so<00:02:01.159> we're<00:02:01.369> ready<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.610> put<00:02:01.789> this<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.179> oven

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
now 35 minutes at 350 degrees or until a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.059 
now 35 minutes at 350 degrees or until a
toothpick<00:02:07.099> comes<00:02:07.399> out<00:02:07.969> dry<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.739> then<00:02:09.920> it's

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
toothpick comes out dry and then it's

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.330 
toothpick comes out dry and then it's
time<00:02:10.190> for<00:02:10.250> brownies<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> ice<00:02:11.090> cream<00:02:12.340> all

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
right so this is 35 minutes later and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.589 
right so this is 35 minutes later and
I've<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:16.010> stuck<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> toothpick<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.480> it's

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
definitely did the trick even for a

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.710 
definitely did the trick even for a
double<00:02:22.430> batch<00:02:22.579> which<00:02:22.849> I'm<00:02:23.030> very<00:02:23.239> surprised

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
double batch which I'm very surprised

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.740

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
about and I'm not gonna let this cool

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.449 
about and I'm not gonna let this cool
and<00:02:27.049> then<00:02:27.170> we'll<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.440> how<00:02:27.620> easy<00:02:27.859> it<00:02:28.040> pulls<00:02:28.310> out

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
and then we'll see how easy it pulls out

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.110
