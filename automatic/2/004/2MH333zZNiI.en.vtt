00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello love words community today 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 we're a jumping kassels bag and that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 Let's take a look at the belfry of the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.960
 Now with this halloween event again 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.890
 come back natural one is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.200
 a little bit more 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 for those of you who have the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.919
 bell tower have never done and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.419
 do not know how they got there 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.399
 I again in the news a bit 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.520
 summarized how the way there is 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.620
 that's for reward 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.469
 yes one then talked to the npc and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.489
 He has a bell tower 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.650
 one telephones into these 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.060
 output area putted and here 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.040
 one expects together with the others 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.680
 Play until the bar on the top right is full 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.630
 then it starts 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.310
 the heavy duty of this camping is 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.920
 especially that the green fog is possible 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.320
 was always looking up 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.230
 rises and when he touches me he touches you 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.820
 that's why list is faster than you are 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.860
 the first tricky job is coming 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.840
 after a few seconds you have to go in 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.769
 oublish to pieces of debris in the house 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.630
 been blown up 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.729
 I always stand to the left on the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.729
 platform has in his view, 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.180
 After that you can do a bit of a short cut 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.890
 Although on the stairs on the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 second stage already out of print 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.179
 and then comes something already the chest 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.070
 that you can fast enough here to 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.100
 then a short time later two 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.360
 open the doors 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.220
 after that comes in my opinion one 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.899
 the heaviest set to a weird 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.659
 Gear you have to watch that one 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.280
 right on top and then up to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.280
 fight that you do not get stuck in 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.100
 all the gear you have the edge 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.270
 managed to make some narrow places there 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.039
 you have to be careful 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.119
 that really let's bounce the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.979
 camera turns right and now comes the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.869
 funniest imagine if my level 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.490
 stupid there is if you are not at the beginning 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.649
 maintains that down to have to go 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.299
 that you arrived at the bottom you can see the 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.739
 Open the third chest and then it works 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.209
 continue 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.409
 At this point you have the jumping 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.360
 Almost stuff 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.979
 managed and still have to watch that 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 you just do not go to the narrow place 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.000
 falls down and at the end is still in 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.260
 a jump because you are here 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.510
 this staircase can learn to hang 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.310
 you have at the top then a bit short 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 recovers time if you have to do that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.329
 the lightning in the last tom turn 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.379
 beat in the clock and then use 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.879
 but the clock in the tower you have that 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.459
 then done and here you are one 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.829
 Chest these are the first time exotic 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.659
 gloves can and from then every time 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.659
 simply sweet or sour bag
