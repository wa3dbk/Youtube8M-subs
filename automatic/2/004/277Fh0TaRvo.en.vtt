00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.620
 in this lesson I will show you how you can 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.440
 sharpen or sharpen 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.670
 the edges of the images start opening 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
 required image 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.469
 next we make a copy of this 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.029
 images of perry nato it on 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.920
 strikes a new layer and a copy is made 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:25.260
 our image go filter 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.810
 Sharpening and push contour 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 sharpness sets the next value 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.510
 these values â€‹â€‹are set depending on 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.100
 image quality and size for 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 Our image fits the following 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 effect of one hundred ninety two percent 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.160
 radius one and a half and isobel and ninth 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.690
 level as you can see if we press 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 on the image we press the left button 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.710
 the mouse will see what it was before the sharpness and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.199
 what happened after we press ok 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.590
 apply this layer mask click on 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.449
 button add this mask and using 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.270
 paint cans we fill the whole layer 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.670
 black now with a brush 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.680
 and white color has blurred edges 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 opacity set 100 and select 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.820
 only that part of the image that we 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.100
 want i want to highlight flowers girl's face 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.509
 and in some places the hair on this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.060
 let's see what we have 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.570
 it turned out so we increase feel that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.740
 it became after now we add more 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:43.040
 a bit of brightness add a layer mask 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.040
 add curves and bend a bit 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.090
 our curve 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.840
 about here until such a result and 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.509
 go to your mask again fill 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.149
 our layer mask 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.460
 black color we take a little brush 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.160
 we reduce transparency to seventy 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.430
 percent exactly brush insert white 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.400
 color first we set up a taxi and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 paint over our flowers 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.060
 we pass all the girls face and we pass 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.569
 All also on hair several times 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.730
 pressing what happened about here 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:35.099
 such this effect and let's now 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.220
 let's see what happened 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.370
 before and what happened after if we remove everything 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.660
 images more precisely our all manipulations 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.940
 it turns out a girl with such a little 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.569
 vague and face a little missing 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.239
 definition we added clarity to the hair and 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.700
 the girl's face with flowers and added 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.600
 a little bit of light like skin so colored and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.060
 hair is what can be achieved with 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.660
 masks and corrections we need 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.660
 layers
