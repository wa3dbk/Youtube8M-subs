00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
hi dr. D hey guys what's up we found our

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.690 
hi dr. D hey guys what's up we found our
treehouse<00:00:07.470> shape<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.799> morning<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.309> wanted<00:00:08.610> to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
treehouse shape this morning I wanted to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.940 
treehouse shape this morning I wanted to
know<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:08.970> happened<00:00:09.360> yeah<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> felt<00:00:10.559> something

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
know what happened yeah I felt something

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.860 
know what happened yeah I felt something
too<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.880> think<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.420> might<00:00:12.509> have<00:00:12.660> been<00:00:12.690> an

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
too we think that it might have been an

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.799 
too we think that it might have been an
earthquake<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:14.099> can't<00:00:14.309> prove<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.639> yet

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
earthquake but we can't prove it yet

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.810 
earthquake but we can't prove it yet
have<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.020> ever<00:00:16.199> been<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.590> an<00:00:16.740> earthquake<00:00:16.859> yes

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
have you ever been in an earthquake yes

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.269 
have you ever been in an earthquake yes
I<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.230> didn't<00:00:19.529> feel<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.890> same<00:00:19.920> as

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
I have but it didn't feel the same as

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.120 
I have but it didn't feel the same as
what<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.460> felt<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.029> morning<00:00:21.330> see<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.619> told<00:00:22.740> you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
what I felt this morning see I told you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950 
what I felt this morning see I told you
it<00:00:23.220> wasn't<00:00:23.519> an<00:00:23.609> earthquake<00:00:23.699> wait<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> minute

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it wasn't an earthquake wait a minute

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
it wasn't an earthquake wait a minute
all<00:00:25.080> earthquakes<00:00:25.619> don't<00:00:25.890> feel<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> same<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
all earthquakes don't feel the same to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060 
all earthquakes don't feel the same to
begin<00:00:27.449> understanding<00:00:27.630> earthquake<00:00:28.619> shefte

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
begin understanding earthquake shefte

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
begin understanding earthquake shefte
know<00:00:29.220> something<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.179> structure<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
know something about the structure of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
know something about the structure of
the<00:00:30.929> earth<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.949> makes<00:00:32.189> sense<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the earth that makes sense what can you

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.819 
the earth that makes sense what can you
tell<00:00:33.480> us<00:00:33.540> come<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.380> let<00:00:34.559> me<00:00:34.590> show<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:36.649> make<00:00:37.649> up

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
tell us come on let me show you make up

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.990 
tell us come on let me show you make up
this<00:00:38.010> peach<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.489> half

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this peach in half

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.660 
this peach in half
I<00:00:39.800> will<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.260> our<00:00:43.530> earth<00:00:44.010> only

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
I will think this will be our earth only

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
I will think this will be our earth only
it's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.450> smaller<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.590> called<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> scale

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it's a lot smaller it's called a scale

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.430 
it's a lot smaller it's called a scale
model<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> core<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> earth

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
model it is like the core of the earth

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 
model it is like the core of the earth
yours<00:00:49.950> car<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> about<00:00:50.760> half<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> its<00:00:51.390> diameter

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
yours car is about half of its diameter

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
yours car is about half of its diameter
what's<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> made<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> we've<00:00:53.460> never<00:00:53.640> been<00:00:53.969> there

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
what's it made of we've never been there

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.369 
what's it made of we've never been there
but<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.870> made<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.140> iron<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
but we think it's made of iron and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.770 
but we think it's made of iron and
nickel<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.399> inner<00:00:56.610> part<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> core<00:00:57.539> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
nickel the inner part of the core is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
nickel the inner part of the core is
solid<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> outer<00:00:58.890> part<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.460> liquid<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.480> is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
solid and the outer part is liquid it is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.170 
solid and the outer part is liquid it is
so<00:01:00.840> dense<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.770> had<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> gallon<00:01:02.460> jug<00:01:02.850> full

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
so dense if we had a gallon jug full

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
so dense if we had a gallon jug full
your<00:01:03.449> core<00:01:03.809> material<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.530> weigh<00:01:04.559> over<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
your core material would weigh over a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.200 
your core material would weigh over a
hundred<00:01:05.489> pounds

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
hundred pounds

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.200 
hundred pounds
wait<00:01:06.900> dr.<00:01:07.140> D<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.740> asked<00:01:07.920> me<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.090> know

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
wait dr. D you asked me how do we know

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
wait dr. D you asked me how do we know
how<00:01:09.299> big<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> core<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.470> made

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
how big the core is and what it's made

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.160 
how big the core is and what it's made
of<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:11.460> we've<00:01:11.700> never<00:01:11.850> been<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of if we've never been there well it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.070 
of if we've never been there well it's
just<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.680> guess<00:01:13.939> you're<00:01:14.939> kidding<00:01:15.330> well

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
just a guess you're kidding well

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
just a guess you're kidding well
actually<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> pretty<00:01:17.009> good<00:01:17.280> guess<00:01:17.490> based

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
actually it's a pretty good guess based

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
actually it's a pretty good guess based
upon<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> evidence<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
upon a lot of evidence one of the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
upon a lot of evidence one of the
biggest<00:01:19.830> clues<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> structure

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
biggest clues we have to the structure

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
biggest clues we have to the structure
of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> earth<00:01:21.720> comes<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.320> our<00:01:22.439> study<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of the earth comes from our study of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
of the earth comes from our study of
earthquakes<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.659> using<00:01:24.869> earthquakes

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
earthquakes so we're using earthquakes

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.429 
earthquakes so we're using earthquakes
to<00:01:26.159> help<00:01:26.369> us<00:01:26.520> understand<00:01:27.030> earthquakes<00:01:27.689> that's

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to help us understand earthquakes that's

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.830 
to help us understand earthquakes that's
right<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.640> part<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> page<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.630> eat

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
right the part of the page that you eat

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.170 
right the part of the page that you eat
is<00:01:30.990> called<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> Earth's<00:01:31.590> mantle<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.000> as

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
is called the Earth's mantle it's not as

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
is called the Earth's mantle it's not as
dense<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.780> core<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.890> dense

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
dense as the core but it's more dense

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.319 
dense as the core but it's more dense
than<00:01:35.430> what's<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> outside

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
than what's on the outside

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.230 
than what's on the outside
what's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> outside<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.579> called<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> crust

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
what's the outside it's called the crust

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.870 
what's the outside it's called the crust
just<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> crust<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> red<00:01:40.950> very<00:01:41.579> good

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
just like the crust of a red very good

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
just like the crust of a red very good
like<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.750> game<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> piece<00:01:43.409> tears<00:01:43.770> crust<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
like this game a piece tears crust is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
like this game a piece tears crust is
very<00:01:44.430> thin<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.450> crust<00:01:45.720> under<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> oceans<00:01:46.500> is
