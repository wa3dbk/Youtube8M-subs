it<00:04:31.800> would<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.280> go<00:04:32.850> over<00:04:33.210> on<00:04:33.360> protein<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.290> you

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
it would be to go over on protein I you

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.129 
it would be to go over on protein I you
know<00:04:35.160> that's<00:04:35.280> always<00:04:35.639> okay<00:04:36.150> extra<00:04:36.810> protein

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
but it's not causing any harm so i'll

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.879 
but it's not causing any harm so i'll
probably<00:04:44.310> be<00:04:44.660> bombed<00:04:45.660> shooting<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.199> like<00:04:46.290> 210

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
have a feeling by the time i'm done but

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.090 
have a feeling by the time i'm done but
will<00:04:50.580> check<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.880> macro<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:51.479> in<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.600> minute

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
me and i'll go over the macros so first

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.820 
me and i'll go over the macros so first
of<00:04:59.460> all<00:04:59.520> quest<00:05:00.000> style<00:05:00.300> protein<00:05:00.630> bar<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.470> this

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
of all quest style protein bar and this

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.490 
of all quest style protein bar and this
one<00:05:02.010> doesn't<00:05:02.190> have<00:05:02.280> any<00:05:02.550> fancy<00:05:03.030> mix-ins<00:05:03.500> to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
one doesn't have any fancy mix-ins to

make sure between peanut butter and

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.250 
make sure between peanut butter and
banana<00:05:05.970> protein<00:05:06.360> so<00:05:06.750> it's<00:05:06.870> actually<00:05:06.990> really

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
banana protein so it's actually really

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.900 
banana protein so it's actually really
good<00:05:07.350> i<00:05:07.500> had<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.830> flavor<00:05:08.280> combination

what I will take with work to me let me

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.020 
what I will take with work to me let me
have<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:10.979> look<00:06:11.280> at<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.610> macro<00:06:11.970> nutrients<00:06:14.030> all

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
have a look at the macro nutrients all

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.060 
have a look at the macro nutrients all
right<00:06:15.419> that<00:06:15.720> was<00:06:15.750> 92<00:06:16.470> it<00:06:16.620> could<00:06:16.830> have<00:06:16.919> been

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
right that was 92 it could have been

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.700 
right that was 92 it could have been
higher<00:06:17.340> like<00:06:17.699> I<00:06:17.820> said<00:06:18.060> I<00:06:18.090> had<00:06:18.389> a<00:06:18.419> feeling

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
higher like I said I had a feeling

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.540 
higher like I said I had a feeling
protein<00:06:19.710> was<00:06:19.889> going<00:06:20.039> to<00:06:20.099> be<00:06:20.190> more<00:06:20.370> than

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
protein was going to be more than

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.930 
protein was going to be more than
necessary<00:06:20.729> carbs<00:06:21.449> 165<00:06:22.460> 50<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.550> which<00:06:23.699> being

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
necessary carbs 165 50 of which being

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.820 
necessary carbs 165 50 of which being
fiber<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.539> I<00:06:24.599> kept<00:06:24.840> it<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:25.229> know<00:06:25.380> fairly<00:06:25.620> low

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
fiber so I kept it you know fairly low

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.120 
fiber so I kept it you know fairly low
carb<00:06:26.099> alike<00:06:26.400> i<00:06:26.490> was<00:06:26.610> hoping<00:06:26.940> protein<00:06:28.130> 253

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
carb alike i was hoping protein 253

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.330 
carb alike i was hoping protein 253
which<00:06:29.400> is<00:06:29.580> more<00:06:30.030> than

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
which is more than

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.400 
which is more than
Harry<00:06:30.699> but<00:06:30.880> again<00:06:31.180> that's<00:06:31.810> going<00:06:32.139> to<00:06:32.199> be<00:06:32.290> the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
Harry but again that's going to be the

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.960 
Harry but again that's going to be the
one<00:06:32.590> thing<00:06:32.889> that<00:06:32.919> you're<00:06:33.520> still<00:06:33.699> going<00:06:33.820> to<00:06:33.910> be

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
one thing that you're still going to be

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.430 
one thing that you're still going to be
able<00:06:34.000> to<00:06:34.180> be<00:06:34.270> flexible<00:06:34.449> if<00:06:34.870> I<00:06:34.960> want<00:06:35.199> more

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
able to be flexible if I want more

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.909 
able to be flexible if I want more
protein<00:06:35.860> I<00:06:36.160> can<00:06:36.970> sacrifice<00:06:37.120> other

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
protein I can sacrifice other

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.900 
protein I can sacrifice other
macronutrients<00:06:38.919> well<00:06:39.130> in<00:06:39.370> this<00:06:39.460> case<00:06:39.669> it<00:06:39.820> was

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
macronutrients well in this case it was

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.659 
macronutrients well in this case it was
fat<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.630> ya<00:06:40.960> still<00:06:40.990> got<00:06:41.440> 92<00:06:41.830> so<00:06:42.250> it's<00:06:42.370> not<00:06:42.490> like

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
fat and ya still got 92 so it's not like

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.000 
fat and ya still got 92 so it's not like
I'm<00:06:42.820> not<00:06:43.150> hitting<00:06:43.330> a<00:06:43.479> minimum<00:06:43.930> so<00:06:44.440> all<00:06:44.770> in<00:06:44.919> all

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
I'm not hitting a minimum so all in all

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.969 
I'm not hitting a minimum so all in all
did<00:06:45.880> just<00:06:46.210> fine<00:06:46.479> i<00:06:46.510> think<00:06:46.660> this<00:06:46.990> left<00:06:47.290> like<00:06:47.500> 50

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
did just fine i think this left like 50

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.150 
did just fine i think this left like 50
calories<00:06:48.250> which<00:06:49.060> i'm<00:06:49.240> ok<00:06:49.540> with<00:06:49.570> because<00:06:50.199> you

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
calories which i'm ok with because you

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.560 
calories which i'm ok with because you
know<00:06:51.250> there's<00:06:51.430> always<00:06:51.490> still<00:06:51.850> human<00:06:52.210> error<00:06:52.449> i

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
know there's always still human error i

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.870 
know there's always still human error i
think<00:06:52.840> you're<00:06:52.990> just<00:06:53.139> way<00:06:53.800> more<00:06:53.830> likely<00:06:54.160> to<00:06:54.760> be

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
think you're just way more likely to be

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.350 
think you're just way more likely to be
overeating<00:06:55.360> than<00:06:55.750> under<00:06:56.080> eating<00:06:57.150> it's<00:06:58.150> just

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
overeating than under eating it's just

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.300 
overeating than under eating it's just
human<00:06:58.630> nature<00:06:58.660> so<00:06:59.229> we'll<00:06:59.979> see<00:07:00.160> how<00:07:00.190> this

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
human nature so we'll see how this

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.580 
human nature so we'll see how this
recomp<00:07:00.880> goes<00:07:01.090> next<00:07:01.660> week<00:07:02.020> i<00:07:02.199> will<00:07:02.229> show<00:07:02.530> you

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
recomp goes next week i will show you

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.040 
recomp goes next week i will show you
the<00:07:03.040> refeed<00:07:03.790> day<00:07:03.820> it'll<00:07:04.180> probably<00:07:04.389> be<00:07:04.870> the

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
the refeed day it'll probably be the

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.290 
the refeed day it'll probably be the
more<00:07:05.200> interesting<00:07:05.680> day<00:07:05.860> so<00:07:06.790> look<00:07:06.940> forward<00:07:07.180> to
