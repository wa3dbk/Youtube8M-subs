00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
anyway they try to get around sort of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.100 
anyway they try to get around sort of
the<00:00:37.489> delicate<00:00:38.489> subject<00:00:38.850> matter<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.840> one

the delicate subject matter of that one
but<00:00:40.590> here's<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> works<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> pokemon

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
but here's how it works all the pokemon

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.010 
but here's how it works all the pokemon
now<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:44.100> most<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.550> them<00:00:44.700> most<00:00:45.180> pokemon<00:00:45.629> species

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
now or most of them most pokemon species

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.100 
now or most of them most pokemon species
have<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.500> gender<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:47.430> sex<00:00:47.789> three<00:00:48.360> their<00:00:48.510> mail<00:00:48.750> or

have a gender or sex three their mail or

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
have a gender or sex three their mail or
their<00:00:49.260> female<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:50.399> species<00:00:50.700> don't<00:00:51.390> have

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
their female some species don't have

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
their female some species don't have
genders<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.230> Magneton<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
genders like Magneton and some of the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
genders like Magneton and some of the
legendary<00:00:54.510> once<00:00:55.399> but<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.789> doesn't<00:00:57.030> mean

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
legendary once but that doesn't mean

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.779 
legendary once but that doesn't mean
that<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.390> those<00:00:57.600> can't<00:00:57.870> breed<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.789> most

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that all those can't breed the most

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.630 
that all those can't breed the most
pokemon<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.480> breed<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.219> they<00:01:02.219> don't<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
pokemon can breed if they don't have a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.149 
pokemon can breed if they don't have a
gender<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.049> breed<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
gender and they can breed they have to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.380 
up and get any way they learned that so
it's<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.220> good<00:05:58.310> way<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.520> train<00:05:58.850> babies<00:05:59.240> by

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
it's a good way to train babies by

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.630 
it's a good way to train babies by
having<00:05:59.690> powerful<00:06:00.169> moves<00:06:00.410> like<00:06:01.100> if<00:06:01.460> you're

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
having powerful moves like if you're

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.420 
having powerful moves like if you're
training<00:06:02.090> a<00:06:02.270> baby<00:06:02.450> Charmander<00:06:03.200> the<00:06:04.130> fact<00:06:04.370> that

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
training a baby Charmander the fact that

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.940 
training a baby Charmander the fact that
a<00:06:04.520> new<00:06:04.700> flamethrower<00:06:05.419> at<00:06:05.690> level<00:06:06.380> one<00:06:06.590> is<00:06:06.800> going

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
a new flamethrower at level one is going

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.890 
a new flamethrower at level one is going
to<00:06:07.010> mean<00:06:07.190> it's<00:06:07.400> going<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.820> train<00:06:08.120> a<00:06:08.150> lot<00:06:08.390> faster

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
to mean it's going to train a lot faster

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.230 
to mean it's going to train a lot faster
which<00:06:09.350> is<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.530> nice<00:06:09.740> thing<00:06:09.979> to<00:06:10.039> have<00:06:10.280> so<00:06:11.000> you've

certain hard to get attacks there's a

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.210 
certain hard to get attacks there's a
huge<00:06:32.930> list<00:06:33.140> of<00:06:33.229> examples<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.830> I'm<00:06:33.950> not<00:06:34.070> going

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
huge list of examples that I'm not going

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.570 
huge list of examples that I'm not going
to<00:06:34.280> go<00:06:34.370> into<00:06:34.550> but<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.120> best

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
to go into but the best

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.490 
to go into but the best
tax<00:06:35.759> in<00:06:35.939> the<00:06:36.030> game<00:06:36.210> for<00:06:36.539> certain<00:06:36.810> pokemon<00:06:36.990> can

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
tax in the game for certain pokemon can

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.040 
tax in the game for certain pokemon can
only<00:06:37.710> be<00:06:37.889> bred<00:06:38.280> into<00:06:38.550> them<00:06:38.879> or<00:06:39.479> using<00:06:39.960> a

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
only be bred into them or using a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.619 
only be bred into them or using a
technical<00:06:40.439> machine<00:06:40.560> or<00:06:40.919> something<00:06:41.039> like<00:06:41.280> that

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629 
technical machine or something like that

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.559 
technical machine or something like that
so<00:06:42.629> that's<00:06:42.810> basically<00:06:43.050> it<00:06:43.439> for<00:06:43.590> breeding<00:06:44.159> I

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
so that's basically it for breeding I

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.100 
so that's basically it for breeding I
believe<00:06:45.569> if<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:47.060> mother<00:06:48.060> i<00:06:48.389> think<00:06:48.719> is<00:06:48.840> holding

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
believe if the mother i think is holding

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.140 
believe if the mother i think is holding
an<00:06:49.199> everstone<00:06:49.500> you<00:06:49.919> can<00:06:50.069> kind<00:06:50.310> of<00:06:50.400> transfer

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150

will talk about in generation 3 when

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.610 
will talk about in generation 3 when
that's<00:06:57.060> introduced<00:06:57.569> but<00:06:57.840> that's<00:06:58.439> basically
