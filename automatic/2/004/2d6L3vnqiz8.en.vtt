what<00:02:30.650> they<00:02:30.680> needed<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.450> there<00:02:32.660> were

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
what they needed and so there were

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.520 
what they needed and so there were
ripples<00:02:33.550> iridescent<00:02:34.550> coatings<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:36.200> they

ripples iridescent coatings that they

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.260 
ripples iridescent coatings that they
couldn't<00:02:36.830> get<00:02:36.980> from<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> manufacturers<00:02:38.120> at

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
couldn't get from the manufacturers at

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.810 
couldn't get from the manufacturers at
that<00:02:38.420> time<00:02:38.720> one<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.770> them<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:40.130> example<00:02:40.160> was

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
that time one of them for example was

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.270 
that time one of them for example was
the<00:02:41.000> granite<00:02:41.420> surface<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.530> created<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.070> by

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the granite surface and I created it by

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280 
the granite surface and I created it by
dragging<00:02:43.700> an<00:02:44.030> old<00:02:44.239> steel<00:02:44.540> pipe<00:02:44.840> out<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.110> the

Willamette River Bank and fashioned a
