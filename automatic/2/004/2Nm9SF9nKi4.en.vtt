goal<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.760> think<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> these<00:00:42.750> players

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
goal I think that all of these players

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.829 
goal I think that all of these players
are<00:00:43.199> going<00:00:43.409> to<00:00:43.470> have<00:00:43.620> some<00:00:43.890> tired<00:00:44.190> legs

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
are going to have some tired legs

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.969 
are going to have some tired legs
potentially<00:00:45.839> to<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> decision<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> pick<00:00:46.829> him

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
potentially to the decision to pick him

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.860 
potentially to the decision to pick him
as<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.250> first<00:00:47.519> kicker<00:00:47.909> the<00:00:48.449> fact<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.720> he

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
as your first kicker the fact that he

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.240 
as your first kicker the fact that he
was<00:00:48.960> cramping<00:00:49.470> at<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> end<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.949> game<00:00:49.979> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
was cramping at the end of the game the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
was cramping at the end of the game the
fact<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.550> he<00:00:50.729> hadn't<00:00:51.089> trained<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:52.019> two<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
fact that he hadn't trained for two and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
fact that he hadn't trained for two and
a<00:00:52.320> half<00:00:52.470> weeks<00:00:52.500> after<00:00:53.159> a<00:00:53.190> cartilage<00:00:53.729> injury<00:00:54.089> to

a half weeks after a cartilage injury to
his<00:00:54.329> knee<00:00:54.570> makes<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.680> wonder<00:00:55.920> whether<00:00:56.250> he<00:00:56.550> was

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
his knee makes you wonder whether he was

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.399 
his knee makes you wonder whether he was
the<00:00:56.909> fitting<00:00:57.210> choice<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.720> be<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.869> first<00:00:58.170> kick

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
of Ritalin yeah I have to agree I think

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.240 
of Ritalin yeah I have to agree I think
they<00:01:00.900> just<00:01:00.930> felt<00:01:01.350> his<00:01:01.530> leadership<00:01:01.860> and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
shooters are clearly going to a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.590 
shooters are clearly going to a
particular<00:02:40.200> point<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.980> goal

particular point in the goal

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.720 
particular point in the goal
trying<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> deceive<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.530> goalkeeper<00:02:43.160> the

trying to deceive the goalkeeper the

goalkeeper their two philosophies Roger

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.350 
goalkeeper their two philosophies Roger
one<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.040> just<00:02:46.220> outright<00:02:46.550> guests<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.150> make

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
one is you just outright guests and make

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.630 
one is you just outright guests and make
sure<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.720> get<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.260> particular<00:02:48.470> side<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
sure you get to that particular side the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.850 
sure you get to that particular side the
second<00:02:50.060> one<00:02:50.210> is<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.020> try<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.470> pick<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.770> a

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
second one is that you try and pick up a

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.350 
second one is that you try and pick up a
signal<00:02:52.070> from<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.460> kicker<00:02:52.640> before<00:02:53.030> he<00:02:53.090> shoots

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
signal from the kicker before he shoots

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.120 
signal from the kicker before he shoots
the<00:02:53.660> last<00:02:54.080> one<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> direction<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.950> you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
the last one is the direction that you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:05.059 
the last one is the direction that you
go<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.570> Romario<00:02:57.430> yeah<00:02:58.810> gross<00:02:59.810> there

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.809 

as<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.540> fans<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.109> Brazil<00:03:08.069> celebrating

as we see the fans in Brazil celebrating
the<00:03:08.909> goal<00:03:09.120> he<00:03:09.689> walks<00:03:09.930> away<00:03:10.109> like<00:03:10.439> not<00:03:11.010> a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
the goal he walks away like not a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.849 
the goal he walks away like not a
problem<00:03:11.549> well<00:03:12.269> I'm<00:03:12.780> Romario<00:03:13.290> has<00:03:13.499> scored

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
problem well I'm Romario has scored

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.690 
problem well I'm Romario has scored
first<00:03:14.159> once<00:03:14.489> again<00:03:14.819> for<00:03:15.090> Brazil<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:16.579> think<00:03:17.579> this

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
first once again for Brazil I think this

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.220 
first once again for Brazil I think this

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
one hits the inside of the post let's

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.580 

talking<00:03:23.650> about<00:03:23.799> cutting<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.249> pretty<00:03:24.280> now

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
talking about cutting it pretty now

alber<00:03:26.590> Giovanni<00:03:27.450> will<00:03:28.450> come<00:03:28.659> up<00:03:28.810> next<00:03:29.549> italy

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
alber Giovanni will come up next italy

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.880 
alber Giovanni will come up next italy
and<00:03:31.989> that's<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.230> little<00:03:32.349> bit<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.739> surprise

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
and that's a little bit of a surprise

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.430 
and that's a little bit of a surprise
because<00:03:33.160> he<00:03:33.610> came<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:33.970> as<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.209> substitute

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
because he came on as a substitute

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.550 
because he came on as a substitute
maybe<00:03:35.860> logic<00:03:36.700> here<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.090> he<00:03:37.690> at<00:03:37.810> least<00:03:37.960> has<00:03:38.230> a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
maybe logic here is he at least has a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.620 
maybe logic here is he at least has a
more<00:03:39.280> likelihood<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:39.730> having<00:03:39.820> fresh<00:03:40.210> lace<00:03:40.480> to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
more likelihood of having fresh lace to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.210 
more likelihood of having fresh lace to

right<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:47.850> target<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.980> curse<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.460> 17

possibly has gone away for the Italians

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.470 
possibly has gone away for the Italians
and<00:03:55.070> Roger<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.430> don't<00:03:55.700> think<00:03:55.880> there<00:03:56.030> was<00:03:56.150> any

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
and Roger I don't think there was any

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.870 
and Roger I don't think there was any
guessing<00:03:57.080> or<00:03:57.230> any<00:03:57.440> antics<00:03:57.950> going<00:03:58.250> on<00:03:58.430> there<00:03:58.670> he

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
guessing or any antics going on there he

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.530 
guessing or any antics going on there he
just<00:03:59.150> blasted<00:03:59.900> up<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.650> middle<00:04:00.800> of<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.130> goal

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
just blasted up the middle of the goal

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.880 
just blasted up the middle of the goal
hit<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.780> ton<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:03.290> just<00:04:03.440> hope<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.650> the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
hit it a ton and just hope that the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.270 
hit it a ton and just hope that the
goalkeeper<00:04:04.400> can't<00:04:04.640> get<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> touch<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:06.280> well

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
goalkeeper can't get a touch on it well

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.160 
goalkeeper can't get a touch on it well
that's<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.820> course<00:04:08.030> another<00:04:08.540> theory<00:04:08.900> of

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
that's of course another theory of

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.470 
that's of course another theory of
penalty<00:04:09.560> shooting<00:04:10.460> is<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:10.970> keeper<00:04:11.270> is

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
penalty shooting is that the keeper is

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.900 
penalty shooting is that the keeper is
going<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.960> move<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.980> why<00:04:13.250> worry<00:04:13.580> about<00:04:13.670> a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
going to move so why worry about a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.910 
going to move so why worry about a
corner<00:04:14.330> just<00:04:14.510> hit<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.960> where<00:04:15.230> he<00:04:15.260> used<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.740> be

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
corner just hit it where he used to be

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.920 
corner just hit it where he used to be
you<00:04:16.730> know<00:04:16.820> what<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.000> think<00:04:17.329> she<00:04:17.480> missed<00:04:17.720> if<00:04:17.810> you

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
you know what I think she missed if you

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.270 
you know what I think she missed if you
can<00:04:18.079> hit<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.260> where<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.560> goalkeeper<00:04:18.980> used<00:04:19.160> to

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
can hit it where the goalkeeper used to

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.860 
can hit it where the goalkeeper used to
be<00:04:19.400> why<00:04:19.640> not<00:04:19.820> hit<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.060> low<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:20.510> corner

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
be why not hit it low and in the corner

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.120 
be why not hit it low and in the corner
the<00:04:20.989> keepers<00:04:21.290> not<00:04:21.440> gonna<00:04:21.650> get<00:04:21.799> there<00:04:22.010> yeah

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130
