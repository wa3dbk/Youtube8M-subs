in<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:07.080> previous<00:00:07.529> lesson<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:07.980> looked<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
in the previous lesson we looked to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.380 
in the previous lesson we looked to
actually<00:00:08.850> installing<00:00:09.420> Active<00:00:09.809> Directory

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.390 
actually installing Active Directory

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.820 
actually installing Active Directory
services<00:00:11.390> in<00:00:11.690> this<00:00:12.080> lesson<00:00:12.440> we're<00:00:12.530> gonna<00:00:12.590> look

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
services in this lesson we're gonna look

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.010 
services in this lesson we're gonna look
at<00:00:12.980> actually<00:00:13.250> configuring<00:00:13.880> an<00:00:14.150> enterprise

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
at actually configuring an enterprise

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.410 
at actually configuring an enterprise
certificate<00:00:15.560> authority<00:00:16.070> now<00:00:16.760> remember<00:00:17.240> if

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
certificate authority now remember if

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.510 
certificate authority now remember if
this<00:00:17.690> is<00:00:17.840> your<00:00:18.010> organization<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:19.160> you're

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
this is your organization and you're

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.670 
this is your organization and you're
setting<00:00:19.790> this<00:00:20.000> up<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:20.720> probably<00:00:20.930> do<00:00:21.260> want<00:00:21.500> a

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
setting this up you probably do want a

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.040 
setting this up you probably do want a
root<00:00:22.040> CA<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.940> if<00:00:23.180> you're<00:00:23.360> medium<00:00:23.840> to

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
root CA and if you're medium to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.170 
root CA and if you're medium to
large-sized<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:24.950> probably<00:00:25.340> want<00:00:25.580> this<00:00:25.790> to<00:00:26.029> be

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
large-sized you probably want this to be

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.150 
large-sized you probably want this to be
offline<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:27.470> would<00:00:27.590> want<00:00:27.770> to<00:00:27.830> install

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
offline so you would want to install

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.990 
offline so you would want to install
this<00:00:28.340> on<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.669> non<00:00:29.270> domain<00:00:29.779> joint<00:00:30.169> machine<00:00:31.000> you

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
this on a non domain joint machine you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.230 
this on a non domain joint machine you
would<00:00:32.119> create<00:00:32.480> that<00:00:32.660> root<00:00:33.170> CA<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:34.700> would<00:00:34.880> then

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
would create that root CA you would then

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.080 
would create that root CA you would then
have<00:00:35.750> it<00:00:35.930> online<00:00:36.110> for<00:00:36.650> a<00:00:36.680> brief<00:00:36.980> period<00:00:37.090> while

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
have it online for a brief period while

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.370 
have it online for a brief period while
you<00:00:38.210> went<00:00:38.390> ahead<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.810> created<00:00:39.020> some

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
you went ahead and created some

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.890 
you went ahead and created some
subordinate<00:00:40.010> CAS<00:00:40.430> which<00:00:41.180> would<00:00:41.420> have<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:41.690> to

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
subordinate CAS which would have this to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.230 
subordinate CAS which would have this to
get<00:00:42.079> signed<00:00:42.440> by<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.860> root<00:00:43.100> CA<00:00:43.400> you<00:00:44.180> would

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
get signed by that root CA you would

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.480 
get signed by that root CA you would
export<00:00:44.720> out<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.140> root<00:00:45.350> CA<00:00:45.620> certificate<00:00:46.280> keep

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
export out that root CA certificate keep

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.770 
export out that root CA certificate keep
it<00:00:46.610> somewhere<00:00:46.820> very<00:00:46.880> very<00:00:47.210> safe<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:47.690> secure

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
it somewhere very very safe and secure

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.740 
it somewhere very very safe and secure
and<00:00:48.530> then<00:00:49.400> turn<00:00:49.700> that<00:00:49.850> machine<00:00:50.000> effectively

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
and then turn that machine effectively

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.200 
and then turn that machine effectively
off<00:00:50.930> once<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.470> have<00:00:51.650> those<00:00:51.830> subordinate<00:00:52.520> CAS

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
off once you have those subordinate CAS

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.090 
off once you have those subordinate CAS
but<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:53.810> this<00:00:53.930> example<00:00:54.110> I'm<00:00:54.590> just<00:00:54.620> going<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.980> go

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
but in this example I'm just going to go

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.880 
but in this example I'm just going to go
ahead<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.670> create<00:00:55.970> an<00:00:56.240> enterprise<00:00:56.660> CA<00:00:57.170> within

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
ahead and create an enterprise CA within

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.610 
ahead and create an enterprise CA within
my<00:00:58.010> Active<00:00:58.310> Directory<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:59.170> this<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.290> gonna<00:01:00.470> be

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
my Active Directory and this is gonna be

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.860 
my Active Directory and this is gonna be
the<00:01:00.770> root<00:01:00.950> CA<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.970> what<00:01:02.210> do<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:02.360> installed<00:01:02.750> it

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
the root CA so what do you installed it

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.229 
the root CA so what do you installed it
now<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:03.710> telling<00:01:03.920> me<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:04.400> need<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.970> go<00:01:05.119> ahead

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
now it's telling me I need to go ahead

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.420 
now it's telling me I need to go ahead
and<00:01:05.570> actually<00:01:05.869> configure<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:06.530> now<00:01:07.009> before<00:01:07.189> I

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
and actually configure it now before I

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.640 
and actually configure it now before I
did<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.790> configuration<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> file

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
did this configuration there is a file

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.399 
did this configuration there is a file
called<00:01:09.830> CA<00:01:10.759> Policy<00:01:11.420> door<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.780> if<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.080> doesn't

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
called CA Policy door in if that doesn't

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.499 
called CA Policy door in if that doesn't
exist<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:13.250> completely<00:01:13.670> optional<00:01:13.970> but

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
exist and it's completely optional but

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.599 
exist and it's completely optional but
you<00:01:14.719> can<00:01:14.960> go<00:01:15.109> ahead<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.590> create<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.100> file

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
you can go ahead and create this file

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.669 
you can go ahead and create this file
and<00:01:16.999> it<00:01:17.359> will<00:01:17.479> actually<00:01:17.570> populate<00:01:18.289> a<00:01:18.320> lot<00:01:18.590> of

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
and it will actually populate a lot of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.859 
and it will actually populate a lot of
the<00:01:18.770> information<00:01:19.070> needed<00:01:19.789> during<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.509> wizard

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
the information needed during the wizard

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.840 
the information needed during the wizard
it<00:01:21.259> additionally<00:01:22.070> lets<00:01:22.429> you<00:01:22.609> configure

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
it additionally lets you configure

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.239 
it additionally lets you configure
settings<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:23.899> can't<00:01:24.289> configure<00:01:24.740> using

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
settings that you can't configure using

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.190 
settings that you can't configure using
the<00:01:25.340> graphical<00:01:25.670> interface<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:26.719> is<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.899> great

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
the graphical interface this is a great

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.139 
the graphical interface this is a great
article<00:01:27.679> that<00:01:28.280> she<00:01:28.490> goes<00:01:28.670> through<00:01:28.909> and

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
article that she goes through and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.719 
article that she goes through and
describes<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.140> syntax<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.069> file<00:01:31.429> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
describes the syntax of this file and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.389 
describes the syntax of this file and
some<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.240> most<00:01:32.390> useful<00:01:32.659> settings<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.280> go

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
some of the most useful settings so go

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.219 
some of the most useful settings so go
ahead<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:34.759> take<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> look<00:01:35.240> at<00:01:35.359> this<00:01:35.450> one<00:01:35.990> thing

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
ahead and take a look at this one thing

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.770 
ahead and take a look at this one thing
that's<00:01:36.499> interesting<00:01:36.740> notice<00:01:37.729> on<00:01:37.939> a<00:01:37.999> root<00:01:38.359> CA

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
that's interesting notice on a root CA

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.499 
that's interesting notice on a root CA
for<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.439> like<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.590> corporation<00:01:40.130> its<00:01:40.909> certificate

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
for a like a corporation its certificate

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.690 
for a like a corporation its certificate
is<00:01:41.630> valid<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.170> 20<00:01:42.740> years<00:01:43.069> this<00:01:43.310> isn't<00:01:43.579> saying

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
is valid for 20 years this isn't saying

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.340 
is valid for 20 years this isn't saying
you<00:01:43.819> want<00:01:43.969> to<00:01:44.060> keep<00:01:44.240> having<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.689> renew<00:01:45.020> that's

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
you want to keep having to renew that's

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.050 
you want to keep having to renew that's
a<00:01:45.409> lot<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.619> work<00:01:45.799> involved<00:01:46.249> so<00:01:46.909> it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
a lot of work involved so it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.239 
a lot of work involved so it
certificates<00:01:47.450> may<00:01:47.810> be<00:01:47.869> valid<00:01:48.079> for<00:01:48.319> 20<00:01:48.710> years

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
certificates may be valid for 20 years

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.309 
certificates may be valid for 20 years
there's<00:01:49.549> also<00:01:49.789> examples<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.479> other<00:01:50.600> files<00:01:51.079> we

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
there's also examples of other files we

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.649

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
gonna use for this certificate and then

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.400 
gonna use for this certificate and then
I<00:02:11.000> want<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.300> configure<00:02:11.569> my<00:02:11.840> certificate

an enterprise CA now I have this option

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.800 
an enterprise CA now I have this option
because<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.409> is<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> member<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.580> domain<00:02:19.939> if

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
create these as subordinates I would say

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.630 
create these as subordinates I would say
this<00:02:44.269> is<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> subordinate<00:02:45.110> CA<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.769> notice<00:02:46.519> it

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
this is a subordinate CA and notice it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.360 
this is a subordinate CA and notice it
enables<00:02:47.090> his<00:02:47.239> certificate<00:02:47.900> request<00:02:48.319> which<00:02:49.099> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
enables his certificate request which I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.580 
enables his certificate request which I
could<00:02:49.610> then<00:02:49.640> export<00:02:50.299> out<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.569> a<00:02:50.630> file<00:02:50.900> over

could then export out to a file over

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.559 
could then export out to a file over

then load that into my standalone root

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.780 
then load that into my standalone root
CA<00:02:53.900> which<00:02:54.590> would<00:02:54.769> then<00:02:54.920> take<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.489> request

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
CA which would then take the request

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.580 
CA which would then take the request
generate<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.360> certificate<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.170> then<00:02:57.380> bring

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
generate the certificate and then bring

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.440 
generate the certificate and then bring

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
cryptography what's the name so the name

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.360 
cryptography what's the name so the name
for<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.319> basically<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.040> name<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.280> the

I now have an enterprise CA if I go to
my<00:03:29.840> tools<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:30.889> difficult<00:03:31.549> for<00:03:31.730> T<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.269> can<00:03:33.019> now

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
my tools it's difficult for T I can now

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.770 
my tools it's difficult for T I can now
see<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.380> have<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.889> CA<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.389> can<00:03:35.540> start

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
see I have that CA and I can start

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.699 
see I have that CA and I can start
looking<00:03:35.930> at<00:03:36.260> all<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.560> different

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
looking at all the different

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.470 
looking at all the different
certificates<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.579> can<00:03:37.700> give<00:03:37.880> stiff<00:03:38.090> cuts<00:03:38.269> out<00:03:38.450> I

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
certificates I can give stiff cuts out I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.509 
certificates I can give stiff cuts out I
can<00:03:38.750> see<00:03:38.870> my<00:03:39.019> templates<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.950> could<00:03:40.280> go<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
can see my templates I could go and

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.099 
can see my templates I could go and
manage<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.239> we're<00:03:41.389> gonna<00:03:41.480> talk<00:03:41.720> about<00:03:41.870> all

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
manage and we're gonna talk about all

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.860 
manage and we're gonna talk about all
these<00:03:42.260> things<00:03:42.500> in<00:03:42.799> more<00:03:43.100> detail<00:03:43.579> now<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.660> was

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
these things in more detail now if I was

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.720 
these things in more detail now if I was
to<00:03:45.109> actually<00:03:45.230> go<00:03:45.590> ahead<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.100> look<00:03:46.370> at<00:03:46.609> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
to actually go ahead and look at the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.330 
to actually go ahead and look at the
certificates<00:03:47.299> of<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.600> machine<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:49.220> I'd

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
certificates of this machine so I'd

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.710 
certificates of this machine so I'd
remove<00:03:49.639> snap<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.150> we're<00:03:50.420> gonna<00:03:50.480> add

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
remove snap in we're gonna add

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
remove snap in we're gonna add
certificates<00:03:51.319> my<00:03:52.280> computer<00:03:52.790> account

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.280 

you'll<00:03:56.490> see<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:57.120> its<00:03:57.420> new<00:03:57.690> certificate

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
you'll see I have its new certificate

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.710 
you'll see I have its new certificate
and<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.310> all<00:03:59.520> issuance<00:04:00.060> policies<00:04:00.570> or

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and this is for all issuance policies or

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.200 
and this is for all issuance policies or
application<00:04:01.410> policies<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.520> was<00:04:02.700> issued<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
application policies it was issued to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.140 
application policies it was issued to
and<00:04:03.840> issued<00:04:04.410> by<00:04:04.620> itself<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:05.880> signed

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
and issued by itself so it's signed

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.540 
and issued by itself so it's signed
itself<00:04:06.630> my<00:04:06.780> certification<00:04:07.470> path<00:04:07.710> just<00:04:08.250> shows

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
itself my certification path just shows

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.730 
itself my certification path just shows
me<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.110> certificate<00:04:10.350> I'm

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
me so this is that certificate I'm

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.710 
me so this is that certificate I'm
signing<00:04:10.980> for<00:04:11.280> myself<00:04:11.640> that's<00:04:11.910> valid<00:04:12.270> for<00:04:12.450> five

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
signing for myself that's valid for five

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.680 
signing for myself that's valid for five
years<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:14.070> was<00:04:14.280> generated<00:04:14.910> when<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> ran<00:04:15.510> that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
years this was generated when I ran that

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.930 
years this was generated when I ran that
wizard<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.370> now<00:04:17.640> have<00:04:17.910> a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
wizard so it's it I now have a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.850 
wizard so it's it I now have a
certificate<00:04:18.180> authority<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:19.200> what<00:04:19.530> I'm<00:04:19.650> now
