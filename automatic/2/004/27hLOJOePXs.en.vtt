00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
here so I'm not training alone but we

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.330 
here so I'm not training alone but we
are<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:22.970> small<00:01:23.390> group<00:01:23.420> but<00:01:23.860> yeah<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.159> to

are a small group but yeah I like to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.149 
are a small group but yeah I like to
train<00:01:25.549> alone<00:01:25.759> because<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.710> get<00:01:27.710> over<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
train alone because you get over the

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.430 
train alone because you get over the
limits<00:01:28.790> by<00:01:28.970> yourself<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.690> train<00:01:29.930> alone<00:01:30.170> and

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
limits by yourself to train alone and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.130 
limits by yourself to train alone and
you<00:01:30.560> do<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.040> power<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.030> interval<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.690> you

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
you do the power and interval so you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.810 
you do the power and interval so you
feel<00:01:33.350> your<00:01:33.500> body<00:01:33.710> harder<00:01:34.399> when<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:34.610> train

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
feel your body harder when you train

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.770 
feel your body harder when you train
alone

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
