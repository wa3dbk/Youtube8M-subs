\f0\fs24 \cf0 This stuff looks and smells
like saving money. They say an eco-friendly

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.470
house can't be built in 150 days for $150,000,
and I say it can. I'm Allen Smith, join me

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.840
as I push the limits with time, budget and
creativity with the Garden Home Challenge,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.480
exclusively on eHow Home. It's just amazing
how this house feels with the insulation almost

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.940
completely done. We got a little bit of an
area up here that I just want to show you.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.230
Because, you know, energy efficiency is so
important, and here you can get a real sense

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.379
of just how thick this insulation is. It's
really quite extraordinary. They spray this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.879
on and it foams out and builds out, and they'll
cut this off because here we're going to have

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.359
a finish board that'll come across the ceiling
and then back down. So that's why this is

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.019
cut. So, the point is we're trying to get
as much of an R-Value as we possibly can with

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.399
all the insulation, and the envelope that
surrounds this entire house. We've also done

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.820
this with our windows and our doors. We've
made sure they're all Energy Star rated so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.971
we can get that maximum energy efficiency
from these. Because here's the deal, if you

00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:19.360
take and you look at your expenses, the cost
of utilities in a year, if you break it down,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.610
just a few interesting things: ten percent
of your utilities your spending on lighting,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.740
the energy to power lights. Fifty percent
goes to heating and cooling. So it was really

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.790
important to me that we focus on areas that
impact that number. So, we've done everything

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.800
we can with insulation, windows and doors.
And when it comes to the heating and cooling

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.890
system, we're doing these mini-splits. And
that allows us to really cut the cost of our

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.550
energy consumption by up to twenty-five percent.
So let's say the average cost for your utilities

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.280
is $4,200, per year. What this system can
do is save up to $1,000 a year in the cost

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.660
of utilities, which over ten years is 10,000
bucks. So in ten years you virtually have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.751
the system paid for. The reason this system
is so efficient with energy is that you're

00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:13.950
really only heating and cooling the spaces
you're living in. Why would you want heat

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.061
and cool this whole upstairs if, you know,
you were just mainly living downstairs. So

00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:24.750
by having it zoned very comfortably, you're
saving money. Actually, you're making money

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.480
while you sleep. Hey, if you're enjoying these
updates on the house, check-in regularly and
