 that she attended at home was so 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.809
 He went to his Augustinian house where 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.180
 ended up anesthetizing her and injecting her 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.120

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.699
 treatment was 800 soles she only 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.030
 gave her 500 soles, the rest she would give 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.580
 then take the class to go 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.890

 relax calmly and I am very sleepy 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.840
 I tell him I'm dizzy and nauseated 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.520
 I've already done you kicked out and you feel something not 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.110
 I do not feel anything about that then I do not 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.180
 I was already applying that product 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.610
 hours later stephanie alcÃ¡ntar 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 He began to feel ill ached 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
 buttocks head and had dizziness 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.880
 remember that I end up fainting and it was 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.800
 led by his family to the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.080
 hipolito unanue hospital where 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.060
 remained interned for three days 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.850
 there they told him that he had been injected 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.729
 a very harmful substance that could 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.690
 have caused death after leaving 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.370
 of the hospital 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.290
 Stephania received the call from the 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.660
 cosmiatra who called her to charge her 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.090
 the remaining money was so the young 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.040
 She coordinated a meeting at his home and told 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.650
 the police who detained her with 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.290
 all the implements that the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.780
 content of these injections is the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.429
 famous airplane oil 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 and three of each 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:18.740
 one of them go every thigh but in 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.210
 reality is to play with death for 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.700
 stephanie hopes to get help for 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.800
 have an adequate treatment does more 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.930
 7 months suffered the loss of his mother 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.580
 murdered by whom it was said was his 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.230
 couple and whose body was found 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.230
 buried in a piece of land in jicamarca 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.260
 after that he tried to forget the penalties 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.900
 singing and dancing on a stage 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.290
 but now he just hopes to be able to recover 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.599
 your health 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.400
 very well and to expand a little more the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.500
 subject we are already with the doctor the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.140
 surgeon manuel casal started by 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.760
 welcome really serious we stay 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.079
 surprised by more than it happens to 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 often we see young people who are 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.319
 they inject this substance the known 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.890
 airplane oil actually that what 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.659
 they are injecting the body and the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.580
 plane oil that is commonly known 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:11.090
 It is a substance 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:14.440
 synthetic is a metal of locsa not based 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.110
 of silicon and what 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.040
 is coming it was already used in the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.860
 decade of the 50s 60 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.159
 but that began to have problems already in 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.450
 USA in the 70's was prohibited 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.069
 they have problems what are the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.599
 consequences for example for a young woman 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.500
 that that type of substance is injected into 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.269
 this case 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.469
 stephanie has been able to tell what has 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.510
 gone but we have seen that it has arrived 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.780
 even to the exact death there are cases 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.090
 there are cases already known of several cases that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.500
 have died for this problem what happens 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.290
 is that being an external substance he 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.599
 produces inflammatory reactions and 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.870
 relations to foreign bodies that can 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.989
 start in a few months until it has 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.939
 seen reactions that appeared 25-30 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.730
 years later 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.519
 ok but the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.250
 are two main causes of these 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.220
 serious cases one that is the infection 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.750
 because they can be products that are not 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.000
 properly sterilized 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.769
 then they produce reactions of 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 infection that can become 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.160
 systemic infection a sepsis and in 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.050
 consequence death 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.120
 and the other degree and case are the 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.270
 severe inflammatory reactions the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.680
 organism reacts to a body 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.340
 I miss with 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.949
 with your active immune system and produces 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.370
 a great inflammatory reaction that can 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.770
 produce complications and damage in 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.199
 different organs like liver lungs 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.570
 kidney base and seeing the consequences to 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.979
 see different cases you doctor thinks 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.750
 that I will be forbidden for example 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.160
 injected this type of substances is 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.720
 something legal in this case, what's done 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.759
 in the cosmiatra not but there 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.690
 institutions that do so in a way 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.729
 regular there is no the big question is 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.340
 why one gets complicated and because another one is 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.250
 high is not true you do not know you do not know 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.270
 still why is it supposed or is it because 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:15.449
 some do not but if this can produce 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.230
 the fact that it can produce should 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.860
 ban 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.920
 what also happens is that many times 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.080
 there are doctors who apply this did not put 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.140
 back same with my back even doctors 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.780
 and the worst of all is that many times 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.730
 both doctors and cosmiatras say that 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.910
 they are putting exact hyaluronic acid 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.040
 which is a substance that if allowed 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.690
 then saying that this has been and at 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.080
 ferret and ccoo put these 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.889
 substances these biopolymers 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.740
 and charge them a comfortable accessible price 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.960
 now the hyaluronic acid of good 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.569
 quality has really been gold 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.680
 Unique is a very expensive product one can 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.939
 to account for the difference 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.650
 prices for example how can a 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.870
 patient to recognize the acid 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.480
 Hyaluronic Airplane Oil 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.550
 and for those who do not know there is no reason why 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.500
 both are transparent the acid 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:14.100
 hyaluronic is a much more substance 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.100
 more consistent more more gel type 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.730
 the biopolymer or this liquid silicone 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.960
 it's like an oil now the patient in 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.090
 this sense has to be very insightful 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.280
 also not to pay attention to the price 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.860
 to the place where it is going to be attended and there 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.810
 be aware also of the history of 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.330
 doctor in this case who will apply the 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.940
 that's exactly why it's all 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.220
 this has been important this news 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.900
 this report because it allows us to call 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.990
 the attention in people to have 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.080
 careful because sometimes for a question 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.420
 of price choose to look for this type of 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.950
 unscrupulous people because you can not 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.290
 overcome things what would be your 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.020
 final recommendation doctor cachai for 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.180
 those young women in short I think that 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.440
 the surgeries sometimes do not have any 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.760
 specific to all we always want 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.550
 give us a little better to come out with 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.650
 not exact precaution the ideal is to search 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.740
 a professional a doctor who can more 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.270
 that can guide the in this sense 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.550
 a professional who may have 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.280
 experience in the use of products from 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.110
 filling materials but above all 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.480
 give him the guarantee that he is 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.400
 putting something 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.040
 that is not going to hurt him there is a 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.250
 medicine principle that is called what 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.960
 first is not to hurt then if one 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.730
 is going to be a treatment or anything 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.170
 who wants to do as a patient what 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.530
 first one you have to be sure 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.510
 is that what he's going to give him because he's going 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.730
 to be is not going to cause it to exist 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.770
 minimal chance of hurting the 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.390
 patient the last consultation nothing more 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.070
 we saw in the case this stephanie girl 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.990
 that they offered the service to 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.880
 address would have to entrust the first 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.760
 hand of those long because not that it's not going 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.440
 to the houses to do surgery that's because 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.870
 does not meet the conditions of sterility 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.880
 and asepsis that is needed for a 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.540
 procedure very well excellent author 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.540
 many thanks
