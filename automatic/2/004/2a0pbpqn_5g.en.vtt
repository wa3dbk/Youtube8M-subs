head is a lot larger then it's supposed
to<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> look<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.000> texture<00:00:35.300> we

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to be and if you look at the texture we

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.000 
to be and if you look at the texture we
can<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> its<00:00:38.250> jaw<00:00:38.730> line<00:00:39.030> here

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
can see that this is its jaw line here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.170 
can see that this is its jaw line here
right<00:00:41.010> here

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 

and<00:00:45.300> here's<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.200> top<00:00:46.380> of<00:00:46.560> its<00:00:46.710> mouth<00:00:46.950> right

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and here's the top of its mouth right

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.080 
and here's the top of its mouth right
under<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> eyes<00:00:48.020> in<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:50.040> screenshot<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
under the eyes in the screenshot this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
under the eyes in the screenshot this
enderman<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.780> opening<00:00:52.320> its<00:00:52.530> mouth<00:00:54.650> so<00:00:55.650> I've

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
enderman is opening its mouth so I've

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.210 
enderman is opening its mouth so I've
come<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.330> conclusion<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.960> they<00:00:58.830> open

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
come to the conclusion that they open

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.510 
come to the conclusion that they open
their<00:00:59.370> mouths<00:00:59.610> when<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.300> attack<00:01:00.950> now<00:01:01.950> as<00:01:02.129> for

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
their mouths when they attack now as for

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.650 
their mouths when they attack now as for
the<00:01:03.090> texture<00:01:03.629> inside<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.800> mouth<00:01:05.420> this<00:01:06.420> is

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
the texture inside the mouth this is

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.880 
the texture inside the mouth this is
also<00:01:06.840> very<00:01:07.560> confusing<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.690> found<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.500> what

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
also very confusing but I found out what

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
also very confusing but I found out what
it<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:13.050> can<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.440> here<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:15.440> these<00:01:16.440> two

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it is you can see here this these two

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.999 
it is you can see here this these two
dots<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.940> line<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.710> match<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
dots here and this line here match up

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
dots here and this line here match up
with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> back<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.780> ender<00:01:22.080> man's<00:01:22.290> head

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
with the back of the ender man's head

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
with the back of the ender man's head
and<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.410> here<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.009> large

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and then this right here this large

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.139 
and then this right here this large
black<00:01:27.000> line<00:01:28.850> matches<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.300> with<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.910> bottom<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
black line matches up with the bottom of

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.139 
black line matches up with the bottom of
it<00:01:33.330> said<00:01:34.070> those<00:01:35.070> come<00:01:35.399> together<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
it said those come together to make it

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.389 
it said those come together to make it
looked<00:01:39.149> like<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:40.020> under<00:01:40.229> man<00:01:40.380> has<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> nose<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
looked like the under man has a nose and

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.050 
looked like the under man has a nose and
lips<00:01:42.740> that's<00:01:43.740> what's<00:01:44.070> been<00:01:44.310> confusing<00:01:44.700> me<00:01:44.880> for

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
lips that's what's been confusing me for

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
lips that's what's been confusing me for
so<00:01:45.180> long<00:01:45.330> but<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> Enderman

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so long but it's actually the Enderman

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.359 
so long but it's actually the Enderman
opening<00:01:47.610> its<00:01:47.759> mouth<00:01:48.560> my<00:01:49.560> guess<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.159> they

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
opening its mouth my guess is they

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
opening its mouth my guess is they
haven't<00:01:50.580> come<00:01:50.940> up<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.780> texture<00:01:52.470> for

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
haven't come up with a texture for

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.700 
haven't come up with a texture for
inside<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.400> mouth<00:01:53.580> or<00:01:54.570> maybe<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.530> could

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
inside the mouth or maybe they could

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.760 
inside the mouth or maybe they could
have<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.190> red-hot<00:01:57.119> lava<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.990> lava<00:01:58.229> texture

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
have like red-hot lava the lava texture

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.429 
have like red-hot lava the lava texture
inside<00:01:58.890> them<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.850> cool<00:02:00.439> be

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
inside them out that would be cool be

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.870 
inside them out that would be cool be
really<00:02:01.979> creepy<00:02:02.220> but<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.700> would<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.880> cool<00:02:04.880> but

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
really creepy but that would be cool but

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.320 
really creepy but that would be cool but
that's<00:02:06.210> what<00:02:06.900> I've<00:02:07.020> discovered<00:02:08.330> endermen

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that's what I've discovered endermen

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.430 
that's what I've discovered endermen
open<00:02:09.720> their<00:02:09.899> mouths<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.679> attack

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
open their mouths when they attack

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.120 
open their mouths when they attack
alright<00:02:13.440> thanks<00:02:13.739> for<00:02:13.860> watching<00:02:14.220> good<00:02:14.940> night
