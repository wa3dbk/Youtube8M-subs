guitar tuning techniques another common
alternative<00:00:10.590> tuning<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> called<00:00:11.940> Dada<00:00:12.480> Dada

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
alternative tuning is called Dada Dada

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.140 
alternative tuning is called Dada Dada
is<00:00:13.170> basically<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> best<00:00:14.309> way<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.519> describe<00:00:14.910> it

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
is basically the best way to describe it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060 
is basically the best way to describe it
and<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.570> simply<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> strings<00:00:16.500> spell

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and that's simply what the strings spell

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.250 
and that's simply what the strings spell
out<00:00:17.279> when<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.420> finely<00:00:18.840> tuned<00:00:19.080> it's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
out when you have it finely tuned it's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.420 
out when you have it finely tuned it's
going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.619> D<00:00:19.890> ad<00:00:20.480> G<00:00:21.480> ad<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> way

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
going to be D ad G ad and so the way

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.920 
going to be D ad G ad and so the way
we're<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> way

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
we're going to get this is just the way

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.140 
we're going to get this is just the way
we've<00:00:25.109> been<00:00:25.140> doing<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:26.010> drop<00:00:26.430> D<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> with

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
we've been doing it with drop D and with

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.419 
we've been doing it with drop D and with
open<00:00:27.510> D<00:00:27.660> tuning<00:00:27.689> we're<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> drop<00:00:29.130> our

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
open D tuning we're going to drop our

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
open D tuning we're going to drop our
low<00:00:30.060> string<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> D

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
again I'm going to be going below it and

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.260 
again I'm going to be going below it and
coming<00:00:41.580> up<00:00:42.380> just<00:00:43.380> like<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.970> double

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
coming up just like so it's a double

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.030 
coming up just like so it's a double
check<00:00:45.480> again<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.380> seventh<00:00:46.800> fret

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
check again you go to the seventh fret

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.700 
check again you go to the seventh fret
of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.280> low<00:00:47.700> string<00:00:48.390> which<00:00:48.630> is<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> D<00:00:49.290> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of the low string which is now a D and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.010 
of the low string which is now a D and
that<00:00:50.580> should<00:00:50.850> match<00:00:51.060> your<00:00:51.480> fifth<00:00:51.780> string

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that should match your fifth string

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.790 
that should match your fifth string
we're<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.380> yet

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we're not there yet

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.370 
we're not there yet
so<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.370> bring<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.090> bit

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that sounds good so now the next two

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.660 
that sounds good so now the next two
strings<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.800> we're<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> change<00:01:08.400> are

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
strings that we're going to change are

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.310 
strings that we're going to change are
the<00:01:08.700> second<00:01:09.270> string<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> first<00:01:10.170> string

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the second string and the first string

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.870 
the second string and the first string
we're<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> second<00:01:11.670> string

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
we're going to take the second string

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
we're going to take the second string
which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.210> tuned<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.630> B<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.310> we're

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
which is tuned to a B right now we're

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
which is tuned to a B right now we're
going<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> bring<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.870> A<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.600> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
going to bring that down to an A and the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
going to bring that down to an A and the
way<00:01:18.720> we're<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> find<00:01:19.260> that<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.980> by

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
way we're going to find that is just by

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.670 
way we're going to find that is just by
playing<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:20.670> low<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.910> again<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.500> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
playing our low a again and then just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.450 
playing our low a again and then just
matching<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> pitch<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.680> again<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.250> always

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
matching the pitch and again I'm always

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.700 
matching the pitch and again I'm always
going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.760> go<00:01:29.910> below<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:31.080> come<00:01:31.860> back

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.950 

that<00:01:39.890> sounds<00:01:40.310> pretty<00:01:40.520> good<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:40.969> now<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.719> we

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
that sounds pretty good so now that we

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.230 
that sounds pretty good so now that we
have<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.289> being<00:01:42.560> an<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.490> find<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.939> next

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
have this being an a to find the next

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760 
have this being an a to find the next
note<00:01:44.539> also<00:01:44.960> we're<00:01:45.049> going<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> have<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.409> do<00:01:45.560> is

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
note also we're going to have to do is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.590 
note also we're going to have to do is
play<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> fifth<00:01:46.340> fret<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.969> second<00:01:47.570> string

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
play the fifth fret of the second string

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.080 
play the fifth fret of the second string
and<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.619> we're<00:01:48.920> going<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.070> take<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.549> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and then we're going to take that and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.020 
and then we're going to take that and
that'll<00:01:50.630> be<00:01:50.780> our<00:01:50.960> new<00:01:51.350> high<00:01:51.920> string<00:01:52.340> which<00:01:52.759> was

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
that'll be our new high string which was

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.230 
that'll be our new high string which was
an<00:01:53.210> e<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:53.899> going<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.079> be<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.259> D<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:58.149> so<00:01:59.149> I'm

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
an e and it's going to be a D and so I'm

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.370 
an e and it's going to be a D and so I'm
going<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.390> want<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.630> go<00:01:59.750> below<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:06.170> come

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to want to go below it and come

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to want to go below it and come
back<00:02:06.530> up

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
so now we have dadgad and when you strum

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.980 
so now we have dadgad and when you strum
it<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.580> should<00:02:22.760> sound<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.480> sort<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.870> a
