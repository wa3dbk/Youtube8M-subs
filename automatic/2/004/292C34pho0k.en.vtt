the easiest way to do it i think just
slide<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.350> again<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
slide one in you want again you want to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.200 
slide one in you want again you want to
get<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.989> there<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.119> where<00:01:06.119> it's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

get that there where the where it's
joined<00:01:06.450> put<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> bottom<00:01:08.900> looks<00:01:09.900> better<00:01:10.400> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
joined put on the bottom looks better so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.539 
joined put on the bottom looks better so
just<00:01:12.210> slide<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.100> real<00:01:14.100> good<00:01:14.310> fit<00:01:16.549> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
just slide this in real good fit and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.600 

once<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> click<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.860> notice<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.520> not

so<00:02:11.240> yeah<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.630> sneza<00:02:11.870> density<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.320> games

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
so yeah just sneza density for games

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.770 
so yeah just sneza density for games
these<00:02:12.770> fit<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.220> they<00:02:13.670> are<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.940> best<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.510> best

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
these fit and they are the best the best

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.890 
these fit and they are the best the best
idea<00:02:17.650> today<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.680> guys
