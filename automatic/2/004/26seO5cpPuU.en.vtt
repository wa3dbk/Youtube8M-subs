these<00:02:50.760> quarterbacks<00:02:51.120> although<00:02:51.629> am<00:02:52.079> I<00:02:52.290> you

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
these quarterbacks although am I you

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.679 
these quarterbacks although am I you
know<00:02:52.650> predictably<00:02:52.919> unpredictable<00:02:53.659> what<00:02:54.659> I

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
know predictably unpredictable what I

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.729 
know predictably unpredictable what I
always<00:02:54.930> say<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.349> both<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.560> these

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
always say that both of these

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.289 
always say that both of these
quarterbacks<00:02:56.069> are<00:02:56.340> certainly<00:02:56.639> capable<00:02:56.939> of

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
quarterbacks are certainly capable of

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.720 
quarterbacks are certainly capable of
having<00:02:57.419> spectacular<00:02:58.260> games<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.889> Detroit<00:02:59.609> has

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
having spectacular games but Detroit has

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.819 
having spectacular games but Detroit has
been<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.030> best<00:03:00.239> under<00:03:00.689> team<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.169> the<00:03:01.260> NFL<00:03:01.590> not

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
been the best under team in the NFL not

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.679 
been the best under team in the NFL not
only<00:03:02.099> by<00:03:02.219> what<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.519> public<00:03:02.939> generally

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
only by what the public generally

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.569 
only by what the public generally
considers<00:03:04.469> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.889> best<00:03:05.040> indicator

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
considers to be the best indicator

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.550 
considers to be the best indicator
they've<00:03:05.939> gone<00:03:06.120> under<00:03:06.510> 9<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.810> 11<00:03:06.870> that's<00:03:07.290> really

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
they've gone under 9 of 11 that's really

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.929 
they've gone under 9 of 11 that's really
not<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.739> best<00:03:07.889> indicator<00:03:08.489> but<00:03:08.669> they've<00:03:08.790> gone

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
not the best indicator but they've gone

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.030 
not the best indicator but they've gone
under<00:03:09.359> by<00:03:09.510> an<00:03:09.629> average<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.169> nine<00:03:10.439> point<00:03:10.739> six

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
under by an average of nine point six

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.220 
under by an average of nine point six
points<00:03:11.459> per<00:03:11.609> game<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:12.419> it<00:03:12.569> really<00:03:12.780> has<00:03:13.049> not

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
points per game so it really has not

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.559 
points per game so it really has not
been<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.769> fluke<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.730> Chicago<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.269> fact<00:03:15.480> that

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
been a fluke in Chicago the fact that

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.209 
been a fluke in Chicago the fact that
they're<00:03:15.780> off<00:03:15.900> consecutive<00:03:16.349> wins<00:03:16.829> even<00:03:17.040> though

they're off consecutive wins even though

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.680 
they're off consecutive wins even though
Jay<00:03:17.430> Cutler<00:03:17.729> hasn't<00:03:18.000> played<00:03:18.120> all<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.540> well

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
Jay Cutler hasn't played all that well

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.189 
Jay Cutler hasn't played all that well
but<00:03:18.870> generally<00:03:19.319> Jay<00:03:20.010> Cutler<00:03:20.459> plays<00:03:21.209> his<00:03:21.599> worse

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
but generally Jay Cutler plays his worse

over<00:04:27.939> under<00:04:28.090> on<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.509> road<00:04:28.719> and<00:04:29.050> Detroit's

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
over under on the road and Detroit's

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.320 
over under on the road and Detroit's
offense<00:04:29.800> does<00:04:30.039> seem<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.340> be<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:31.180> know<00:04:31.300> a

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
offense does seem to be you know a

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330 
offense does seem to be you know a
decent<00:04:31.930> amount<00:04:32.169> better<00:04:32.500> at<00:04:32.770> home<00:04:33.069> they<00:04:33.310> are

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
decent amount better at home they are

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.649 
decent amount better at home they are
two<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.729> nine<00:04:33.819> over<00:04:34.030> under<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.360> year<00:04:34.569> but

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
two and nine over under on the year but

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.390 
two and nine over under on the year but
they're<00:04:34.780> also<00:04:34.930> just<00:04:35.139> two<00:04:35.259> and<00:04:35.409> three<00:04:35.650> over

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
they're also just two and three over

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.309 
they're also just two and three over
under<00:04:36.550> at<00:04:36.879> home<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.569> so<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.900> look<00:04:38.110> at<00:04:38.199> their

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
under at home and so you look at their

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.719 
under at home and so you look at their
recent<00:04:38.710> final<00:04:38.979> scores<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:39.400> figured<00:04:39.699> that

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
recent final scores you figured that

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.309 
recent final scores you figured that
their<00:04:40.000> offense<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.479> probably<00:04:40.900> going<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.080> step

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
their offense is probably going to step

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.260 
their offense is probably going to step
it<00:04:41.439> up<00:04:41.500> here<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.710> bit<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.159> see<00:04:42.699> them<00:04:42.849> putting<00:04:43.030> up

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
it up here a bit I see them putting up

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.300 
it up here a bit I see them putting up
but<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:43.659> know<00:04:43.780> somewhere<00:04:44.229> at<00:04:44.379> least<00:04:44.620> in<00:04:44.860> the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
but you know somewhere at least in the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.790 
but you know somewhere at least in the
20s<00:04:45.759> in<00:04:46.000> this<00:04:46.479> one<00:04:46.719> and<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.409> know<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.680> the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
20s in this one and you know on the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.709 
20s in this one and you know on the
short<00:04:48.099> week<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.939> know<00:04:49.030> if<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.479> bears

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719 
short week you know if that bears

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.659 
short week you know if that bears
offense<00:04:50.139> if<00:04:50.289> Cutler<00:04:50.740> starts<00:04:51.039> to<00:04:51.189> click<00:04:51.400> if<00:04:51.610> you

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
offense if Cutler starts to click if you

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.580 
offense if Cutler starts to click if you
know<00:04:51.909> if<00:04:52.120> Detroit's<00:04:52.719> defenses<00:04:53.199> worn<00:04:53.379> down<00:04:53.530> a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
know if Detroit's defenses worn down a

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.200 
know if Detroit's defenses worn down a
little<00:04:53.800> bit<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.159> Cutler<00:04:54.729> starts<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.060> click

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
little bit and Cutler starts to click

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.730 
little bit and Cutler starts to click
with<00:04:55.270> his<00:04:55.509> receivers<00:04:55.990> they<00:04:56.379> can<00:04:56.560> put<00:04:56.710> up

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
with his receivers they can put up

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.709 
with his receivers they can put up
points<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:57.189> a<00:04:57.250> hurry<00:04:57.460> Detroit<00:04:58.150> softens<00:04:58.509> try<00:04:58.689> a

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
points in a hurry Detroit softens try a

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.059 
points in a hurry Detroit softens try a
little<00:04:58.930> bit<00:04:59.110> better<00:04:59.199> at<00:04:59.409> home<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.710> could<00:04:59.889> see

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
little bit better at home I could see

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.369 
little bit better at home I could see
this<00:05:00.219> one<00:05:00.430> climbing<00:05:01.270> at<00:05:01.360> some<00:05:01.569> point<00:05:01.810> over<00:05:01.960> the

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
this one climbing at some point over the

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.899 
this one climbing at some point over the
over<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.770> total<00:05:03.009> I<00:05:03.129> did<00:05:03.310> think<00:05:03.520> about<00:05:03.580> this

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
over the total I did think about this

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.089 
over the total I did think about this
yeah<00:05:04.330> well<00:05:04.659> color<00:05:05.319> hasn't<00:05:05.590> been<00:05:05.860> clicking

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
yeah well color hasn't been clicking

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.890 
yeah well color hasn't been clicking
really<00:05:06.430> with<00:05:06.699> his<00:05:06.849> receivers<00:05:07.389> all<00:05:07.569> that<00:05:07.750> much

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
really with his receivers all that much

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.510 
really with his receivers all that much
this<00:05:08.169> year<00:05:08.229> so<00:05:08.590> that's<00:05:08.770> kind<00:05:09.009> of<00:05:09.069> a<00:05:09.189> big<00:05:09.340> f

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
this year so that's kind of a big f

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.369 
this year so that's kind of a big f
aggressive<00:05:10.000> mandatory<00:05:10.539> their<00:05:11.080> best

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
aggressive mandatory their best

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.379 
aggressive mandatory their best
offensive<00:05:11.860> lineman<00:05:12.460> Riley<00:05:12.879> Reiff<00:05:13.120> he's

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
offensive lineman Riley Reiff he's

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.089 
offensive lineman Riley Reiff he's
pleased<00:05:13.810> questionable<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.800> now<00:05:14.889> there's

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
pleased questionable and now there's

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.469 
pleased questionable and now there's
some<00:05:15.219> reports<00:05:15.580> he<00:05:15.669> could<00:05:15.849> be<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.360> a

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
some reports he could be in a

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.089 
some reports he could be in a
questionable<00:05:16.990> but<00:05:17.139> doubtful<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:17.740> that's<00:05:17.889> all

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
questionable but doubtful so that's all

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.800 
questionable but doubtful so that's all
so<00:05:18.310> big<00:05:18.580> now<00:05:18.819> I<00:05:18.849> don't<00:05:19.150> think<00:05:19.360> either<00:05:19.509> either

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
so big now I don't think either either

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.420 
so big now I don't think either either
one<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.110> these<00:05:20.289> quarterbacks<00:05:20.919> have<00:05:21.250> been

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
one of these quarterbacks have been

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.640 
one of these quarterbacks have been
clicking<00:05:22.120> very<00:05:22.509> much<00:05:22.779> this<00:05:23.050> year<00:05:23.110> but<00:05:23.529> again

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
clicking very much this year but again

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.499 
clicking very much this year but again
as<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.039> said<00:05:24.069> both<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.550> these<00:05:24.759> defenses<00:05:25.389> have

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
as I said both of these defenses have

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.839 
as I said both of these defenses have
been<00:05:25.539> tremendous<00:05:26.169> especially<00:05:26.889> so<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:27.729> know

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
been tremendous especially so you know

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.610 
been tremendous especially so you know
Detroit's<00:05:28.210> defense<00:05:28.689> has<00:05:28.810> been<00:05:28.990> great<00:05:29.199> overall

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
Detroit's defense has been great overall

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.680 
Detroit's defense has been great overall
and<00:05:29.979> Chicago<00:05:30.789> their<00:05:30.939> only<00:05:31.150> struggles<00:05:31.569> have

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
and Chicago their only struggles have

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.140 
and Chicago their only struggles have
been<00:05:31.719> against<00:05:32.289> fantastic<00:05:33.099> offenses<00:05:33.969> which

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
been against fantastic offenses which

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.670 
been against fantastic offenses which
they're<00:05:34.330> not<00:05:34.449> going<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:34.990> see<00:05:35.169> here<00:05:35.409> but<00:05:35.500> yeah

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
they're not going to see here but yeah

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.860 
they're not going to see here but yeah

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
again you know as I always say there's

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.420 
again you know as I always say there's
no<00:05:38.050> such<00:05:38.080> thing<00:05:38.319> as<00:05:38.589> a<00:05:38.680> sure<00:05:38.710> thing<00:05:39.129> that's<00:05:39.310> why

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
no such thing as a sure thing that's why

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.740 
no such thing as a sure thing that's why
you're<00:05:39.610> not<00:05:39.699> going<00:05:39.909> to<00:05:39.969> hear<00:05:40.120> me<00:05:40.270> say<00:05:40.509> that<00:05:40.539> you

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
you're not going to hear me say that you

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.290 
you're not going to hear me say that you
know<00:05:40.839> bet<00:05:41.139> your<00:05:41.319> life<00:05:41.740> on<00:05:42.009> this<00:05:42.219> and<00:05:42.849> what<00:05:43.089> not

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
know bet your life on this and what not

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.180 
know bet your life on this and what not
both<00:05:43.900> of<00:05:44.080> these<00:05:44.169> quarterbacks<00:05:44.529> are<00:05:44.830> certainly

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
both of these quarterbacks are certainly

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.939 
both of these quarterbacks are certainly
capable<00:05:45.580> of<00:05:46.199> coming<00:05:47.199> up<00:05:47.259> with<00:05:47.319> great<00:05:47.589> games

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
capable of coming up with great games

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.010 
capable of coming up with great games
every<00:05:48.699> now<00:05:48.849> and<00:05:49.060> then<00:05:49.210> but<00:05:49.240> as<00:05:49.509> far<00:05:49.690> as<00:05:49.750> the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
every now and then but as far as the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.629 
every now and then but as far as the
percentages<00:05:50.589> say<00:05:50.830> no<00:05:51.039> I<00:05:51.069> don't<00:05:51.400> think<00:05:51.550> that's

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
percentages say no I don't think that's

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.249
