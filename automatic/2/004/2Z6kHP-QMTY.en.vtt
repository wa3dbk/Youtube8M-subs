00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
be facing that way so you can see where

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.929 
be facing that way so you can see where
you're<00:01:32.329> going<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.920> then<00:01:34.070> also<00:01:34.280> helps<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.790> get

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
you're going and then also helps you get

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.020 
you're going and then also helps you get
the<00:01:35.150> momentum<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:36.189> pop<00:01:37.189> out<00:01:37.400> again<00:01:37.700> at<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.000> end

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the momentum to pop out again at the end

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.800 
the momentum to pop out again at the end
so<00:01:39.250> main<00:01:40.250> thing<00:01:40.460> is<00:01:40.490> just<00:01:40.939> try<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.420> keep<00:01:41.600> your

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
so main thing is just try to keep your

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.510 
so main thing is just try to keep your
balance<00:01:42.159> once<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.280> get<00:01:43.430> on<00:01:43.549> their<00:01:45.310> face<00:01:46.310> the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
balance once you get on their face the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.780 
balance once you get on their face the
direction<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.000> you're<00:01:47.210> going<00:01:47.420> obviously

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.389 

get<00:01:52.790> moderate<00:01:53.570> speed<00:01:54.140> I'll<00:01:54.680> start<00:01:55.009> out<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
get moderate speed I'll start out to the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.240 
get moderate speed I'll start out to the
fast<00:01:56.049> try<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:57.110> on<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.320> curb<00:01:57.590> or<00:01:57.770> something<00:01:58.130> you

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
fast try it on a curb or something you

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.020 
fast try it on a curb or something you
know<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:59.229> straight<00:02:00.229> at<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:00.740> way<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.250> hope

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
know just straight at it this way I hope

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.539 
know just straight at it this way I hope
you<00:02:02.180> get<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.450> rotation<00:02:02.930> down<00:02:03.079> really<00:02:03.320> well<00:02:03.549> go

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
you get the rotation down really well go

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.240 
you get the rotation down really well go
to<00:02:04.729> curb<00:02:05.030> go<00:02:05.240> like<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.930> try<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.829> land<00:02:07.070> in

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
to curb go like this and try to land in

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.220 
to curb go like this and try to land in
the<00:02:07.340> backside<00:02:07.759> tail<00:02:08.030> on

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.670 

so<00:02:12.230> let's<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.830> recap<00:02:13.250> real<00:02:13.490> quick<00:02:14.230> got<00:02:15.230> your

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
so let's just recap real quick got your

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.780 
so let's just recap real quick got your
write-up<00:02:16.480> slight<00:02:17.480> angle<00:02:18.220> pop<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.250> little<00:02:19.610> bit

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
write-up slight angle pop a little bit

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.370 
write-up slight angle pop a little bit
before<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.470> don't<00:02:21.620> catch<00:02:22.480> start<00:02:23.480> twisting

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
before so you don't catch start twisting

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.320 
before so you don't catch start twisting
