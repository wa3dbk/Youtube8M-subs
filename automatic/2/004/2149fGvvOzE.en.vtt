00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:15.110
 today I will show the gain of mercosul no 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:15.110
 has 900 lines of the weak 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 It is a great event x10 the daughter and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.849
 put the pattern of it one thousand of the 50 thousand and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.730
 five hundred 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:41.280
 so I 'm going to give you a test called 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:44.120
 8h performance here and you vehicles 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.120
 in stock 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.630
 in a very small thesis it will end here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.630
 just now 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 and it's good, you can see her 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.990
 I do not know if they're going to be just a girl with 86 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.460
 five points ahead of the battle ever 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.460
 type of event because of 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.520
 probably the incident but it is more 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:40.030
 silent first video can see that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:43.090
 before the time sticking in the minor 50 to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.430
 my gtx 650 passed smaller then 50 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.120
 This good one would say very biased to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.660
 nobody 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:02:00.900
 now let's increase the safe let's go 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:02:00.900
 put memory 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 1.3 of will and oliver 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 and they say take over seven years let's see which 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 went well 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.580
 andrÃ© 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.290
 96 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.580
 can see that comes ten principles only gave 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.920
 a simple package probably in the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.190
 time I say have pasted Brazilian is 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.000
 getting hot in the 1990s did not 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:27.850
 comments more students we will put cup 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.790
 In the game, I do not know if it's going to stay. 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:38.019
 I never cut you down, it's too loud. 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:40.470
 havana 19 30 in the drop we 'll see if 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.470
 it will be good 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:54.569
 remembering that this touch of 86 with 57 96 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.569
 23 points more but estrella 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.780
 The block is not heating up. I put it here. 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.780
 I also do not do it so hot 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.060
 let's see the result 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:30.419
 99.7 ie the temperature of the bread let 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:33.660
 see how many expect to reach the maximum of 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:43.470
 53 god does not see and in egypt 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:46.410
 The 56th good for anyone here is a good 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.800
 man around 50 with 1500 chairs 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.240
 discovered and treated as well as 3 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.039
 difference 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.770
 Of course this is no big deal but already 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.419
 you can understand that overclocking is 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.750
 you are a little weaker 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.430
 to win a lot of money you can stay 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.180
 quite get out of here 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.180
 this is it people
