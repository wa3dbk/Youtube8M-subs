00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and the news by the way of the latest 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.180
 hours and that has hit not only 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 venezuela but also to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370
 Latin America and the world in general was 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 Hugo Chavez's death yet 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 prior to the information given by the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.670
 vice president nicolás matured the same 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 in a long press conference hours 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 before he spoke and somehow he re-floated 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 the possibility that the Bolivarian leader 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.160
 have been killed have something 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.929
 poisoned and good he remembered the case 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 of the former leader of the national authority 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.870
 palestine yaser arafat where there is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 done in concrete situations 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.719
 to which apparently the Palestinian leader 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.250
 would have been poisoned hugo chávez died 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.649
 or he was murdered there is a conspiracy 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.640
 behind this pay attention because 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.640
 the next note we tell you 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.790
 at 58 and after more than a year and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.220
 half fighting against a cancer died 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.290
 the Venezuelan president hugo chávez in 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.440
 medium of a serious and great controversy 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.930
 the president who was for more than 14 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.000
 years in command of the South American country had 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.220
 have to face four operations against 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.380
 his illness which opened the doubts in 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.930
 your environment about a possible 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.740
 external intervention in its delicate 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.660
 health once the commander died 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.300
 hugo chávez the statements of 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.040
 mature nicolás vice president accentuates 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.340
 even more the doubts of a possible 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.330
 conspiracy against us not 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 we have no doubt 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.450
 and the indicated moment of the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.080
 history that can be shaped 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.710
 scientific commission that the commander 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.250
 chávez 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.310
 he was attacked with temperament 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.890
 he publicly manifested his vision 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.770
 about this theme 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.180
 and we have no doubt in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.990
 the historical enemies of our 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.970
 fatherland sought the point to damage the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.880
 health of our commander some 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.700
 official of the US embassy has 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.100
 done in a concept way an area in 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.770
 last weeks against the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.319
 military stability and political 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.590
 our country 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.280
 this official has been given the task of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 look for active military in venezuela 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.040
 this military is called is the aggregate 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.269
 aerial david of the Monaco and has been 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.730
 expelled has 24 hours to pick up 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.980
 your bags and leave venezuela not 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.379
 declarations seem preposterous 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.450
 from the nicolás vice president mature to the 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.810
 time to analyze the background that 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.669
 and six Latin American leaders 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.290
 idealists of the left have suffered from 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.750
 the damages of cancer 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.299
 with many reservations the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.090
 case of fidel Castro who in July 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.549
 year 2006 had to move away from power 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.849
 for a serious illness that is believed to 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.829
 is cancerous in August 2010 was the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.099
 then Paraguayan president Fernando 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.890
 61 year old man who gave the news 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.799
 who suffered from cancer coincidentally 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.230
 Former President Luis Ignacio Lula da 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.810
 Silva was also diagnosed in his 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.180
 case with a tumor in the larynx and its 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.970
 successor to the current president dilma 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.549
 Rouseff also suffered a similar 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.600
 disease affecting a cancer in the 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.350
 lymphatic system in the year 2009 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.910
 these strange coincidences 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.830
 they definitely turn on the alarm and 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.080
 causes doubts that do not allow 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.900
 rule out a possible conspiracy in 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.360
 against these presidents can not 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.820
 go unnoticed in this analysis the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.250
 condition of leftists who possess 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.160
 these leaders who make up a 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.980
 true network opposing the regime of 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.330
 the usa 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.530
 unfinished for many remained death 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.720
 by yaser arafat 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.030
 the Palestinian nationalist leader to whom 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.599
 Suddenly he was affected by a serious 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.060
 disease there will be a country behind that 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.890
 could somehow induce these 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.680
 diseases to opposition leaders 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.840
 politicians there would be an active 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.269
 organization used to attack this 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.160
 How responsible are the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.350
 words that hints nicolás 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.500
 matured about the death of hugo 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.510
 rafael chávez many questions still without 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.510
 a clear answer 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.390
 well this forgives this is not so 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.340
 crazy because not for being a tourist 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.230
 but simply to attract the news 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.990
 chile is these days judge mario 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.910
 float that requested the exhumation of 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.260
 the remains of Pablo Neruda that always 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.450
 it was thought that he had died from cancer 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.070
 of prostate but apparently they had 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.080
 background after the declaration of 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.340
 your former driver who would have been 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.410
 poisoned what happened to the ex 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.120
 president eduardo frei montalva and so 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.340
 you start to see arms in different 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.590
 parts of the world not only yaser arafat the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.630
 presides paraguay the president of 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.310
 argentina the former president brazil but 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.780
 that also the own buzzi obviously 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.000
 these statements by mature nicholas 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.870
 Calderón Alto y Usa did not delay nor 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.820
 minutes to describe as absurd this 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.950
 idea that hugo had gotten sick 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.900
 Chávez I 'm sorry it's not whimsical 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.750
 salfate prolonged side hugo chávez el 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.920
 year 2011 to see who several presidents 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.260
 of Latin America were suffering 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.140
 cancer gave an understanding that effectively 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.640
 an enemy power giving understanding that 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.760
 it was usa could have developed 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.430
 even a weapon to cause so be 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.400
 certain Latin American president who 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.650
 they did not agree with their policy 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.509
 there is a project that has never been known 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.770
 the name of the whole that after the 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:47.300
 Second World War understanding the 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.550
 physical problems that brought a 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.470
 radiation after throwing the bomb 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.750
 atomic in hiroshima and nagasaki that 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.850
 they could try to develop that ring 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.949
 just as there are other ways to create 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.690
 artificial tsunami or earthquake also 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.389
 the idea, however fantastic it may seem 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.430
 is the idea of ​​making contact with some 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.860
 first president that he bothers by 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.440
 example north america and put it say to 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.940
 disposition of some system or elements 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.039
 radioactive that somehow could 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.150
 create a chaotic system for example those 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.460
 lymphatic problems that is where 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.320
 rightly actor in the first part or 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.430
 either from the amygdala back or pnv up 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.940
 the legs or it would not be so 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.340
 crazy this posture of the said the 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.560
 2011 told him that the same Castro 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.199
 I had said I heard you careless is 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.139
 overtaking the US they have developed 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.590
 very powerful weapons and be careful what 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.590
 what are you eating 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.060
 fidelity and above all it works in a 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.680
 accident during the meal number know 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.060
 exactly what was easier to strain from 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.860
 any type of hair 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.600
 this theory that for many can be 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.830
 very crazy but that within the 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.600
 possibilities of one of the conditions 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.400
 that causes reactivity because as 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.169
 says julita he also referred to that 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.250
 same year to a project he saw in 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:00.590
 guatemala that the USA was approaching a 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.900
 hundred of Guatemalans who 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:06.350
 they arranged things and they had as certain 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.880
 health problems and there this generates 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.350
 I doubt that I could make that what you 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.790
 was affecting the good for the 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.919
 highly good there are many projects 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.480
 this guy as civil servants there are some 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.340
 experiments that even this weakness 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.440
 and it tells us where people are 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.479
 subject to being deprived of certain 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.040
 properties of the immune system 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.200
 and unless you every certain amount 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.389
 now I'm going to inject something they make you 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.680
 obviously dependent on something they are 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.510
 experiments that were developed to 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.090
 the late 80's and that today 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.190
 they achieved let's say completely action or 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.830
 evolve could make you sick 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.740
 specific person oxidize the 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.080
 rest to the environment and good can be a 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.610
 possibility now is not so crazy 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.180
 then governance mostly because 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:51.520
 during that year during 2011 it was not 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:54.050
 Only Hugo Chávez was the president of 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.740
 Cristina Fernandez in Argentina too 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.740
 they were left 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:04.030
 to think that it was not so crazy 

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:04.030
 what hugo chávez postulates
