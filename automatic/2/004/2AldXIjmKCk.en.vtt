00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.180
 handy video tutorial in this video 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.470
 tutorials for those people who 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.139
 they start using or they have changed 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.640
 from windows 7 to windows 8 or windows 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.560
 xp to windows 8 and need for good 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 using windows 8 well this video 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.529
 tutorial for those people who 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.239
 take time using windows 8 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 surely you will not need to see the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.130
 video tutorial then it's made for 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.900
 let's say for beginners well this 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.900
 video is related to the subject of 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.430
 capture our desktop or do 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.950
 screenshots on the desktop and for 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.560
 those that you used the windows 7 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.900
 We knew that by pressing the key in 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.730
 and then opening the program the paint 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.450
 copying and pasting so we made a 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.190
 capture of 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.010
 of the desktop well with windows 8 not 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.390
 we are going to need it simply with 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.670
 press two keys that I am going to show you 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.410
 then let's do the capture 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.050
 and it's not going to save it directly anymore 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.560
 in the images well said that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.670
 let's start with the video tutorial 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.340
 well the first thing we're going to do to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.140
 capture on the desk as you already 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.860
 We were commenting on pressing the symbol 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.570
 windows and let's press break well it 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 they fix that the screen has darkened 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.250
 they have already made the capture of the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.110
 screen and see where he left us 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.720
 that catch we're going to go to libraries the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.660
 we have here below the folder we open 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.540
 and here in this library window 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.240
 let's go to images and here we have 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 the capture that I made several 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.460
 catches to show them how it has been 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.890
 let's open it with the vision 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.270
 windows photo viewer and well 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.580
 this would be the capture that I just 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.580
 perform well let's close 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 and close a library well for the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.850
 second capture options 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.110
 desk and it's much more practical to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.200
 this option then for those people 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.270
 who want to do jobs while 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.619
 move as in the computer or want 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.530
 you can just make a video 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.489
 tutorial with screenshots of the desktop 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 Well what we do we will 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.920
 press the windows symbol and rr.ii 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 new opens the window to run less 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.470
 that we are here the window of 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.090
 execute what we are going to do we are going to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.760
 write ps 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.610
 and I have here psr post and we give 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.590
 accept ok now open the recording of 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.970
 user action and what we're going to 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.370
 do we are going to configure here to the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.970
 right let's take off and let's go to 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.980
 configuration 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.860
 but to which we are here in configuration 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.180
 here we mark or leave a mark or yes and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.950
 here we can put the catches that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.340
 we want to store it in this case it puts 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 25 we could put what we need 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.470
 comes the output file we give 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.050
 examine 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.640
 and not open the save window and we're going 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.810
 to decide what we want to put you in 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 this case I will put proof 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.330
 we leave it as a zip file and in 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.250
 images if we give to save 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.470
 once we save we give to accept 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.640
 and what we are going to do now is start 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.630
 the recording I will do a kind of 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.450
 video I will be recording several captures 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.300
 so they can see how they look like we have 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.780
 start and minimize automatically already 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.680
 started to capture on the desk 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.680
 let's go move by moving 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.030
 and every time we go we click us 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.540
 to go capturing the desktop in this 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.310
 case we are going to move 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.579
 if you notice that a color symbol comes out 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.909
 red is every time we press we are going to 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.340
 capture that image well once you 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.459
 we have already decided that we have 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.159
 finished our work we are going to 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.290
 capture the image to finish in the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.060
 task and for that we are going to give it to have 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.130
 recording 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.900
 let's see finished now let's see the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.770
 result in the end we will open another 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.810
 time again libraries and images well 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.069
 Here we have created a test file 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.560
 with a name that I have put in weird 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.500
 let's open and here we have another 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.420
 file then we execute 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.000
 and not open a window like it's the 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.710
 browser and here we have already captures 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.769
 that I made while doing the 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.000
 video-tutorial 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.510
 well if you fix the principle of the photo 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.870
 of each image puts them 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.530
 action 1 the date the time and the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.480
 User keyboard entry in win 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.370
 here in the second for good start of 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.930
 mouse drag the user of the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.480
 keyboard on the window screen well 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.750
 is showing us the actions that we are going 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.220
 performing comes once we can go 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.990
 testing these review the steps to 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.690
 next is a good record in him 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.270
 we click and here it will not happen 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.720
 automatic captures see what's going on 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.480
 from a moon until it ends we return 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.330
 back and in the third option that 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.920
 get review the additional details 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.530
 Here we will mark the details that 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.440
 I commented on each image 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.960
 the user keyboard input action 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.600
 pressing the wing key and so on 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.670
 It s good for nothing 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.460
 simple and practical good for those 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.050
 people who need it who want it 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.280
 Do some work or want to do

 virtue thor and they simply with 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.600
 desktop images because it's very 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.090
 simple now therefore working with 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.970
 friends, I hope it helps you and
