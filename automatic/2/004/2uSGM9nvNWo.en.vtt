00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
people have to call on so when you have

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.160 
people have to call on so when you have
the<00:00:35.070> collar<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.609> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.239> starting<00:00:36.899> from<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the collar on and then starting from the

color and measuring down to the tail to
the<00:00:40.199> base<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.409> the<00:00:40.679> hotel<00:00:41.069> it<00:00:42.030> makes<00:00:42.569> a

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
the base of the hotel it makes a

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.719 
the base of the hotel it makes a
difference<00:00:43.229> when<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.589> dogs<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.159> the<00:00:44.309> sitting

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
difference when the dogs in the sitting

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.779 
difference when the dogs in the sitting
position<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.600> laying<00:00:46.379> down<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.100> measurement

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
position or laying down the measurement

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.819 
position or laying down the measurement
could<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.269> just<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> two<00:00:49.379> inches

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
could be just one to two inches

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.549 
could be just one to two inches
difference<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.269> if<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> sitting<00:00:52.019> up<00:00:52.229> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
difference but if the sitting up and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.919 
difference but if the sitting up and
this<00:00:53.280> probably<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.539> able<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.839> be

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
this probably you're gonna be able to be

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.610 
this probably you're gonna be able to be
shorter<00:00:55.409> so<00:00:56.059> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.479> that<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:58.049> is<00:00:58.229> okay

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
shorter so if you do that which is okay
