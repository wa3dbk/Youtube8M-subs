misleading fit on Raw because you're not
fit<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.850> I'll<00:00:20.939> cover<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.330> channel<00:00:21.630> name<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
fit so I'll cover the channel name and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
fit so I'll cover the channel name and
fitness<00:00:22.350> videos<00:00:22.650> later<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.150> video

fitness videos later on in this video
but<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.260> want<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.949> look<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.210> notion

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
but first I want to look at this notion

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.009 
but first I want to look at this notion
that<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.910> ascertain<00:00:29.910> someone's<00:00:30.510> fitness

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that you can ascertain someone's fitness

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.260 
that you can ascertain someone's fitness
level<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.560> by<00:00:31.740> looking<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.189> them<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:33.030> can't

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
level just by looking at them you can't

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.290 
level just by looking at them you can't
you<00:00:33.960> can't<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.520> someone's<00:00:35.520> fitness<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.090> how

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you can't know someone's fitness or how

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
you can't know someone's fitness or how
fit<00:00:36.600> someone<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:37.559> looking<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:37.980> them

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
fit someone is just by looking at them

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
fit someone is just by looking at them
just<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.940> can't<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.870> someone<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
just like you can't know if someone is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
just like you can't know if someone is
healthy<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.670> by<00:00:41.760> looking<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.210> them

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
healthy or not just by looking at them

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
healthy or not just by looking at them
you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.960> someone<00:00:43.290> who<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.440> skinny<00:00:43.860> doesn't

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you know someone who is skinny doesn't

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
you know someone who is skinny doesn't
automatically<00:00:45.239> mean<00:00:45.480> they're<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> healthy

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
automatically mean they're a healthy

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.600 
automatically mean they're a healthy
it's<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.010> how<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> works

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it's just not how it works

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's just not how it works
instead<00:00:48.539> doctors<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.100> rely<00:00:50.430> on

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
instead doctors and the like rely on

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
instead doctors and the like rely on
measurable<00:00:51.120> factors<00:00:51.570> things<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.020> LDL

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
measurable factors things like LDL

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
measurable factors things like LDL
cholesterol<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.219> blood<00:00:53.699> pressure<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
cholesterol and blood pressure and it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.920 
cholesterol and blood pressure and it's
no<00:00:54.989> different<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.379> physical<00:00:56.340> fitness

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
no different with physical fitness

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.849 
no different with physical fitness
actually<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> crossover

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
actually there's a lot of crossover

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
actually there's a lot of crossover
between<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.309> two<00:00:59.550> since<00:00:59.820> fit<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.600> synonymous

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
between the two since fit is synonymous

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.200 
between the two since fit is synonymous
with<00:01:01.350> health<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.670> tend<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> think

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
with health but I think we tend to think

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
with health but I think we tend to think
of<00:01:03.420> fit<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.019> terms<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.439> physical<00:01:04.890> fitness<00:01:05.010> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
of fit in terms of physical fitness in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
of fit in terms of physical fitness in
terms<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> exercise<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.830> I'll<00:01:07.920> be

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
terms of exercise so that's all I'll be

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
terms of exercise so that's all I'll be
using<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.780> if

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
using it here so how do you know if

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
using it here so how do you know if
you're<00:01:10.020> fit<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.439> fitness<00:01:11.189> test<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.729> a

I<00:02:04.799> did<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.820> benchpress<00:02:06.299> where<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.409> bench<00:02:07.799> for

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
I did the benchpress where you bench for

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.219 
I did the benchpress where you bench for
women<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.670> 35<00:02:09.119> pounds<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:09.750> men<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> believe

women it's 35 pounds for men I believe

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.190 
women it's 35 pounds for men I believe
it's<00:02:10.379> 80<00:02:10.590> pounds<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.610> did<00:02:11.849> 35<00:02:12.180> pounds

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

I'm<00:03:37.170> not<00:03:37.519> naturally<00:03:38.519> very<00:03:38.639> flexible<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.480> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
I'm not naturally very flexible and I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.289 
I'm not naturally very flexible and I
don't<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:40.799> anything<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.549> become<00:03:41.730> more

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.090 
don't do anything to become more
flexible<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.109> only<00:03:43.319> stretching<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.769> do<00:03:43.829> is

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
flexible the only stretching I do is

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.099 
flexible the only stretching I do is
like<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> little<00:03:44.489> bit<00:03:44.700> after<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.209> workout<00:03:45.780> I

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
like a little bit after I workout I

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.830 
like a little bit after I workout I
don't<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.829> take<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.100> day<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.850> yoga<00:03:48.720> or

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
don't like take a day to do yoga or

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.150

stretching or anything like that I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.580 
stretching or anything like that I
probably<00:03:50.819> should<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.200> don't

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
probably should but I don't

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
so much attention to I pay more

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.110 
so much attention to I pay more
attention<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.540> next<00:04:00.690> one<00:04:01.730> 23.7<00:04:02.730> which<00:04:02.970> is

considered normal and waist
circumference<00:04:05.489> which<00:04:05.880> was<00:04:06.269> 30<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:07.019> me

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
circumference which was 30 for me

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.559 
circumference which was 30 for me
ideally<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.980> want<00:04:08.280> below<00:04:08.819> half<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.419> your

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
ideally you want below half of your

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.409 
ideally you want below half of your
height<00:04:09.840> which<00:04:10.200> would<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.650> 32<00:04:11.160> inches<00:04:11.970> for<00:04:12.269> me

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
height which would be 32 inches for me

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.120 
height which would be 32 inches for me
so<00:04:13.200> 30<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.709> good<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.030> nothing<00:04:15.750> special<00:04:16.130> I'm

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
so 30 is good so nothing special I'm

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.060 
so 30 is good so nothing special I'm
certainly<00:04:17.810> clearly<00:04:18.810> obviously<00:04:19.680> not<00:04:19.950> an

certainly clearly obviously not an

certainly clearly obviously not an

I'm<00:04:22.140> just<00:04:22.470> looking<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.800> be<00:04:23.130> fit<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:24.360> seems

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
I'm just looking to be fit and it seems

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.200 
I'm just looking to be fit and it seems
that<00:04:24.780> what<00:04:24.960> I'm<00:04:25.080> doing<00:04:25.440> has<00:04:25.770> how

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
that what I'm doing has how

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.999 
that what I'm doing has how
we<00:04:26.330> achieve<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:27.289> course<00:04:27.740> there<00:04:27.979> are

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
we achieve that of course there are

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.860 
we achieve that of course there are
improvements<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:28.940> could<00:04:29.300> make<00:04:29.509> if<00:04:29.750> I

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
improvements that I could make if I

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.580 
improvements that I could make if I
wanted<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:31.280> glaring<00:04:31.580> one<00:04:31.880> being<00:04:32.120> with

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
wanted to the glaring one being with

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.810 
wanted to the glaring one being with
flexibility<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> could<00:04:34.070> probably<00:04:34.280> spend<00:04:34.729> a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
flexibility I could probably spend a

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.120 
flexibility I could probably spend a
little<00:04:34.910> bit<00:04:35.060> more<00:04:35.180> time<00:04:35.949> stretching<00:04:36.949> and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
little bit more time stretching and

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.890 
little bit more time stretching and
doing<00:04:37.190> things<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.729> improve<00:04:38.090> my<00:04:38.300> flexibility

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
doing things to improve my flexibility

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.390 
doing things to improve my flexibility
but<00:04:39.470> that's<00:04:39.590> not<00:04:39.740> really<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.070> point<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.310> this

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
but that's not really the point of this

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.740 
but that's not really the point of this
video<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.820> point<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.090> this<00:04:41.150> video<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.600> that

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
video the point of this video is that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.300 
video the point of this video is that
you<00:04:41.810> would<00:04:42.110> not<00:04:42.229> have<00:04:42.440> gotten<00:04:42.620> any<00:04:42.949> of<00:04:43.160> that

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
you would not have gotten any of that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.850 
you would not have gotten any of that
just<00:04:43.759> by<00:04:44.000> looking<00:04:44.060> at<00:04:44.690> me<00:04:44.900> especially<00:04:45.410> like

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
just by looking at me especially like

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.760 
just by looking at me especially like
here<00:04:46.250> up<00:04:46.520> there<00:04:47.060> light<00:04:47.330> here<00:04:47.690> up<00:04:47.930> which<00:04:48.500> most

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
here up there light here up which most

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.830 
here up there light here up which most
of<00:04:48.860> my<00:04:48.949> videos<00:04:49.280> are<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:49.880> that's<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.210> kind<00:04:50.780> of

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
of my videos are so that's it kind of

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.980 
of my videos are so that's it kind of
short<00:04:51.050> video<00:04:51.380> but<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.800> think<00:04:52.070> an<00:04:52.160> important<00:04:52.550> one

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
short video but I think an important one

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.350 
short video but I think an important one
there<00:04:53.990> seems<00:04:54.289> to<00:04:54.380> be<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:55.550> kind<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:55.940> obsession

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
there seems to be this kind of obsession

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.140 
there seems to be this kind of obsession
amongst<00:04:57.050> vegans<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.009> raw<00:04:58.190> vegans<00:04:58.610> regarding

amongst vegans and raw vegans regarding

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.390 
amongst vegans and raw vegans regarding
fitness<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.289> don't<00:05:00.349> think<00:05:00.560> it's<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.160> an

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
fitness and I don't think it's it's an

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.240 
fitness and I don't think it's it's an
accurate<00:05:02.169> portrayal<00:05:03.169> of<00:05:03.470> fitness<00:05:03.860> that's<00:05:04.009> the

an<00:05:33.830> athlete<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.789> be<00:05:34.940> fit<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.449> that's<00:05:35.780> the

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
an athlete to be fit and that's the

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.020 
an athlete to be fit and that's the
problem<00:05:36.349> that<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:36.949> think<00:05:37.070> is<00:05:37.340> cropping<00:05:37.580> up<00:05:37.820> a

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
problem that I think is cropping up a

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.760 
problem that I think is cropping up a
lot<00:05:38.360> of<00:05:38.449> people<00:05:38.659> saying<00:05:38.840> oh<00:05:39.050> you<00:05:39.199> don't<00:05:39.470> look

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
lot of people saying oh you don't look

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.860 
lot of people saying oh you don't look
like<00:05:39.919> an<00:05:40.099> athlete<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.490> don't<00:05:40.820> look<00:05:40.970> super

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
like an athlete you don't look super

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.230 
like an athlete you don't look super
super<00:05:42.020> slim<00:05:42.440> so<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:42.919> must<00:05:43.250> not<00:05:43.400> be<00:05:43.550> fit<00:05:43.849> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
super slim so you must not be fit and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.600 
super slim so you must not be fit and
it's<00:05:44.900> simply<00:05:45.229> not<00:05:45.320> true<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:46.070> now<00:05:46.340> for<00:05:46.550> the

it's simply not true and now for the
other<00:05:46.760> things<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.240> said<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.570> was<00:05:47.810> going<00:05:48.020> to
