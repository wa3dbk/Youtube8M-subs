00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.570
 epic minecraft tutorials 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.570
 yes 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 how to make a pool 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.560
 my god what heat does I'm going to die of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.560
 thirst and my god 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.140
 until things like this happen 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.699
 hello I am a right and cultural band for 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.729
 that you enjoy the draft and so that 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:46.190
 miss this has enjoyed the ring 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:48.809
 with a pool not before 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.579
 so step 1 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.229
 build your pool before anything looks 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 a good place to have one of the searches 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.739
 these blue wool materials that will simulate 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 a kind of lejitos that have all 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.850
 the pools then also to simulate 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.729
 the curbstone uses stone slabs and so on 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.539
 you can make a superior pool 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.129
 neither do you need to use these 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.440
 You can also make materials from 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.759
 you can make it from grass or 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.200
 you can make lava although it's not 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.200
 recommendable to bathe in the lava 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.050
 Well the fact is that you can do it 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.760
 the materials you want but that yes 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.590
 you are going to have to finish likewise I have 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.970
 placed 2 - guides the closest to 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.580
 pool center will tell us where you have to 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.570
 dig until 10 of another day I'm guided 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 where should I dig 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.350
 good the case is that fits is the gap 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.030
 the pool how big and how deep 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.530
 you want and ryan is the soil with 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 tiles and yes it was such a thing that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 so now you're going to have to do the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.480
 Pool walls start to finish 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.160
 and remove soil the edges of the 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.720
 pool just two pictures of the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.760
 diaz melons and fill it all with 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 tiles once you have them put in the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.690
 top slabs of stone so that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.720
 look like the curb of the pool so you 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.550
 there will be a very nice pool 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 once you finish placing the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.390
 curbs will be time of step 2 place 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.740
 the lights to place the lamps 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.060
 we will have to make some holes of three 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.350
 pictures of deep in the wall of the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.700
 pool where we will place the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.410
 lamps we will have to place a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.790
 rest wiring so let's dig 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.170
 a sort of underground pazin by 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.000
 under the least guides that we 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.470
 we have to put redstone for 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.870
 that connects just with the gaps that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.460
 as you see we have left before from the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.900
 The interior of the pool does not 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.520
 you need to follow these examples of red 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.080
 tables if you have another network circuit 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.400
 they compose it but if you do not know how to do it 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.810
 this is a good help though 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.490
 you can simply put stone and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.620
 luminous instead of rest lamps nor 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.750
 save you all this junk and lujÃ¡n 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 it bursts both scientists that I bring myself 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.890
 here he does hard and with his goodness guys yo 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.600
 Redstone did not put lamps in my 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.400
 pool and works is all full of 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.930
 zombies 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.760
 good and this is the finished circuit 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.170
 placed network repeaters are so that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.880
 keep energy and lamps to the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.290
 two sides of the pool very well only you 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.760
 Fill the gaps with earth 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.959
 she has your lamps now you can 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.520
 keep clippers and others 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.760
 undesirable creatures away from you 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.760
 swimming pool 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.180
 but expect it to be right by the pool 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.000
 while the little one recovers let's go 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.000
 with the step back fill your pool 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.240
 to become a marine animal of 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.240
 Minecraft 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.950
 good and you have your pool I hope 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.480
 that you like when the world is going sir 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.880
 chicken tell me what do you want is that is the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.190
 very boring pool and I wanted to do 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.380
 something with some slides some trampolines 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.100
 to make it more fun and I wanted you 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.470
 will help me but if I throw a pool 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.930
 super fun look here is that it is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.980
 that this is a cauldron and you have just 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.650
 set fire low you want to cook me 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.299
 and chicken will be taught but why 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.020
 foolishness that is not a cauldron there is no 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.150
 fire no 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.860
 it is possible to approach not I do not know why 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.600
 will be gone Mr. Paul I just 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.490
 I wanted to cook, try to give you a 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.530
 The case is that he is right 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.510
 we should put something in the pool like this 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.490
 that I'm going to add an extra step step 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.960
 extra trampolines and other slides 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.580
 things to do the trampoline 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.260
 you will need stone and wood slabs 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.730
 place the stone slabs forming a 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.560
 staircase only that in the last step 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.360
 Place the wooden slab and elongated 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.709
 make the trampoline do it along 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.390
 want but with three frames of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.260
 length will be great you can also 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.180
 make one like in the movies 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.530
 Americans simply by placing a 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.000
 stone slab tower and rag 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.440
 being high you will have a trampoline and the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.360
 higher but do not forget to put 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.560
 those that will be there will never get up for 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.820
 do the dan bait will be a little more 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.410
 complicated you will have to make a 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.940
 three- part staircase the part 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.260
 central will be a box lower than the 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.970
 from the sides to prevent the water from 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.500
 go because that is going to be where 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.030
 will be the slide and where will the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.530
 water when you reach the desired height 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.360
 you will have to do a smooth part already and 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.800
 place a bucket of water already has this 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.210
 slide made simply place a few 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.210
 stairs to upload 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.540
 good and once done our will have 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.400
 to decorate our pool a little 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.320
 digging grooves in the sun and placing 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.900
 wool we can make some towels too 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.880
 we can make sunbeds and a slab of 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.200
 wood and finally awnings with some 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.420
 fences and some wooden slabs for 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.250
 protect you from the sun and so we have the 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.460
 Pool ready and with everything you need 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.260
 well he recovers from his injuries 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.570
 let's see how it is finally how are you 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.910
 well I I'm fine and I'll leave 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.860
 hospital and it 's the shy little black 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.000
 it seems that the zombies seem to have 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.060
 found the little time in the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.060
 hospital 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.189
 good good since our 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.189
 epic tutorial
