00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.849 
them inside the loop then I will pull
now<00:03:56.720> depending<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:57.810> where<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.109> put<00:03:58.319> them<00:03:58.560> on

now depending on where you put them on
your<00:03:59.069> pliers<00:03:59.400> will<00:03:59.729> depend<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.329> size<00:04:00.509> of

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
your pliers will depend on the size of

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.289 
your pliers will depend on the size of
lip<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.139> get<00:04:01.319> but<00:04:02.159> it's<00:04:02.370> good<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.819> put<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
lip you get but it's good to put the

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.679 
lip you get but it's good to put the
bead<00:04:03.569> or<00:04:03.900> your<00:04:04.229> pliers<00:04:04.919> into<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.669> loop<00:04:05.939> so

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
bead or your pliers into that loop so

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.259 
bead or your pliers into that loop so
that<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.139> get<00:04:07.349> a<00:04:07.409> good<00:04:07.739> consistent<00:04:08.729> loop

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
that you get a good consistent loop

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.689 
that you get a good consistent loop
there<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:10.859> once<00:04:11.040> I've<00:04:11.189> got<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.519> size

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
there and then once I've got the size

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.369 
there and then once I've got the size
loop<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.150> won't<00:04:12.389> I'll<00:04:12.569> just<00:04:12.810> take<00:04:13.019> my<00:04:13.049> flat
