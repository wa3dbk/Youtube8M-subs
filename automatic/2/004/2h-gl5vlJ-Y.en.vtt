here<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.970> mean<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.300> guy's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
here which I like I mean this guy's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750 
here which I like I mean this guy's
turned<00:02:31.080> out<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> pretty<00:02:32.070> cool<00:02:32.190> figure<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
turned out to be a pretty cool figure I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.680 
turned out to be a pretty cool figure I
must<00:02:33.270> say<00:02:34.790> um<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.970> thought<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.210> was<00:02:36.360> gonna<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
must say um I thought it was gonna be a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.040 
must say um I thought it was gonna be a
zombie<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.350> something<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.850> don't<00:02:39.300> doesn't

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
zombie or something but I don't doesn't

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.520 
zombie or something but I don't doesn't
really<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.410> looks<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> zombie<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.140> that's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
really it looks like a zombie so that's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.420 
really it looks like a zombie so that's
that's<00:02:44.130> some<00:02:44.900> kind<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.990> half<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.800> Gunnar<00:02:47.130> I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that's some kind of half of Gunnar I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.060 
that's some kind of half of Gunnar I
guess<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:50.330> there's<00:02:51.330> not<00:02:51.420> much<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.780> say<00:02:52.070> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
guess but there's not much to say the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.250 
guess but there's not much to say the
face<00:02:53.490> sculpt<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.540> doesn't<00:02:54.840> really<00:02:54.960> look<00:02:55.200> like

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
face sculpt it doesn't really look like

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.120 
face sculpt it doesn't really look like
