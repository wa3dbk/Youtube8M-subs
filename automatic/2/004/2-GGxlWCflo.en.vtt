very few and in terms of severity the
five<00:00:23.270> things<00:00:23.540> that<00:00:23.810> I<00:00:23.930> worry<00:00:24.470> about<00:00:24.740> with<00:00:24.860> any

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
five things that I worry about with any

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.640 
five things that I worry about with any
surgery<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:25.939> I<00:00:26.150> do<00:00:26.270> basically<00:00:27.110> nice<00:00:27.349> other

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
surgery that I do basically nice other

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.940 
surgery that I do basically nice other
surgeon<00:00:28.099> would<00:00:28.669> say<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:28.970> same<00:00:29.180> thing<00:00:29.450> or

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
surgeon would say the same thing or

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.260 
surgeon would say the same thing or

asymmetry and nerve damage those are the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.780 
asymmetry and nerve damage those are the
five<00:00:34.970> things<00:00:35.030> that<00:00:35.630> we<00:00:35.860> tell<00:00:36.860> people<00:00:37.220> are

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
five things that we tell people are

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.780 
five things that we tell people are
universal<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.780> surgery<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.790> abnormal

scarring<00:00:41.000> after<00:00:41.329> infection<00:00:41.720> after<00:00:42.110> a

scarring after infection after a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.470 
scarring after infection after a
rhinoplasty<00:00:42.650> kin<00:00:43.220> can<00:00:43.700> happen<00:00:44.150> but<00:00:44.330> it's

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
rhinoplasty kin can happen but it's

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.670 
rhinoplasty kin can happen but it's
extremely<00:00:45.080> unusual<00:00:46.360> it's<00:00:47.470> certainly<00:00:48.470> not

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
extremely unusual it's certainly not

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.640 
extremely unusual it's certainly not
something<00:00:48.740> that<00:00:49.400> would<00:00:49.550> be<00:00:49.700> visible<00:00:50.650> because

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
something that would be visible because

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.940 
something that would be visible because
the<00:00:51.950> incisions<00:00:52.460> are<00:00:52.730> not<00:00:52.910> visible<00:00:53.740> so<00:00:54.740> that's

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
the incisions are not visible so that's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.430 
the incisions are not visible so that's
not<00:00:55.160> an<00:00:55.730> issue<00:00:55.880> that<00:00:56.090> I've<00:00:56.390> actually<00:00:56.750> ever<00:00:57.140> had

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
not an issue that I've actually ever had

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.280 
not an issue that I've actually ever had
to<00:00:57.620> deal<00:00:57.800> with<00:00:57.830> directly<00:00:59.110> infection<00:01:00.110> I've

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
to deal with directly infection I've

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.550 
to deal with directly infection I've
seen<00:01:00.680> in<00:01:00.920> over<00:01:01.040> 25<00:01:01.610> years<00:01:01.880> I<00:01:02.390> think<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:03.050> recall

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
seen in over 25 years I think I recall

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.300 
seen in over 25 years I think I recall
one<00:01:04.750> maybe<00:01:05.750> there's<00:01:06.409> maybe<00:01:06.799> there's<00:01:07.040> one<00:01:07.159> I've

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
one maybe there's maybe there's one I've

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.969 
one maybe there's maybe there's one I've
forgotten<00:01:07.610> about<00:01:07.880> but<00:01:08.380> with<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.530> thousands

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
forgotten about but with the thousands

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.950 
forgotten about but with the thousands
I've<00:01:10.130> done<00:01:10.310> over<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.640> years<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:11.210> obviously

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
I've done over the years and obviously

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.730 
I've done over the years and obviously
that's<00:01:12.229> pretty<00:01:12.560> rare<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.810> that's<00:01:14.810> because<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
that's pretty rare so that's because the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.910 
that's pretty rare so that's because the
mid-face<00:01:16.659> especially<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.290> face<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.620> general

mid-face especially the face in general

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.740 
mid-face especially the face in general

rare<00:01:27.159> bleeding<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.760> is<00:01:29.240> something<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.080> can

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
rare bleeding the is something that can

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.310 
rare bleeding the is something that can
occur<00:01:30.590> after<00:01:30.800> any<00:01:31.100> surgery<00:01:31.750> I've<00:01:32.750> only<00:01:32.990> had

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320

rare everybody has a little bleeding
after<00:01:48.770> surgery<00:01:49.360> abnormal<00:01:50.360> bleeding<00:01:50.540> is<00:01:50.870> that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
after surgery abnormal bleeding is that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.930 
after surgery abnormal bleeding is that
when<00:01:51.409> they<00:01:51.590> start<00:01:52.010> bleeding<00:01:52.250> profusely<00:01:52.490> with

fortunately<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.780> my<00:03:21.810> practice<00:03:22.140> my<00:03:22.710> revision

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160

fortunately in my practice my revision
rates<00:03:23.370> only<00:03:23.550> about<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.180> three<00:03:24.210> percent

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.490 
rates only about two to three percent
which<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.610> not<00:03:27.300> because<00:03:27.630> I'm<00:03:27.780> Michelangelo

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
which is not because I'm Michelangelo

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.620 
which is not because I'm Michelangelo
but<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:30.470> just<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:32.040> due<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.820> fact<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.300> I've

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
but it just is due to the fact that I've

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.830 
but it just is due to the fact that I've
been<00:03:33.780> doing<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.080> 25<00:03:34.650> years<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.840> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
been doing this 25 years and I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.650 
been doing this 25 years and I
specialize<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.280> area<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.850> my<00:03:39.300> numbers

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
specialize in this area so I my numbers

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.240 
specialize in this area so I my numbers
and<00:03:39.930> experience<00:03:40.350> are<00:03:40.530> far<00:03:40.709> greater<00:03:40.739> than<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
and experience are far greater than the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.600
