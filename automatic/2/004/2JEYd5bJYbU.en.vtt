00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
to be similar to transit it's not going

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
to be similar to transit it's not going
to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.450> giant<00:01:18.810> map<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.560> different

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
to be one giant map with different

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
to be one giant map with different
locations<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
locations to it it's just going to be a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
locations to it it's just going to be a
very<00:01:22.229> large<00:01:22.920> survival<00:01:23.820> map<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.600> were

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
very large survival map like we were

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.620 
very large survival map like we were
used<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.170> black<00:01:25.740> ops<00:01:26.009> 1<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.549> world<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.450> war

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
used to in black ops 1 and world at war

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
used to in black ops 1 and world at war
so<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.130> similar<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> like

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so it's going to be similar to like

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
so it's going to be similar to like
ascension<00:01:30.030> moon<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> stuff<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
ascension moon and stuff like that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
ascension moon and stuff like that
because<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.619> mean<00:01:31.950> we're<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> city

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
because I mean we're going to a city

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.390 
because I mean we're going to a city
setting<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> means<00:01:34.500> maybe<00:01:35.070> like

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
setting so that kind of means maybe like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.380 
setting so that kind of means maybe like
you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.610> gigantic<00:01:36.420> buildings<00:01:36.900> helicopters

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390

that<00:02:32.129> went<00:02:32.430> off<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.879> maybe<00:02:33.180> even<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.540> nuke<00:02:33.750> went

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
