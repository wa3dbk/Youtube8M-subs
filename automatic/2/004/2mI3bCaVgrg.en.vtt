00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.940
 hello everyone I'm not using 21 and here you 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.430
 I bring the 4th the fourth chapter of the 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.030
 Story mode of the game Naruto Ultimate 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.030
 ninja storm 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 let's see what mission we have today 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.170
 and um 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.910
 i 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.910
 then with far that you see 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.530
 the mission is more or less easy 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 improvise and 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 the mission or just to move forward by 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.960
 the forest of the leaf without you from the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.960
 trees so more or less easy 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.260
 ok we started the time 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.530
 in this vision what you have to have in 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 account is to be lucky because 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.520
 depending on how many 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 how many 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.770
 the speed games choose so much more 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.040
 easy to overcome the mission in the limit of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.290
 time they ask you enough 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.030
 as you can see now it has enough 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.650
 lucky they have four a lot of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.650
 objects to maintain speed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.840
 and there are only two kilometers left to see 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.390
 now if you have not caught it but good another 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.200
 time 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.200
 lets go 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.370
 I want to know 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.150
 there's nothing left 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 has finished 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.819
 I got what they asked me in the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.060
 mission and also the conditions of 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.060
 stress 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.550
 good conditions to be a little 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.910
 complicated but in this way what 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.910
 agreed 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.010
