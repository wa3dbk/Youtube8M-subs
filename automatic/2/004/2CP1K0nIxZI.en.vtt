00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:27.796
What's like your course at Hofmann's School?

00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:29.807
I’ve enjoyed it a lot

00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:31.623
firstly, a great atmosphere

00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:34.520
secondly, the cooking is fabulous

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.041
And thirdly, when you travel
and teach like this,

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.293
people is what really interests me,

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.454
you get to know both
interesting and interested people

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.927
with whom you can share things

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:55.424
the school,
Mey Hofmann’s hospitality

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:59.178
it’s all of this what makes you say

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:01.616
‘it’s been worth coming’

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:03.263
it’s a real pleasure

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:12.282
Winning the Pastry World Cup changed your life?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.714
A turning point?
Not at all

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:17.456
I trained conscientiously
because I wanted to win the Cup

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:19.661
It had been my dream since
I was a child

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.924
I remember the day I won

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.888
when I was given the trophy

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.437
at that very moment,
I started wondering

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:27.440
‘what should I do from tomorrow on?’

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.067
‘This goal has been accomplished, so

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:31.593
what will my new goal be?’

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:33.792
I’m not a person living in the past

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.528
I try to evolve continuously

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:41.468
What's your indispensable ingredient?

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:44.546
Chocolate

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:46.301
to be quite honest

00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:47.853
because I love it

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:49.314
in all its shapes

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:51.695
especially milk chocolate
rather than dark chocolate

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.510
What's your professional philosophy about?

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.715
It’s simple,
as I just said

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:05.917
I live in the present

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.679
my decision always was to create a trend
rather than to follow one

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:13.907
In my opinion, tomorrow’s pastry

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.433
should resemble anything

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.210
except what is done today

00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:19.164
So I’m thinking about it…

00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:20.741
Tomorrow’s pastry

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:23.187
will be ‘street food’-type

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:24.969
fresh pastry,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.560
non-frozen

00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:28.990
with no chocolate garnishes

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.921
which are useless,
they’re removed when slicing the cake

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:34.596
I feel like sticking to the essence

00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:37.792
And I know that right now
I can dare do it

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:45.474
How will the pastry of the future be?

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:48.558
I think the pastry of the future

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.503
will be a less fatty pastry

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.068
less sweet

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.271
and a bit more
‘appealing to the others’

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:57.221
that is, gluten free,
lactose free

00:02:57.682 --> 00:03:00.178
for diabetic or allergic people…

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.004
And I’m being very honest

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:08.018
tomorrow’s pastry
will be made daily

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.080
with no freezing,
because flavor loses its nature

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.581
and it becomes too gelled,

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:16.643
then additives are added,
chocolate garnishes…

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.770
Tomorrow’s pastry
will be displayed on the counter

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:22.832
made and then served

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:32.679
Does french pastry remain as the best of the world?

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:38.935
I don’t know, it may be
because it’s typically French

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:42.063
there may not be a lot of pastries

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:45.062
which can boast about having

00:03:45.563 --> 00:03:48.264
50 regional specialties

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:51.520
perhaps because it’s
a long-standing thing here

00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:53.121
Long ago

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:56.587
the French cuisine was at the very top

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:59.065
but we have been reached,
overtaken by the Spanish

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.366
by the Italians

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:05.193
by fabulous chefs from
Norway, Sweden…

00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:09.390
The hallmark, I think
there’s only one real pastry

00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:12.802
the traditional and
really authentic one

00:04:12.903 --> 00:04:15.194
The origins remain in France

00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:18.058
although there are amazing things
somewhere else

00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:27.208
Professional level in France keeps on the top

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.950
In fact, a lot of things are moving
in Paris

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:31.851
Pastry had never been so

00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:35.319
full steam ahead, so to speak

00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:40.677
there has been an increasing participation
of chefs in the media since 2000

00:04:40.778 --> 00:04:42.449
that has reached pastry

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.857
and the proof is that, in France,

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.906
I’m going to take part
in a daily TV program myself

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.324
from September on, about cooking,

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:55.789
pastry, both sweet and savory

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.356
Pastry nowadays

00:04:58.457 --> 00:05:02.744
this is what you have to do
to be up to date

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:13.353
What about your future?

00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:20.063
My future?
Many things

00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:22.072
Opening my own school

00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:23.877
in Paris this autumn

00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.860
A great collaboration project
with Alain Ducasse

00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:29.363
about a sweet concept

00:05:29.464 --> 00:05:31.418
and the daily program coming soon

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.690
on the French television
