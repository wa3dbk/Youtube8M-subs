hi I'm Stephen the pen man from Big
Apple<00:00:02.639> pet<00:00:02.790> supply<00:00:03.179> I'm<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.290> show<00:00:04.470> you

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
Apple pet supply I'm going to show you

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.280 
Apple pet supply I'm going to show you
how<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.920> Big<00:00:05.310> Apple<00:00:05.759> misting<00:00:06.180> system<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.899> very

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
how the Big Apple misting system is very

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.270 
how the Big Apple misting system is very
easy<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.770> use<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.400> how<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.870> perfect<00:00:10.650> for

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
easy to use and how it's perfect for

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.450 
easy to use and how it's perfect for
creating<00:00:11.969> humidity<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.990> reptile<00:00:13.860> enclosures

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
creating humidity in reptile enclosures

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.240 
creating humidity in reptile enclosures
that<00:00:14.670> need<00:00:15.389> humidity<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.289> tropical<00:00:16.980> species

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
that need humidity so tropical species

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.759 
that need humidity so tropical species
but<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.119> also<00:00:18.330> great<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:19.070> plants<00:00:20.119> flowers

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
but it's also great for plants flowers

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.380 
but it's also great for plants flowers
pretty<00:00:22.769> much<00:00:23.100> anything<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.789> requires

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
pretty much anything that requires

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.099 
pretty much anything that requires
humidity<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> misting<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.480> it's<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> lot

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
humidity and misting so it's got a lot

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
humidity and misting so it's got a lot
of<00:00:28.170> versatility<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.910> let's<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.269> ahead

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
of versatility to it so let's go ahead

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.459 
of versatility to it so let's go ahead
and<00:00:30.630> open<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> check<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.679> out

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
and open it up and check it out

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.270 
and open it up and check it out
first<00:00:34.469> thing<00:00:34.620> you're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.100> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
first thing you're going to see is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.060 
first thing you're going to see is
always<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.969> instructions<00:00:36.870> which<00:00:37.530> basically

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
always your instructions which basically

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.639 
always your instructions which basically
detail<00:00:38.640> how<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.390> together<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.410> I'm

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
detail how to put it together but I'm

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.060 
detail how to put it together but I'm
going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> show<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.910> done

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
going to show you how this is done

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.380 
going to show you how this is done
basically<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> come<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
basically it's going to come with a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.040 
basically it's going to come with a
timer<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> digital<00:00:46.940> 7-day<00:00:47.940> timer<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
timer and digital 7-day timer which is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
timer and digital 7-day timer which is
programmable<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> minute<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.850> can

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
programmable to the minute and you can

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.290 
programmable to the minute and you can
have<00:00:51.180> multiple<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.989> offs<00:00:52.440> per<00:00:52.890> day<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.850> let's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
have multiple on offs per day so let's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
have multiple on offs per day so let's
say<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> start<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.390> misting

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
say if you want to start the misting

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
say if you want to start the misting
system<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.379> 9<00:00:59.070> a.m.<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
system going at 9 a.m. and you want it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.299 
system going at 9 a.m. and you want it
to<00:01:00.809> go<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.199> two<00:01:01.320> minutes<00:01:01.649> you'll<00:01:01.800> set<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.039> for

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to go for two minutes you'll set it for

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.899 
to go for two minutes you'll set it for
9<00:01:02.489> a.m.<00:01:02.629> then<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:03.870> 9:02<00:01:04.589> a.m.<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
9 a.m. then at 9:02 a.m. you're going to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.050 
9 a.m. then at 9:02 a.m. you're going to
have<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> shut<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.960> maybe<00:01:07.470> 2<00:01:08.430> p.m.<00:01:08.790> you're

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
have it shut off and maybe 2 p.m. you're

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460 
have it shut off and maybe 2 p.m. you're
gonna<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> come<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.659> again<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.080> another

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
gonna have a come on again for another

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.440 
gonna have a come on again for another
couple<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> minutes<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.520> maybe<00:01:12.119> you'll<00:01:12.299> do

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
couple of minutes and maybe you'll do

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
couple of minutes and maybe you'll do
that<00:01:12.630> several<00:01:13.560> times<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.010> day

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that several times a day

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
that several times a day
we<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> tell<00:01:15.750> people<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:17.070> like

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
we what I tell people to do is do like

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.570 
we what I tell people to do is do like
four<00:01:17.670> misting<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.380> minute<00:01:19.619> misting

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
four misting like one minute misting

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
four misting like one minute misting
sessions<00:01:21.090> per<00:01:21.630> day<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> check<00:01:22.920> out

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sessions per day just to check out

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
sessions per day just to check out
that's<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> minimum<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that's kind of the minimum and just to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510 
that's kind of the minimum and just to
check<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.380> how<00:01:25.680> much<00:01:25.830> humidity<00:01:26.189> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
check out how much humidity that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
check out how much humidity that
produces<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> drench<00:01:28.439> your

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
produces you don't want to drench your

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.630 
produces you don't want to drench your
cage<00:01:28.799> okay

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
cage okay

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.319 
cage okay
let's<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> rest<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> goodies

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
let's take out the rest of the goodies

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.539 
let's take out the rest of the goodies
so<00:01:33.329> basically<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.920> 2<00:01:35.130> gallon

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
so basically this is your 2 gallon

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.289 
so basically this is your 2 gallon
reservoir<00:01:35.930> which<00:01:37.460> obviously<00:01:38.460> holds<00:01:39.000> 2

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
reservoir which obviously holds 2

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
reservoir which obviously holds 2
gallons<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> water<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.759> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
gallons of water and this is what I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.480 
gallons of water and this is what I
recommend<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.259> only<00:01:43.829> use

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
recommend that you do is only use

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
recommend that you do is only use
distilled<00:01:45.060> water<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> reason<00:01:46.320> why<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
distilled water and the reason why I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.980 
distilled water and the reason why I
recommend<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:48.149> most<00:01:48.420> people's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
recommend that is because most people's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370 
recommend that is because most people's
regular<00:01:49.439> water<00:01:49.820> contains<00:01:50.820> components<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
regular water contains components in it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
regular water contains components in it
like<00:01:52.530> calcium<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.850> types<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.450> things

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
like calcium and other types of things

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
like calcium and other types of things
that<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.649> end<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.130> clogging<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.149> fine

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that will end up clogging the fine

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.620 
that will end up clogging the fine
misting<00:01:58.320> nozzles<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
misting nozzles on the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
misting nozzles on the
so<00:02:00.400> we<00:02:01.400> don't<00:02:01.610> want<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.240> clog<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.750> nozzles<00:02:03.259> or

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
so we don't want to clog the nozzles or

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.690 
so we don't want to clog the nozzles or
your<00:02:04.009> system<00:02:04.369> won't<00:02:04.549> run<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.530> fine<00:02:07.310> mist

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
your system won't run with the fine mist

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.050 
your system won't run with the fine mist
that<00:02:08.149> it's<00:02:08.330> supposed<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.840> run<00:02:09.050> with<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> use

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
that it's supposed to run with so use

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
that it's supposed to run with so use
distilled<00:02:11.480> water<00:02:11.750> now<00:02:13.150> basically<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:15.319> system

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
distilled water now basically the system

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.390 
distilled water now basically the system
comes<00:02:16.010> with<00:02:16.160> ten<00:02:17.060> feet<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.720> hose<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:19.040> goes

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
comes with ten feet of hose this goes

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.690 
comes with ten feet of hose this goes
out<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.060> your<00:02:20.209> cage<00:02:20.600> or<00:02:20.900> cages<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:22.250> be<00:02:22.400> cut

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
out to your cage or cages it can be cut

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.300 
out to your cage or cages it can be cut
into<00:02:22.940> multiples<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.319> let's<00:02:24.620> say<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.100> you

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
into multiples so let's say that you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.820 
into multiples so let's say that you
have<00:02:26.470> ten<00:02:27.470> or<00:02:28.000> let's<00:02:29.000> say<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.420> have<00:02:29.830> 20

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
have ten or let's say that you have 20

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.390 
have ten or let's say that you have 20
gallon<00:02:31.220> aquariums<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:33.100> five<00:02:34.100> them

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
gallon aquariums and you have five them

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.600 
gallon aquariums and you have five them
well<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.360> take<00:02:35.569> this<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.220> let's<00:02:37.220> say

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
well you can take this and let's say

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.520 
well you can take this and let's say
that<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.940> have<00:02:38.180> an<00:02:38.510> aquarium<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.140> recording

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
that you have an aquarium here recording

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.860 
that you have an aquarium here recording
in<00:02:39.739> there<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.340> can<00:02:40.519> actually<00:02:40.700> continue<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
in there you can actually continue to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.090 
in there you can actually continue to
mist

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
mist

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.870 
mist
each<00:02:43.489> one<00:02:43.910> as<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.180> go<00:02:44.690> with<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.680> going<00:02:46.670> into

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
each one as you go with the going into

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.180 
each one as you go with the going into
each<00:02:47.060> aquarium<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.769> be<00:02:48.800> used<00:02:48.890> for

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
each aquarium so this can be used for

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.080 
each aquarium so this can be used for
multiple<00:02:49.600> multiple<00:02:50.600> aquariums<00:02:51.380> now<00:02:52.069> as<00:02:52.700> far

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
multiple multiple aquariums now as far

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.059 
multiple multiple aquariums now as far
as<00:02:53.239> getting<00:02:53.830> water<00:02:54.830> into<00:02:56.769> basically<00:02:57.769> this

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
as getting water into basically this

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.460 
as getting water into basically this
bucket<00:02:58.519> once<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.180> put<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.510> water<00:02:59.720> in<00:03:00.019> all

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
bucket once you put the water in all

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.160 
bucket once you put the water in all
you're<00:03:00.980> going<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.370> do<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:01.880> sink<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.600> hose<00:03:02.870> in

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
you're going to do is sink this hose in

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.009 
you're going to do is sink this hose in
now<00:03:03.890> what's<00:03:04.160> really<00:03:04.519> really<00:03:05.060> important<00:03:05.900> is

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
now what's really really important is

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.819 
now what's really really important is
that<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.890> don't<00:03:07.250> allow<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.480> tube<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.170> slip

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
that you don't allow this tube to slip

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.539 
that you don't allow this tube to slip
up<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.120> don't<00:03:11.510> want<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.049> tube<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.739> come

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
up so you don't want this tube to come

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.060 
up so you don't want this tube to come
and<00:03:13.880> curl<00:03:14.209> up<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.930> because<00:03:15.560> what's<00:03:15.829> going

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and curl up on you because what's going

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.680 
and curl up on you because what's going
to<00:03:16.100> happen<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.609> you're<00:03:16.790> gonna<00:03:16.940> run<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.390> pump

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
to happen is you're gonna run this pump

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.050 
to happen is you're gonna run this pump
and<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.290> pumps<00:03:18.620> gonna<00:03:18.739> run<00:03:19.010> dry<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.700> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
and the pumps gonna run dry and that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.000 
and the pumps gonna run dry and that
converted<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.600> pump<00:03:20.840> out<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.470> must<00:03:21.890> make

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
converted the pump out so you must make

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.240 
converted the pump out so you must make
sure<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.060> secure<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.650> bottom

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
sure that you secure this to the bottom

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.370 
sure that you secure this to the bottom
of<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.880> pail<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.750> can<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.200> either

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
of the pail and you can do that either

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.229 
of the pail and you can do that either
by<00:03:27.530> weighing<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.130> down<00:03:28.160> with<00:03:28.489> weights<00:03:28.790> or<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
by weighing it down with weights or you

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.920 
by weighing it down with weights or you
can<00:03:30.109> do<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.440> by<00:03:30.650> using<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.640> tape<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.510> is

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
can do that by using a tape that is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.220 
can do that by using a tape that is
waterproof<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.280> whatever<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:35.359> make<00:03:36.079> sure

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
waterproof so whatever it is make sure

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.680 
waterproof so whatever it is make sure
you<00:03:36.350> stick<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.769> down<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.400> stays<00:03:37.730> down<00:03:38.090> okay

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
you stick it down and it stays down okay

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.960 
you stick it down and it stays down okay
you<00:03:38.720> don't<00:03:39.019> want<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.470> curl<00:03:39.739> them<00:03:39.920> once<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:40.820> do

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
you don't want to curl them once you do

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.390 
you don't want to curl them once you do
that<00:03:41.140> you're<00:03:42.140> basically<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.680> setting<00:03:43.250> this

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
that you're basically just setting this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.470 
that you're basically just setting this
on<00:03:43.640> top<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:45.200> like<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.940> you're<00:03:46.940> gonna<00:03:47.060> plug

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
on top just like that you're gonna plug

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.069 
on top just like that you're gonna plug
this<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.680> bottom<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.250> your<00:03:49.310> timer<00:03:49.700> and

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
this in to the bottom of your timer and

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.930 
this in to the bottom of your timer and
your<00:03:51.079> timer<00:03:51.350> goes<00:03:51.620> into<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.950> wall<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:52.640> whatever

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
your timer goes into a wall so whatever

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.960 
your timer goes into a wall so whatever
settings<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.570> have<00:03:53.959> on<00:03:54.320> here<00:03:54.620> are<00:03:55.040> going<00:03:55.850> to

settings you have on here are going to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.759 
settings you have on here are going to
control<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.600> pump<00:03:56.840> which<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.560> going<00:03:57.709> to

customers<00:04:17.060> who<00:04:17.180> have<00:04:17.269> done<00:04:17.480> stuff<00:04:17.780> like<00:04:17.989> that

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
customers who have done stuff like that

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.290 
customers who have done stuff like that
and<00:04:18.320> obviously<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:19.400> know<00:04:19.430> you're<00:04:19.700> talking<00:04:19.820> 12

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
and obviously you know you're talking 12

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.720 
and obviously you know you're talking 12
hours<00:04:20.660> on<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.920> definitely<00:04:22.160> don't<00:04:22.460> want<00:04:22.670> to

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
hours on so you definitely don't want to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.370 
hours on so you definitely don't want to
do<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:22.970> really<00:04:23.420> double<00:04:23.990> check<00:04:24.230> your

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
do that really double check your

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.140 
do that really double check your
settings<00:04:24.620> when<00:04:24.890> you<00:04:25.040> program<00:04:25.310> your<00:04:25.760> timer

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
settings when you program your timer

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.570 
settings when you program your timer
they<00:04:26.840> should<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.140> no<00:04:27.530> more<00:04:27.560> than<00:04:27.860> four<00:04:28.220> minutes

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
they should be no more than four minutes

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.690 
they should be no more than four minutes
because<00:04:28.850> this<00:04:29.480> timer<00:04:29.870> this<00:04:30.350> pump<00:04:30.620> cannot<00:04:31.250> go

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
because this timer this pump cannot go

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.840 
because this timer this pump cannot go
longer<00:04:32.300> than<00:04:32.660> four<00:04:33.140> minutes<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.670> will

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
longer than four minutes so it will

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.760 
longer than four minutes so it will
start<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.210> get<00:04:35.330> very<00:04:35.390> hot<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.110> can<00:04:36.560> eventually

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
start to get very hot and can eventually

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.640 
start to get very hot and can eventually
burn<00:04:37.250> out<00:04:37.430> or<00:04:37.670> cause<00:04:37.880> other<00:04:38.090> problems<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:39.080> four

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
burn out or cause other problems so four

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.950 
burn out or cause other problems so four
minute<00:04:39.920> maximum<00:04:40.340> on<00:04:40.700> this<00:04:41.090> pump<00:04:41.390> but<00:04:41.870> you

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
minute maximum on this pump but you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.690 
minute maximum on this pump but you
should<00:04:42.140> never<00:04:42.260> be<00:04:42.530> using<00:04:42.950> more<00:04:43.220> than<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.460> four

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
should never be using more than the four

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.280 
should never be using more than the four
minute<00:04:43.970> misting<00:04:44.300> session<00:04:44.720> because<00:04:45.020> that's<00:04:45.200> a

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
minute misting session because that's a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.890 
minute misting session because that's a
tremendous<00:04:45.950> amount<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.280> water<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:47.210> basically

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
tremendous amount of water so basically

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.100 
tremendous amount of water so basically
on<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.200> other<00:04:48.350> side<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.820> where<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.960> are

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
on the other side this is where you are

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.290 
on the other side this is where you are
going<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:52.100> would<00:04:52.220> obviously<00:04:52.490> be<00:04:52.700> undoing

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
going to you would obviously be undoing

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.930 
going to you would obviously be undoing
this<00:04:53.450> cord<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:54.080> ten<00:04:54.530> feet<00:04:54.560> long<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:55.670> show

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
this cord it's ten feet long but to show

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.020 
this cord it's ten feet long but to show
you<00:04:56.000> how<00:04:56.210> simple<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:57.010> basically<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
you how simple this is basically the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.120 
you how simple this is basically the
last<00:05:00.220> misting<00:05:01.690> nozzle<00:05:02.690> would<00:05:03.080> be<00:05:03.260> an<00:05:03.380> elbow<00:05:03.890> if

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
last misting nozzle would be an elbow if

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.580 
last misting nozzle would be an elbow if
you<00:05:04.610> were<00:05:04.790> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.210> like<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.900> talked<00:05:06.290> about

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
you were going to like I talked about

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.340 
you were going to like I talked about
going<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.580> multiples<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.390> would<00:05:08.780> be<00:05:08.900> sticking

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
going to multiples you would be sticking

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.220 
going to multiples you would be sticking
this<00:05:09.830> on<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.400> here<00:05:10.670> and<00:05:11.330> sliding<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.960> all<00:05:12.140> the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
this on to here and sliding it all the

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.950 
this on to here and sliding it all the
way<00:05:12.350> up<00:05:12.530> then<00:05:13.340> another<00:05:13.820> tube<00:05:14.240> would<00:05:14.510> be<00:05:14.630> coming

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
way up then another tube would be coming

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.830 
way up then another tube would be coming
out<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.260> other<00:05:15.290> side<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:16.010> going<00:05:16.160> to<00:05:16.430> another

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
out the other side and going to another

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.170 
out the other side and going to another
nozzle<00:05:17.840> so<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:18.740> is<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.010> coupler<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.970> all

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
nozzle so this is the coupler and all

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.390 
nozzle so this is the coupler and all
you<00:05:20.330> do<00:05:20.540> is<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:21.380> would<00:05:21.530> tighten<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:22.010> coupler

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
you do is you would tighten the coupler

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.180 
you do is you would tighten the coupler
all<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.970> way<00:05:23.060> up<00:05:24.430> then<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:25.730> nozzle<00:05:27.190> goes

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
all the way up then this nozzle goes

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.850 
all the way up then this nozzle goes
into<00:05:28.580> there<00:05:28.790> and<00:05:29.060> then<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.169> can<00:05:30.440> continue

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
into there and then you can continue

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.540 
into there and then you can continue
another<00:05:31.370> tube<00:05:31.730> out<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:33.260> another<00:05:33.590> cage<00:05:33.890> another

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
another tube out to another cage another

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.540 
another tube out to another cage another
T<00:05:34.880> nozzle<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:35.840> when<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.290> finally<00:05:36.740> are<00:05:37.010> done

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
T nozzle and when you finally are done

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.940 
T nozzle and when you finally are done
and<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.360> want<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.690> end<00:05:38.930> with<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.320> last<00:05:39.470> cave's

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
and you want to end with the last cave's

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.300 
and you want to end with the last cave's
the<00:05:40.460> last<00:05:40.730> cage<00:05:41.210> in<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.690> row<00:05:41.870> would<00:05:42.770> always<00:05:42.950> be

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
the last cage in the row would always be

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.720 
the last cage in the row would always be
an<00:05:43.550> elbow<00:05:44.350> because<00:05:45.350> that<00:05:45.740> ends<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.580> would

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
an elbow because that ends and you would

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.520 
an elbow because that ends and you would
slide<00:05:46.970> it<00:05:47.210> on<00:05:47.330> this<00:05:47.720> in<00:05:47.990> this<00:05:48.110> case<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.440> would

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
slide it on this in this case you would

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.159 
slide it on this in this case you would
slide<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:48.950> all<00:05:49.100> the<00:05:49.430> way<00:05:49.580> in<00:05:49.850> and<00:05:50.120> then<00:05:50.960> you

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
slide it all the way in and then you

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.190 
slide it all the way in and then you
would<00:05:51.380> have<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.820> nozzle<00:05:53.330> come<00:05:53.720> out<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.110> that

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
would have the nozzle come out and that

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.350 
would have the nozzle come out and that
would<00:05:54.350> be<00:05:54.440> your<00:05:54.590> final<00:05:54.970> that<00:05:55.970> would<00:05:56.120> be<00:05:56.240> the

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
would be your final that would be the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.950 
would be your final that would be the
end<00:05:56.710> nozzle<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.220> T's<00:05:58.700> but<00:05:59.480> when<00:05:59.630> you<00:05:59.720> want<00:05:59.900> to

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
end nozzle so T's but when you want to

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.610 
end nozzle so T's but when you want to
continue<00:06:01.030> elbows<00:06:02.030> what<00:06:02.870> you<00:06:02.990> want<00:06:03.200> to<00:06:03.290> stop

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
continue elbows what you want to stop

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.190 
continue elbows what you want to stop
and<00:06:03.950> that's<00:06:04.220> your<00:06:04.400> last<00:06:04.610> nozzle<00:06:05.360> now<00:06:05.990> one

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
and that's your last nozzle now one

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.630 
and that's your last nozzle now one
thing<00:06:06.410> you<00:06:06.530> should<00:06:06.680> know<00:06:06.830> about<00:06:06.980> these<00:06:07.310> fine

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
thing you should know about these fine

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.170 
thing you should know about these fine
red<00:06:08.630> nozzles<00:06:09.590> like<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.550> talked<00:06:10.880> about<00:06:11.000> before

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
red nozzles like I talked about before

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.409 
red nozzles like I talked about before
we<00:06:12.169> use<00:06:12.440> distilled<00:06:12.950> water<00:06:13.250> because<00:06:14.030> we<00:06:14.180> don't

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
we use distilled water because we don't

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.450 
we use distilled water because we don't
want<00:06:14.600> to<00:06:14.660> clog<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:15.080> clog<00:06:15.380> this<00:06:15.590> fine<00:06:15.800> nozzle

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
want to clog the clog this fine nozzle

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.159
