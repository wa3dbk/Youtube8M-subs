00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
Adam unidad walia came up with this idea

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820 
Adam unidad walia came up with this idea
of<00:00:09.389> Dakota<00:00:09.719> won't<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.290> tell<00:00:10.469> us<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.590> little<00:00:10.679> bit

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
of Dakota won't you tell us a little bit

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.759 
of Dakota won't you tell us a little bit
about<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.250> okay<00:00:11.759> well<00:00:12.090> first<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.620> did

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
about it okay well first of all we did

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.860 
about it okay well first of all we did
this<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.130> eight<00:00:14.309> years<00:00:14.460> ago<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:15.599> tried<00:00:15.839> all

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this about eight years ago we tried all

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.960 
this about eight years ago we tried all
kinds<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.379> different<00:00:16.650> girls<00:00:16.800> dan<00:00:17.369> never<00:00:17.730> found

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
kinds of different girls dan never found

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
kinds of different girls dan never found
when<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.210> were<00:00:18.480> happy<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.770> tried<00:00:19.980> all

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
when we were happy with and we tried all

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.359 
when we were happy with and we tried all
kinds<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.460> things<00:00:20.660> charcoal<00:00:21.660> too<00:00:22.170> slow<00:00:22.410> too

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
kinds of things charcoal too slow too

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.200 
kinds of things charcoal too slow too
much<00:00:23.490> effort<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:24.240> gasps<00:00:24.630> dries<00:00:25.320> things<00:00:25.619> out

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
much effort now gasps dries things out

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.580 
much effort now gasps dries things out
try<00:00:27.210> some<00:00:27.390> electric<00:00:27.750> grills<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.230> even<00:00:28.439> had<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
try some electric grills we even had a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.830 
try some electric grills we even had a
jenn<00:00:28.830> air<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> few<00:00:29.279> years<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.910> we

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
jenn air for a few years and we

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.990 
jenn air for a few years and we
eventually<00:00:30.949> we<00:00:31.949> started<00:00:32.130> experimenting<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
eventually we started experimenting and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
eventually we started experimenting and
eventually<00:00:33.420> came<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.290> here

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
eventually came up with this right here

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.150 
eventually came up with this right here
and<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> an<00:00:36.480> electric<00:00:37.230> dakota<00:00:37.620> grill<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and this is an electric dakota grill and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
and this is an electric dakota grill and
the<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.879> works<00:00:39.149> first<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.440> chose

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the way it works first of all we chose

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
the way it works first of all we chose
to<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:40.920> electric<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.180> control<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to go electric so we can control the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.529 
to go electric so we can control the
airflow<00:00:42.870> okay<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.489> key<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.210> make

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
airflow okay and that is key to make

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.529 
airflow okay and that is key to make
really<00:00:46.170> juicy<00:00:46.590> meat<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.390> too

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
really juicy meat so if you have too

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.940 
really juicy meat so if you have too
much<00:00:48.629> air<00:00:48.840> flow<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.469> takes<00:00:49.829> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
much air flow it just takes that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
much air flow it just takes that
moisture<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.610> away<00:00:50.850> takes<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:51.989> off

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
moisture right away takes it right off

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
moisture right away takes it right off
bubble<00:00:52.379> dreiss<00:00:53.250> things<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.730> okay<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.660> with

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
bubble dreiss things out okay now with

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.209 
bubble dreiss things out okay now with
this<00:00:55.020> since<00:00:55.469> we're<00:00:55.649> controlling<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
this since we're controlling that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
this since we're controlling that
airflow<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.660> set<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
airflow and we actually set that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.080 
airflow and we actually set that
specifically<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> meat<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.820> make<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
specifically for the meat to make it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
specifically for the meat to make it
absolutely<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.750> juicy<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.140> possible<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
absolutely as juicy as possible and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640 
absolutely as juicy as possible and
that's<00:01:02.760> steak<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.930> could<00:01:04.080> leave<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.409> steak

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that's steak we could leave that steak

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.399 
that's steak we could leave that steak
on<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.400> an<00:01:05.700> hour<00:01:05.939> after<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.659> done<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
on there for an hour after it's done and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
on there for an hour after it's done and
it<00:01:07.500> still<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> wonderful<00:01:08.159> steak<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.150> can

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it still be a wonderful steak you can

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.789 
it still be a wonderful steak you can
still<00:01:09.450> impress<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> neighbors<00:01:09.990> first<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> all

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
still impress the neighbors first of all

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.710 
still impress the neighbors first of all
the<00:01:10.950> moisture<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.460> course<00:01:11.820> since<00:01:12.600> we're

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the moisture of course since we're

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
the moisture of course since we're
controlling<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.350> airflow<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> moisture

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
controlling that airflow that moisture

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
controlling that airflow that moisture
just<00:01:14.610> stays<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> grill<00:01:15.540> okay<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> very

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
just stays in the grill okay it's a very

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.850 
just stays in the grill okay it's a very
moist<00:01:16.740> heat<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.340> opposed<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> dry<00:01:18.509> heat<00:01:18.860> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
moist heat as opposed to a dry heat the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
moist heat as opposed to a dry heat the
next<00:01:20.130> thing<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.759> we've<00:01:21.360> got

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
next thing that we do we've got

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
next thing that we do we've got
electronic<00:01:22.049> controls<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.920> let<00:01:23.610> me<00:01:23.700> just

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
electronic controls here let me just

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.320 
electronic controls here let me just
turn<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.299> real<00:01:24.509> quick<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.850> tells<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
turn it on real quick and this tells you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
turn it on real quick and this tells you
this<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.810> monitor<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.200> grill<00:01:28.500> temperature

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
this will monitor the grill temperature

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.090 
this will monitor the grill temperature
and<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.030> control<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.689> precisely

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and you can control it very precisely

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730 
and you can control it very precisely
and<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.580> use<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.760> meat<00:01:33.060> probe<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.740> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and if you use the meat probe here that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.240 
and if you use the meat probe here that
will<00:01:34.920> tell<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.960> temperature<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.080> well

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
will tell you your temperature as well

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
will tell you your temperature as well
they<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.400> program<00:01:38.759> abroad<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:39.570> okay

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
they just program abroad on you are okay

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
they just program abroad on you are okay
cool<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.830> that's<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.700> simple<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
cool and that's as simple as that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.320 
cool and that's as simple as that
program<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.619> walk<00:01:43.770> away<00:01:44.210> that's<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
program it you can walk away that's a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.870
