to have to do a wheel I'm using a Tomac
right<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.270> also<00:00:33.540> use<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> semtex<00:00:34.219> it's

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
right now you can also use a semtex it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
really too tricky but it definitely

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040 
really too tricky but it definitely
gives<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> an<00:00:38.760> insane<00:00:39.149> effect<00:00:39.510> where<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> just

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
gives you an insane effect where it just

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
gives you an insane effect where it just
doesn't<00:00:40.469> show<00:00:40.500> any<00:00:40.950> type<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> gun<00:00:41.579> um<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.270> have

really<00:01:17.970> cool<00:01:18.060> thing<00:01:18.420> about<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.840> shot<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really cool thing about this shot is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
really cool thing about this shot is
that<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.560> still<00:01:20.250> shoot<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.729> your

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that you can still shoot out your

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
that you can still shoot out your
comparison<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.810> still<00:01:22.080> kill<00:01:22.290> enemies<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
comparison you can still kill enemies it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
comparison you can still kill enemies it
also<00:01:23.189> shows<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.820> kill<00:01:24.030> cams<00:01:24.299> sometimes<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
also shows in kill cams sometimes it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
also shows in kill cams sometimes it
doesn't<00:01:25.080> sometimes<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
doesn't sometimes it does it's just a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.429 
doesn't sometimes it does it's just a
little<00:01:27.390> tricky<00:01:27.689> thing<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> might<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
little tricky thing you might have to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.990 
little tricky thing you might have to
get<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:28.979> lucky<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.880> if
