00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.180 
movement here and I'll browse lamp food
this<00:03:51.350> time<00:03:51.410> is<00:03:51.739> very<00:03:52.070> bright<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:53.590> no<00:03:54.590> change<00:03:54.980> I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
this time is very bright and no change I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.010 
this time is very bright and no change I
lost<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:56.860> whole

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.390 

so<00:04:01.020> it<00:04:01.230> seems<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.740> ground<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.220> very

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
so it seems that the ground is very

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.600 
so it seems that the ground is very
important<00:04:03.240> there<00:04:05.120> mmm<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:07.220> have<00:04:08.220> made<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.400> lot<00:04:08.580> of

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
important there mmm I have made a lot of

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.640 
important there mmm I have made a lot of
other<00:04:09.000> discoveries<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.690> will<00:04:10.080> probably<00:04:10.350> make

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
other discoveries I will probably make

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.190 
other discoveries I will probably make
another<00:04:10.830> video<00:04:11.220> but<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:12.420> most<00:04:12.780> important

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
another video but the most important

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.960 
another video but the most important
thing<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:14.090> when<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.450> put<00:04:15.919> ground<00:04:16.970> this

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
thing is that when we put ground this

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.880 
thing is that when we put ground this
brown<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.540> on<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.709> outside<00:04:20.489> here<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:21.000> the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
brown here on the outside here of the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.740 
brown here on the outside here of the
lid<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.220> top<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.440> other<00:04:25.440> k<00:04:25.740> sure<00:04:26.750> he

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
lid of the top of the other k sure he

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.690 
lid of the top of the other k sure he
changed<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.169> lot<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.410> things<00:04:29.930> as<00:04:30.930> these

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
changed a lot of things as these

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.100 
changed a lot of things as these
batteries<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.030> displayed<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.720> all<00:04:33.900> this

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
batteries and displayed and all this

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.909 
batteries and displayed and all this
year<00:04:34.370> became<00:04:36.110> energized<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:40.230> perhaps<00:04:40.590> we

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
year became energized and the perhaps we

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.480 
year became energized and the perhaps we
have<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.310> think<00:04:41.610> about<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.770> video<00:04:44.250> that

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
have to think about the the video that

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.659 
have to think about the the video that
the<00:04:44.700> dragon<00:04:45.090> proposed<00:04:45.540> some<00:04:46.350> posed<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.340> go<00:04:47.490> at
