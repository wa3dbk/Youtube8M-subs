 appears on May 7 is a pretty tweet 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.809
 interesting to customize a little 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.480
 our device this tweet is called 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.429
 what screen airplane mount if you can 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.109

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.870
 beatbox repository that I'm going to

 leave down here good basically this 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 tweet what it does is create in it what 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.989
 screen of our device a small 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.379
 little button in the upper left 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.120
 to enter airplane mode as you see this 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.339
 is what screen of my device and 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.659
 in the upper left part it appears 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.610
 this new little button by poking him in the 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.310
 continuously we would go into mode 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.450
 plane and clicking it again we would come out 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.729
 of the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.009
 plane is a very useful tweet for all 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.990
 those people who for example go to 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.909
 a meeting and they do not want it to arrive 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.759
 Absolutely no calls or any 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.000
 notification and simply taking out the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.090
 tel the phone from our pocket 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.250
 and giving it to the button would enter 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.700
 airplane mode and we would not get any 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.579
 call or any notification 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.530
 this tweet is called like that and with eddie tree 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.210
 you can find it for free in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.820
 the repository of virtuosos that I am going to 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.860
 leave here good basically what it does 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.829
 this tweet is to facilitate the process of 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.929
 change the good page applications 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.590
 for example, imagine what I want 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.990
 change bag whatsapp and gmail to another 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.759
 page would click on any value 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.799
 up with times in to shake I would go 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.259
 selecting the ones I want to move in 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.390
 this case bag whatsapp and gmail 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.220
 imagine that I want to put them in the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.409
 next page would simply slide 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.220
 the finger is worth the page appears 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.579
 next and click on whatsapp bag 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.470
 and gmail as simple as this tweet is 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.390
 call auto ding without luck and you can 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.160
 find it for free in the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.230
 repository of posh that I'm going to leave you 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.329
 here below good basically what 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 does this tweet is to dim the screen 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.410
 of our device when we do not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.959
 We are using to save battery 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.060
 once we discard this tweet we are 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.579
 will create a small direct access in 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.260
 adjustments is worth it is called auto team in 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.000
 which we will be able to enable or 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.600
 disable the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 disable it when we are 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.610
 loading and disabling it in certain 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.770
 applications we can also change the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.730
 seconds before it's dim in the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.620
 screen 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.390
 I'm going to enable the tweet so that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.390
 you see, we've put three seconds 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.830
 and in three seconds as you see it dims 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.320
 the screen this saves a lot 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.990
 battery more than you think you're good 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.370
 let's put a more logical figure for 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.430
 example 15 seconds worth and for example 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.020
 you can also disable it 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.580
 tenuous in some applications that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.530
 you use a lot for example the whatsapp 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.920
 you do not want that it has tenue 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.740
 all the time or so mail this 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.680
 tuit is really very good to save 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.750
 good battery friends like lately 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.120

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.520
