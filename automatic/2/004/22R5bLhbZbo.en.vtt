what he said referring to Lauren I spoke
to<00:00:53.789> Lauren<00:00:54.120> afterwards<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.050> he<00:00:55.260> meant

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
when speaking to that guy was that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080 
when speaking to that guy was that
budgets<00:00:57.960> schedules<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.219> perceivable

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
budgets schedules and perceivable

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.540 
budgets schedules and perceivable
differences<00:01:00.660> would<00:01:00.840> narrow<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
differences would narrow not that the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.539 
differences would narrow not that the
xbox<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.539> performance<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> improving<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
xbox one performance is improving to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.060 
xbox one performance is improving to
align<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.000> ps4<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.680> physically

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
align with ps4 that is just physically

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
align with ps4 that is just physically
impossible<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.090> ps4<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:10.140> compute

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
impossible the ps4 has more compute

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.580 
impossible the ps4 has more compute
units<00:01:11.189> faster<00:01:12.150> memory<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> whole<00:01:13.110> bunch<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
units faster memory and a whole bunch of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
units faster memory and a whole bunch of
things<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.939> physically

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
things that would make that physically

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.469 
things that would make that physically
impossible<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.680> happen<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.430> yeah<00:01:17.700> he<00:01:18.240> does

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
impossible to happen so yeah he does

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
impossible to happen so yeah he does
have<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> point<00:01:19.020> obviously<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.220> saying

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
have a point obviously it's like saying

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.080 
have a point obviously it's like saying
that<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.000> someone<00:01:21.270> has<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> gtx<00:01:22.520> 570<00:01:23.520> graphics

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that if someone has a gtx 570 graphics

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
that if someone has a gtx 570 graphics
card<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.570> their<00:01:25.049> computer<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.530> i<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> gtx

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
card in their computer and i have a gtx
770<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.960> saying<00:01:28.170> oh<00:01:28.290> yeah<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> make

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
770 it's like saying oh yeah we can make

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.910 
770 it's like saying oh yeah we can make
that<00:01:29.070> gtx<00:01:29.700> 570<00:01:30.450> totally<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.290> capable<00:01:31.470> as

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that gtx 570 totally just as capable as

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.149 
that gtx 570 totally just as capable as
the<00:01:32.100> gtx<00:01:32.880> 770<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:34.259> computer<00:01:34.530> course<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the gtx 770 in your computer course you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.760 
the gtx 770 in your computer course you
can<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.960> though<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.710> not

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
can but what I think though and I'm not

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
can but what I think though and I'm not
a<00:01:38.009> hardware<00:01:38.400> engineer<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a hardware engineer and I'm not a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
a hardware engineer and I'm not a
software<00:01:39.900> coder<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:41.070> also<00:01:41.310> not

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
software coder but I'm also not

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840 
software coder but I'm also not
completely<00:01:41.939> retarded<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> feel<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
completely retarded is that I feel that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.060 
completely retarded is that I feel that
maybe<00:01:45.030> things<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> DirectX<00:01:46.320> 12<00:01:46.500> API

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
maybe things like the DirectX 12 API

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.649 
maybe things like the DirectX 12 API
coming<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.119> compatible
