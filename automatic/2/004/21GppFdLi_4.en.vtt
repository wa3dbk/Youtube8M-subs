00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello dear viewers I know I 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.029
 late the lighting conditions are pretty 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 bad but i just got on youtube 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.809
 seen that the new trailer for 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.570
 Installations and I will not leave it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.990
 take a punctual action to it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.990
 So let's get started intense 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.230
 j 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.310
 was considered 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.050
 did you see that that black 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.050
 thing 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.460
 we demanded break money 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.570
 Where 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.060
 becker 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.820

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 Bochum 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.489
 that's exactly how you do it the same way 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.599
 a trader in walhall game times 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:47.310
 back I believe that stem that chris 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.310
 somehow avoid it as the only one 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.780
 for somehow as a 1 1 1 1 in 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.260
 direction without brasov still on film 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.060
 rotate 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.819
 we are now completely digital 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.769
 changed what a logical step 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.590
 been but I would find a film 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.810
 small little prettier because the video so 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.060
 sometimes sometimes video rather 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.370
 but looks the same , says ray 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.650
 People think the same way people do 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.269
 Cinema can not believe that only 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.310
 one more month vista tsv 105 november 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.030
 is he the first trailer to the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.129
 avengers 2 people get warmer on it 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.849
 the hammer october will be just like that 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.079
 in October 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.299
 I do not know how many of you 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.040
 but we will be on site 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.959
 have the video movie with plus 1 and 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.620
 last online and I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.659
 huge on it 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.790
 then we finally have interstellar 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.690
 So the next two months would be the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.090
 absolute hammer 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.859
 I'm looking forward to industry 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.780
 yes I can describe it hardly 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.669
 if you have more sense you can 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.470
 Here are the two wanderers 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.629
 actions to the other two 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.010
 interstellar makers view him 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.919
 meanwhile 3 appeared 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.129
 and if this movie is not just new 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:04:00.220
 favorite movies now there are people 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.319
 no way out with the new xp if ok 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.810
 I upload the channel to you and what 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.389
 not my favorite movie is then you can 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.129
 you greet the love that align to 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.359
 every case 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.110
 I wish you a safe and secure 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.240
 pleasant evening stays on roll 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.240
 But it does not exaggerate for vesta 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.070
 there
