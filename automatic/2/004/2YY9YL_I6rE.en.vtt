00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.740
 I see wondered why he was going 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.270
 It works or he told me about work. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.420
 like throat 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:24.520
 He works with the throat. 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.440
 work talk about pact as well 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.790
 we talk about this 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.000
 summing up 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.960
 one here has a lot is almost the animal has 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 everywhere is amazing 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.430
 no matter if it's for sure 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 how many Brazilian tourists 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.810
 They come very very very very 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.100
 more direct system with a Brazilian 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.630
 This guy, he's going to go shopping. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.640
 love your things 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.330
 the search for Brazilian and is of a 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.540
 cuddly and will talk 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.180
 sometimes that Brazilian says something 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.900
 and see that it's Brazilian, not for the voice of 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.390
 language and was very well befriends 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.370
 Quick as to come more often with me in the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.410
 The market would talk to me alone with my 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.540
 not the people you have to in that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.080
 restaurant is a little 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.570
 restaurant, his name behind 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.100
 rains in this restaurant are the good 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.220
 attack is to have my name here can 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.840
 talk that I'll keep you short when 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.080
 You go to a restaurant, he won. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.770
 start it does the same thing all 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.540
 the store of pedro 16 store clothing stores 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.210
 of any shoe provided it is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.250
 he makes a cake that makes a 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.320
 goal does not make a deal 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.000
 the owner of the store and he is throwing people 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.950
 houses shops and today very interesting and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.700
 it's known 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.010
 so why does not he work a lot? 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.600
 heavy because they work harder to talk 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.540
 keep walking befriend the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.470
 sending people was a lot of 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.900
 card and 1 point before May when 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.640
 the people in the store giving no 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.290
 is doing nothing wrong by giving 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.330
 indications 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.830
 where is the good thing for this good thing? 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.380
 if the thing because I do not know why I did not 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.270
 I do not even know the stores who works but he 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.720
 is changing tourists to certain 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.610
 shops and the shop owner when he takes the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.610
 He gives a little card 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.690
 the commission to him that the sale was 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.690
 made 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.180
 I did not even say anything interesting to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.970
 them because before then I know that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.160
 tour guides do this 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.220
 for example if you come package tour 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.830
 You so pure 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.860
 and I have to put up with it, it takes you where 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.880
 Whatever you do not know anything here goes 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.860
 take you to the presence of the dye 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.840
 I speak Brazilian, it's better to take care of 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.810
 of the people you will be paid without hunger 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.850
 He remembered that this is not wrong. 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.050
 he would take to the shops that lead to 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.420
 all the places 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.090
 is their job takes where he will 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.000
 a higher commission is not where the best 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.190
 price or where the best food 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.210
 This is an Ethical Approach 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.660
 here 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:21.140
 Daniel, I found it very very 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.640
 interesting and creative for he spoke 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.100
 so I did not even ask was very cool 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.890
 for them it is that he goes but he knows that it is 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.410
 has lloyd's treasures also 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.870
 He told me six more people. 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.430
 He said it was two since he talks. 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.680
 which was 5 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.930
 These things, he told me. 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.730
 that I was happy than sad 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.560
 I was happy with the creativity 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:51.770
 his management and tried what to do 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.690
 to change people in the store 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.879
 But then I was sad because he 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.110
 He spoke thus to taking 10 doses 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:02.780
 people and he said that this is now mine. 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.180
 question that I wait that I did 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.460
 to him it was like you know it 's not a 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.080
 problem if you do not change your 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.509
 Mentality 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.240
 that is, with Brazilian mentality 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.879
 to that state months you think the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.860
 people go here to get your leg 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.610
 you do not go forward 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.000
 No one is here to pass you by . 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.500
 God 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.259
 people have their lives too much 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.720
 making the leg too much thinking 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.800
 so I was sad with more like 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.330
 that he gave me 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.970
 that's what he's been here for a year and a half 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.780
 he spoke but still with this mentality 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.500
 that people spend so far is going 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.919
 in one step 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:50.229
 I do not know but an unnecessary comment 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:53.120
 that he did good and this is just one more 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.479
