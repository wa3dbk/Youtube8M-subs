yeah<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.390> articulated<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> small<00:00:29.359> case

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
yeah it's articulated it's a small case

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.250 
yeah it's articulated it's a small case
trencher<00:00:32.030> but<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> frame<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
trencher but I just got this frame and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.510 
trencher but I just got this frame and
going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> make<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> project<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
going to make a project out of it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
going to make a project out of it
probably<00:00:38.730> put<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> loader<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:41.750> driven<00:00:42.750> off

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
probably put a loader on a driven off

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.330 
probably put a loader on a driven off
from<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.649> sprocket<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.930> which<00:00:45.930> is

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
from that sprocket right there which is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.750 
from that sprocket right there which is
number<00:00:47.340> 60<00:00:47.789> chain<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:51.320> anyway<00:00:52.320> it's

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
number 60 chain and anyway it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.340 
number 60 chain and anyway it's
four-wheel<00:00:53.760> drive<00:00:54.530> articulated<00:00:55.699> very<00:00:56.699> small

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
four-wheel drive articulated very small

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.010 
four-wheel drive articulated very small
about<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> three<00:00:58.829> foot<00:00:59.100> width<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.780> very

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
about a three foot width it's not very

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
about a three foot width it's not very
wide<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:03.000> even<00:01:03.090> know<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.329> long<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
wide and I don't even know how long it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.530 
wide and I don't even know how long it
is<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.110> haven't<00:01:04.290> measured<00:01:05.689> but<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> my

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
is I haven't measured but this is my

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.649 
is I haven't measured but this is my
next<00:01:09.810> project<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:11.150> think<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
next project I think what I'm going to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
next project I think what I'm going to
do<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:14.600> put<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> hydraulic<00:01:16.170> motor<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
do is put a hydraulic motor on there and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
do is put a hydraulic motor on there and
drive<00:01:17.460> etch<00:01:18.650> sprocket<00:01:20.000> these<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.299> Dana

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
drive etch sprocket these are two Dana

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.920 
drive etch sprocket these are two Dana
rear<00:01:21.900> ends<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.470> 401<00:01:23.659> approx<00:01:24.659> 401<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
rear ends are 401 approx 401 and the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
rear ends are 401 approx 401 and the
drivetrain<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.860> looks<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:29.729> shape

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
drivetrain it looks to be in good shape

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.499 
drivetrain it looks to be in good shape
no<00:01:30.329> leaks<00:01:30.659> tight<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:35.270> I'll<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.479> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
no leaks tight so I'll get that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
no leaks tight so I'll get that
hydraulic<00:01:37.049> motor<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.650> set<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hydraulic motor and set it up here I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
hydraulic motor and set it up here I
think<00:01:38.670> I've<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.540> round<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.020> going

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
think I've got one round here I'm going

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
think I've got one round here I'm going
to<00:01:40.350> try<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> Charlaine<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to try and use it's a Charlaine it's the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.389 
to try and use it's a Charlaine it's the
minute<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.340> hydraulic<00:01:45.060> motor<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.720> I'm

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
minute there's a hydraulic motor and I'm

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.410 
minute there's a hydraulic motor and I'm
thinking<00:01:47.399> about<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:50.540> Charlaine<00:01:53.390> stick<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
thinking about using a Charlaine stick a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.499 
thinking about using a Charlaine stick a
number<00:01:55.020> 60<00:01:55.439> sprocket<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.490> half<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.270> size

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
number 60 sprocket about half the size

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.230 
number 60 sprocket about half the size
of<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.079> there<00:01:58.439> try<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.210> and<00:02:00.210> see

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
of that one on there try that and see

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.810 
of that one on there try that and see
what<00:02:00.689> kind<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> travel<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.579> kind

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
what kind of travel I get and what kind

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
what kind of travel I get and what kind
of<00:02:02.880> power<00:02:04.040> anyway<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> plan<00:02:06.680> I'll<00:02:07.680> run

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
of power anyway that's the plan I'll run

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.880 
of power anyway that's the plan I'll run
up<00:02:08.190> pump<00:02:09.179> off<00:02:09.420> from<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> engine<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.259> put<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
up pump off from the engine I put on it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
up pump off from the engine I put on it
right<00:02:11.879> now<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> engine<00:02:12.780> looks<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.170> it's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
right now the engine looks like it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.270 
right now the engine looks like it's
going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:15.140> I've<00:02:16.140> got<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.410> good<00:02:16.710> 10<00:02:17.010> horse

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
going to be a I've got a good 10 horse

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.590 
going to be a I've got a good 10 horse
kohler<00:02:17.810> i'll<00:02:18.810> probably<00:02:19.080> put<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.800> here

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
kohler i'll probably put that on here

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.330 
kohler i'll probably put that on here
anyway<00:02:21.600> i'm<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.990> mount<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.290> pump<00:02:22.650> or

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
anyway i'm going to mount this pump or

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.710 
anyway i'm going to mount this pump or
this<00:02:23.550> motor<00:02:24.240> hydraulic<00:02:24.900> motor<00:02:26.450> over<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.570> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this motor hydraulic motor over on the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
other side hinge it right in there so i

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.160 
other side hinge it right in there so i
can<00:02:32.240> write<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.770> tabs<00:02:34.770> coming<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
can write on those tabs coming up and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.850 
can write on those tabs coming up and
adjust<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.530> chain<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:38.010> way<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
adjust the chain that way so that's the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.240 
adjust the chain that way so that's the
deal

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
deal
