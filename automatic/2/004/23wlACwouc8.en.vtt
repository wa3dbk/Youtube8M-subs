00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.890
 Althusmann fans and 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.910
 the consumption 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.590
 the last matchday of this season 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.179
 horrified Breth 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.079
 Part skating game of this game day 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.379
 TSG Hoffenheim Bgm 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.669
 FC Schalke 04 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.669
 the topgame 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 and my personal top game 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.489
 FSV Mainz 05 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.489
 in the first FC Kaiserslautern 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.750
 Now we come to the tips 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.410
 that acts game day 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.860
 the first encounter is between the TSG Hoffenheim and the horse table own 4 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.020
 and 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.630
 this encounter 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.630
 to be two 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.910
 Hoffenheim 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.240
 Well, not one such via deep sea riad parted now 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.530
 though in a row 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.530
 2 2 1 lost 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.100
 the next meeting 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.909
 Borussia Dortmund against contractions Fortell Wolfsburg 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.740
 this encounter carpet on a draw on a 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 second though 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.450
 since the Wolfsburg 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 had the last game against Mainz with 3 0 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 I think that now Wolfsburg leads part time to 2 0 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.030
 but to get the Dortmunder because right now they have one 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.750
 good game delivered 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050
 against Stuttgart 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050
 therefore 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.820
 the next meeting 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.170
 the Hamburg sports club against labor 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 first FC Nuremberg 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.419
 Hamburg has the last song 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.950
 both matches 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.149
 4 0 won 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.790
 that will not continue the hamburger now Arber 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.790
 we will still cheer with a 3 2 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.169
 the next meeting is between 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.539
 Hannover 96 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.329
 Bayer Leverkusen 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.519
 and 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.789
 I type 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.499
 that Hanover 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.889
 his first defeat stops 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.889
 against Leverkusen world one to two 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.650
 Hanover so far only at home twice 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.230
 won 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.769
 the next meeting 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.649
 Borussia Monchengladbach 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.379
 ITG 8 Frankfurt 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.139
 Worms 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.969
 at the Gladbachern 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.449
 on the last matchday one already happened with six goals 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.109
 check and cleared 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.589
 I think 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.729
 because not 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.639
 win again so high now 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.679
 but we will definitely win in March 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.679
 2 to 1 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.089
 Frankfurt has not played well so far this season 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.709
 and Dirk Bach definitely uses the motivation to play perfect wine 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.129
 the next meeting 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.629
 is between 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.879
 SC Freiburg and p on in Stuttgart 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:58.449
 this encounter is deadly on a one-on-one draw 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.309
 The next match is to clear the top match of this game day 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:10.499
 Bayern Munich 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.249
 and d 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:14.899
 SV Werder Bremen 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.679
 the match I also hint at a draw when I'm on a 2 to 2 basis 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.340
 to take part in a foundation Werder Bremen was the first team in 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.460
 some of his 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.139
 had met 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.020
 let's come to the Sunday games 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.020
 to cry personal but play between the FSV Mainz 05 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080
 first FC Kaiserslautern and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.389
 this encounter against Weiz 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.069
 Hattingen 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.370
 not a draw so Ben Ammar al-hakim is this match 

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:55.779
 Draw out 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.199
 after said 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.069
 it will be the eighth time so draw to build Bauverein 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.289
 and from the last match of the matchday 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.169
 that is 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.169
 FC Cologne against St Pauli 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.969
 I z times 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.550
 on Cologne 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.550
 on a 2 2 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.589
