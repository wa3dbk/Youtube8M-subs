00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.500
 today I was dreaming with a new 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.630
 video is how tied his hair 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.580
 with clip extensions because 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.519
 it's not always easy especially 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 that we have a tendency to really ruin his 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.920
 tongs when one when one attaches them 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.710
 so here it is really small 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.230
 tips that I found and I hope that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.449
 this video you well here I am you 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.140
 let it look 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:34.219
 so for a start you will do a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 kind of wheels on the top of the skull 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.680
 so you can do something 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.770
 approximate in you are not 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.550
 obliged to do something good 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.550
 geometric 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.079
 so I'm doing a little bit of it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
 because I actually like it when my 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.079
 ponytail comes back comes back on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.079
 side so come on put your elastic 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.230
 So that's what gives that 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.240
 simply and then you go 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.210
 so take your extensions and you 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:35.580
 will come eclipsed all around the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:35.580
 tail up 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.450
 the secret behind to not damage 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.760
 in fact your little claws it's from 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.090
 come 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.450
 eclipsed in the bottom of your tail of 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 horse 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 ie as a vote that will go up 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.510
 you eclipsed your extensions to the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.430
 down in two bases instead of eclipsed 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.790
 so is you all the way down to the excess of 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.790
 base is awarded 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.520
 so that's it once it's done 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.270
 look like nothing, do not be afraid 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.220
 there you will come and do your so 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.570
 the interest of having kept locks on 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.070
 the front is that when you go 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:59.860
 pull your hair in fact it's going to come 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:03.870
 cover the tongs so I prefer myself 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.870
 do first with your hands 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.740
 and after polishing with the brush 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.599
 so if we see a little bit of your purposes 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.659
 do not panic you can always 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:51.980
 cheated come knock down some hair 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:04:17.539
 above you come lacquered and here is your 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:19.690
 ponytail and really does 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.690
 Warning 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.229
 tonight
