adjust<00:02:39.940> these<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:42.160> those<00:02:42.400> three<00:02:42.700> are

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
adjust these in in those three are

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.509 
adjust these in in those three are
options<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.530> haven't<00:02:44.530> taken<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.860> closer<00:02:45.100> look<00:02:45.340> at

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
options I haven't taken a closer look at

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.539 
options I haven't taken a closer look at
them<00:02:45.700> walk<00:02:46.030> there<00:02:46.269> or<00:02:46.600> keep<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.440> off<00:02:47.650> no<00:02:48.040> idea<00:02:48.340> I

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
them walk there or keep it off no idea I

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.449 
them walk there or keep it off no idea I
have<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.420> try<00:02:49.570> around<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.959> bit<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:51.190> okay

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
have to try around a bit but it's okay

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.880 
have to try around a bit but it's okay
in<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.700> case<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.440> something<00:02:53.440> else<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.709> wet

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
in this case and something else is wet

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.360 
in this case and something else is wet
when<00:02:54.459> I'm<00:02:54.579> moving<00:02:54.850> my<00:02:54.880> head<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> bit<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:57.010> i'm

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
when I'm moving my head a bit the i'm

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.690 
when I'm moving my head a bit the i'm
not<00:02:57.820> using<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.480> mouse<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.660> walk<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:01.750> caf

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
not using the mouse to walk in caf

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.190 
not using the mouse to walk in caf
that's<00:03:03.700> because<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.329> head<00:03:04.450> tracking

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.600 

class<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.530> looks<00:03:13.680> great<00:03:16.220> looking<00:03:17.220> came<00:03:17.430> back

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
class that looks great looking came back

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.240 
class that looks great looking came back
then<00:03:17.879> i<00:03:23.030> tried<00:03:24.030> half<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.659> two<00:03:24.870> with<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.799> Tiki

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
then i tried half of two with the Tiki

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.780 
then i tried half of two with the Tiki
one<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.730> while<00:03:27.269> back<00:03:27.860> when<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:28.980> looked<00:03:29.190> great<00:03:29.489> um

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
one a while back when it looked great um

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.240 
one a while back when it looked great um
there<00:03:30.720> was<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.840> problem<00:03:31.140> because<00:03:31.409> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
there was a problem because the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.569 
there was a problem because the
resolution<00:03:32.819> wasn't<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.239> par<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.430> items<00:03:35.430> of

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
resolution wasn't up to par so items of

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.229 
resolution wasn't up to par so items of
a<00:03:35.730> very<00:03:36.150> far<00:03:36.450> back<00:03:36.629> I<00:03:37.250> couldn't<00:03:38.250> actually<00:03:38.700> make

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
a very far back I couldn't actually make

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.210 
a very far back I couldn't actually make
the<00:03:39.390> mobs<00:03:39.659> really<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.470> now<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:42.500> guess<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.769> guess

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the mobs really and now I guess I guess

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.789 
the mobs really and now I guess I guess
as<00:03:44.849> far<00:03:44.909> as<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> shooter<00:03:45.359> goes<00:03:45.629> I<00:03:45.900> will<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.650> be

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
as far as the shooter goes I will not be

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.149 
as far as the shooter goes I will not be
able<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.129> correctly<00:03:47.640> aim<00:03:48.139> at<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.440> enemies<00:03:49.950> and

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
able to correctly aim at the enemies and

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.550 
able to correctly aim at the enemies and
not<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.879> guess<00:03:51.180> what<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.690> blur<00:03:51.959> back<00:03:52.260> there

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
not just guess what the blur back there

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:06.390 
not just guess what the blur back there
is

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.630 

even<00:04:07.400> though<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.700> game<00:04:07.850> is<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.030> bit<00:04:08.240> older<00:04:08.600> now

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
even though the game is a bit older now

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.449 
even though the game is a bit older now
still<00:04:10.640> looks<00:04:10.819> great<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.420> in<00:04:11.600> VR<00:04:11.930> it's

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
still looks great and in VR it's

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:20.470 
still looks great and in VR it's
fantastic<00:04:18.700> here's<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.790> demonstration<00:04:19.970> after

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
fantastic here's a demonstration after

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.110 
fantastic here's a demonstration after
positional<00:04:21.019> tracking<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:24.430> can<00:04:25.430> didn't<00:04:25.760> take<00:04:26.090> a

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
positional tracking I can didn't take a

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.909 
positional tracking I can didn't take a
really<00:04:26.480> close<00:04:26.600> look<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:30.260> no<00:04:30.440> motion<00:04:30.740> sickness

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
really close look and no motion sickness

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.980 
really close look and no motion sickness
yet<00:04:31.160> um<00:04:31.430> i<00:04:31.700> guess<00:04:31.910> it's<00:04:32.120> because<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.690> moves<00:04:32.900> a

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
yet um i guess it's because it moves a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.940 
yet um i guess it's because it moves a
bit<00:04:33.020> slower<00:04:33.680> than<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.580> great<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.390> demo<00:04:35.690> i<00:04:36.020> gave

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
bit slower than the great to demo i gave

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.770 
bit slower than the great to demo i gave
