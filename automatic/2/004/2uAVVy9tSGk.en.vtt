00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.400
 this is the interpolation example of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 movement with a personalized guide 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.439
 for a change of figures we are going to take the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 text in this case instead of taking a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.110
 of these tools we are going to make a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.110
 letter any 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.060
 and we're going to make this letter 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.130
 move from one place to another by 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.780
 motion interpolation 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.880
 to do the interpolation of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.630
 move we should make button 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.070
 right turn into symbol this 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.340
 symbol we are going to put the same name 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.720
 r type movie clip 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 here we are going to say that the record is 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.070
 in the middle later on we would be 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.080
 seeing what it is for what it is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.080
 record let's accept 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.970
 and then we go to the frame we make button 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.650
 straight 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.650
 motion interpolation 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.539
 we see as we have seen in another video 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.189
 before it is automatically created 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.450
 the interpolation of movements what 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.070
 we have to do at this point is 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.979
 displace 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.030
 this figure is from one place to another and the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.850
 program in this version shows us the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.530
 path through which the war goes in this 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.260
 case from one place to another this way 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.180
 we can customize them 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.820
 this way 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.670
 well now from the moment we are going to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.010
 see another way to customize the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.400
 path is as easy as this in this 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.400
 case if you can create a common layer 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.660
 we do not stop in the first frame 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.030
 we take a tool can be the 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.640
 brush in pencil can be the line then 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.130
 or the pen 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.659
 we take the pencil tool we 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.000
 we set it to be in the option of 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.350
 softened so that the stroke that little more 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 perfect 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.390
 and we are going to do something like that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.310
 if we need to perfect it even more 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.689
 we can have a problem 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.670
 because at this point for example not 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.230
 it's very good in that case we'll have it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.060
 what to do back 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.560
 I think no problem we will 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.450
 try out 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.370
 to the elections I'm going to tell you to 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.720
 smoothed more smoothed and the beige a 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.160
 little more 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
 I keep seeing that we can get to have 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.830
 problem there but hopefully it's not 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.940
 this stroke that I made in a common layer what 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.830
 what I'm going to do is double click on the top 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.440
 right button 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.569
 cut it and paste it in this first 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.370
 frame 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.040
 I have the sheet and I put it on it 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.349
 can be control z to undo I'm going to 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.540
 put it better right button paste prompted 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.220
 and institute is for lopez exactly 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 in the same place that believes in the other 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.989
 cap 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.989
 and there we have then 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.560
 the interpolation of movement with a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.660
 personalized guide in this case happens very 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.380
 fast we would have to give the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.330
 way to reduce the speed we can 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.920
 reduce the speed of all the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.770
 movie or we could also lengthen 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.970
 and the frames for this 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.760
 go more slowly 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 the same as in the case of 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.100
 interpolation than the classic with guide 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.810
 this road is not seen we see it 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.090
 that we are the designers but when 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.040
 we give control enter 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.010
 in the flex player window in the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.670
 window shown on Internet 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.670
 I had a little problem 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.260
 let's try again to see 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.450
 the road is not seen if we 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.910
 we would like to see, we will have to create in 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.520
 another layer or from or instead of cutting it 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.930
 leave it copyable throw it for example 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.959
 so that we also stay 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.230
 in this other layer if we leave it here yes 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.079
 you would see this is the example of 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.590
 Motion interpolation with a guide 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.590
 customized
