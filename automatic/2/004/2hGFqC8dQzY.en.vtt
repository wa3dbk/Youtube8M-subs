that one's all up and down framework and
this<00:00:56.770> guy<00:00:57.010> these<00:00:57.550> are<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.850> tools<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.270> you

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
this guy these are the tools that you

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.330 
this guy these are the tools that you
would<00:00:58.600> need<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.960> do<00:00:59.080> this<00:00:59.230> job<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.860> if<00:00:59.920> I<00:01:00.070> were

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
would need to do this job and if I were

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.130 
would need to do this job and if I were
dumb<00:01:00.550> enough<00:01:00.580> to<00:01:00.850> do<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.300> job<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:01.720> I'm<00:01:01.870> not

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
dumb enough to do this job that I'm not

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:13.510 
dumb enough to do this job that I'm not
so<00:01:02.920> he<00:01:03.040> George<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.460> over<00:01:03.700> here

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.700 

now<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.700> does<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.820> mean<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> have

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
now what does that mean when you have

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.290 
now what does that mean when you have
delamination<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:17.610> happens<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.120> the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
delamination what happens is the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.280 
delamination what happens is the
fiberglass<00:01:18.930> itself<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:20.610> separated<00:01:21.330> allowing

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
fiberglass itself get separated allowing

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.900 
fiberglass itself get separated allowing
the<00:01:22.380> saltwater<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.190> get<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> foam

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
the saltwater to get into the foam

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.320 
the saltwater to get into the foam
saturating<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.870> foam<00:01:25.200> inside<00:01:26.160> now<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.300> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
saturating the foam inside now a lot of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
saturating the foam inside now a lot of
people<00:01:27.480> think<00:01:27.870> well<00:01:28.050> with<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.620> does<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
people think well with what does that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
people think well with what does that
matter<00:01:29.100> why<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.580> I<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.880> leave<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.380> well<00:01:31.380> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
matter why can I just leave it well you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.820 
matter why can I just leave it well you
can<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.000> problem<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.560> foam

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
can but the problem is is that the foam

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.340 
can but the problem is is that the foam
inside<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.700> skeg<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.180> rudder<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.600> kind

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
inside the skeg and the rudder is kind

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
inside the skeg and the rudder is kind
of<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.560> shear<00:01:37.920> structure<00:01:38.580> we<00:01:38.880> are<00:01:39.030> building

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of like shear structure we are building

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630 
of like shear structure we are building
it<00:01:39.810> keeps<00:01:40.050> everything<00:01:40.380> together<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.340> really

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it keeps everything together and really

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.090 
it keeps everything together and really
tight<00:01:41.930> once<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.050> get<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> water<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.920> there

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
tight once you get the water up in there

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
tight once you get the water up in there
it<00:01:44.250> starts<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> separate<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:46.050> gets

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it starts to separate and it gets

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
it starts to separate and it gets
waterlogged<00:01:46.740> adding<00:01:47.190> weight<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.510> will

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
waterlogged adding weight and will

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.750 
waterlogged adding weight and will
actually<00:01:49.170> start<00:01:49.440> rotting<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.979> fiberglass

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
actually start rotting the fiberglass

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.320 
actually start rotting the fiberglass
from<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.450> inside<00:01:51.869> out

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.170 

to<00:02:00.330> work<00:02:00.450> third<00:02:00.750> day<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.640> now<00:02:02.640> remember<00:02:03.030> we

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to work third day now now remember we

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
to work third day now now remember we
have<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.390> remove<00:02:03.660> everything<00:02:04.020> awful<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.710> yet

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
have to remove everything awful just yet

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.120 
have to remove everything awful just yet
and<00:02:05.550> have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.480> take<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.690> grinding<00:02:07.290> wheel<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.980> get

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and have to take a grinding wheel to get

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.270 
and have to take a grinding wheel to get
the<00:02:08.430> answer<00:02:09.270> we<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.540> all<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.960> pieces<00:02:10.350> that's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the answer we have all the pieces that's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.500 
the answer we have all the pieces that's
underneath<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.880> sound

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
underneath that sound

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.000 
underneath that sound
the<00:02:13.020> first<00:02:13.260> should<00:02:13.410> take<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.680> adhesive

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the first should take an adhesive

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550 
the first should take an adhesive
remover<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.300> remove<00:02:15.420> as<00:02:15.840> much<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.260> by

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
remover and remove as much of that by

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.040 
remover and remove as much of that by
hand<00:02:16.860> first<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:19.650> how<00:02:19.860> shiny

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
hand first and see how shiny

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.200 
hand first and see how shiny
ready<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.670> pretty<00:02:23.030> threats

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
ready this is so this is pretty threats

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.490 
ready this is so this is pretty threats
to<00:02:26.210> watch<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:27.680> when<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.310> discovered

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
to watch now when we discovered
