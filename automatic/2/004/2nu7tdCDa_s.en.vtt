so i picked the maple sheet the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.650 
so i picked the maple sheet the
orientation<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> board<00:00:45.210> i'm<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
orientation to the board i'm going to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.569 
orientation to the board i'm going to
have<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> left<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have this be on the left side of the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.920 
have this be on the left side of the
bookcase<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
bookcase so that would be the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.439 
bookcase so that would be the
orientation<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.370> back<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
orientation the back would be this a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.200 
orientation the back would be this a
shelf<00:00:52.110> would<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.680> aside<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.489> divider<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
shelf would be that aside or divider is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.680 
shelf would be that aside or divider is
this<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.530> height<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.520> 72<00:00:57.059> inches

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this the height is going to be 72 inches

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.950 
this the height is going to be 72 inches
the<00:00:58.530> depth<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.430> 11<00:00:59.850> inches<00:00:59.960> what

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the depth is going to be 11 inches what

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
the depth is going to be 11 inches what
I<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.500> set<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> grain<00:01:02.940> direction

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I want to do is set the grain direction

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.870 
I want to do is set the grain direction
to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> height<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> board<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.729> can

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
to the height of the board which you can

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
to the height of the board which you can
see<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.330> image<00:01:06.630> area<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.619> grain<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
see in this image area that the grain is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.390 
see in this image area that the grain is
running<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.939> direction<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> click

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
running in that direction so if I click

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
running in that direction so if I click
OK<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> point<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:14.189> board<00:01:14.760> appears<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:16.049> my

this case of the project also add 0 you

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.090 
this case of the project also add 0 you
want<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.720> make<00:01:49.840> sure<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:50.260> change<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.830> name

because in assemblies or projects with

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.150 
because in assemblies or projects with
many<00:01:56.740> boards<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.369> becomes<00:01:57.790> very<00:01:58.030> difficult<00:01:59.160> to

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
many boards it becomes very difficult to

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.850 
many boards it becomes very difficult to
know<00:02:00.490> what<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.910> are<00:02:01.080> working<00:02:02.080> with<00:02:02.320> unless
