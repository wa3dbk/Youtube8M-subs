00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.340
 padlock when we do not know what will be 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.110

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 but the the key in the container is 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.730
 open so that's why that's what we 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.399

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.020
 correctly position the shots that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:04.770

 that I was not seen the rector but that's 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.310
