00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you can't see any more gelatin crystals

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.260 
you can't see any more gelatin crystals
anymore<00:01:34.189> okay<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.250> I've<00:01:35.520> been<00:01:35.549> stirring<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
to cool down that might take about

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.289 
to cool down that might take about
twenty<00:01:54.110> ten<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> twenty<00:01:55.530> minutes<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.299> yep

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
have to do so yeah oh we didn't turn out

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.599 
have to do so yeah oh we didn't turn out
quite<00:02:52.079> right<00:02:52.560> as<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.250> see<00:02:53.579> they<00:02:54.180> will<00:02:54.359> melted

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
quite right as you see they will melted

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.509 
quite right as you see they will melted
but<00:02:56.689> if<00:02:57.689> you<00:02:57.840> do<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.109> method<00:02:58.439> that<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.650> did<00:02:59.069> it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
but if you do the method that I did it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.179 
but if you do the method that I did it
should<00:02:59.879> turn<00:03:00.120> out<00:03:00.299> great

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
should turn out great

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.369 
should turn out great
um<00:03:02.189> but<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.730> recommend<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.419> use<00:03:03.569> an<00:03:03.719> actual<00:03:03.959> mold

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
um but I recommend to use an actual mold

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.699 
um but I recommend to use an actual mold
