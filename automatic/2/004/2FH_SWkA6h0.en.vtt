00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
not quite sure what strength does for

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.930 
not quite sure what strength does for
offensive<00:01:55.270> lineman<00:01:56.369> obviously<00:01:57.369> you<00:01:57.520> think<00:01:57.729> it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
offensive lineman obviously you think it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.309 
offensive lineman obviously you think it
would<00:01:58.060> give<00:01:58.209> them<00:01:58.420> more<00:01:58.569> of<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.750> push<00:01:58.899> but

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
would give them more of a push but

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.350 
would give them more of a push but
wouldn't<00:01:59.709> that<00:01:59.770> be<00:02:00.100> impact<00:02:00.610> or<00:02:00.880> no<00:02:01.119> impact

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
wouldn't that be impact or no impact

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.249 
wouldn't that be impact or no impact
like<00:02:01.750> pancakes<00:02:03.030> well<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.060> guess<00:02:04.600> strength<00:02:04.990> just

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
like pancakes well I guess strength just

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.850 
like pancakes well I guess strength just
might<00:02:05.439> be<00:02:05.619> how<00:02:05.979> good<00:02:06.250> they<00:02:06.610> holds<00:02:07.000> up<00:02:07.440> that<00:02:08.440> man

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
might be how good they holds up that man

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.650 
might be how good they holds up that man
maybe<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.220> should<00:02:09.519> look<00:02:09.759> into<00:02:09.970> strength<00:02:10.390> more

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
maybe I should look into strength more

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.900 
maybe I should look into strength more
