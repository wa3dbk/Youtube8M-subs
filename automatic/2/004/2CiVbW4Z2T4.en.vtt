00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
running and also - it produces that nice

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.179 
running and also - it produces that nice
quality<00:01:57.119> sound<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.439> actually<00:01:58.590> took<00:01:58.979> out

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
quality sound so if I actually took out

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.350 
quality sound so if I actually took out
the<00:02:00.259> mic<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.060> sec

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.390 

so<00:02:05.960> I've<00:02:06.230> taken<00:02:06.410> out<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.740> mic<00:02:06.890> right<00:02:07.070> now<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
so I've taken out the mic right now and

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.980 
so I've taken out the mic right now and
you<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.210> sounds<00:02:08.720> very

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
you can see that it sounds very

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.110 
you can see that it sounds very
accurately<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.070> really<00:02:10.310> bucket<00:02:10.759> type<00:02:10.940> of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
accurately it's a really bucket type of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.270 
accurately it's a really bucket type of
noise<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.900> that's<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.170> reason<00:02:12.470> why<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.650> wanted

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
noise and that's the reason why I wanted

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.560 
noise and that's the reason why I wanted
to<00:02:13.340> share<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.150> show<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.390> what

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
to share that with you to show you what

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.340 
to share that with you to show you what
it<00:02:14.660> sounds<00:02:14.900> like

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
it sounds like

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.860 
it sounds like
and<00:02:15.950> now<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.220> mics<00:02:16.550> plugged<00:02:16.850> back<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and now the mics plugged back in so you

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.600 
and now the mics plugged back in so you
can<00:02:18.020> tell<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.920> makes<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.310> huge<00:02:19.520> difference

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
can tell that it makes a huge difference

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
can tell that it makes a huge difference
to<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> quality<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.600> sound<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.050> highly

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
to the quality of sound and I highly

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.260 
to the quality of sound and I highly
highly<00:02:21.470> recommend<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.640> whatever<00:02:23.030> video

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
highly recommend that whatever video

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.570 
highly recommend that whatever video
you're<00:02:23.660> doing<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.500> make<00:02:24.860> sure<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.370> do

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
you're doing to make sure that you do

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.010 
you're doing to make sure that you do
have<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.880> sound<00:02:26.120> doesn't<00:02:26.720> matter<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
have the sound doesn't matter the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.050 
have the sound doesn't matter the
quality<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.800> videos<00:02:28.070> not<00:02:28.220> too<00:02:28.400> good<00:02:28.670> you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
quality of the videos not too good you

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.820 
quality of the videos not too good you
know<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.600> get<00:02:29.720> away<00:02:29.780> with<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.200> but<00:02:30.710> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
know you can get away with that but the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.220 
know you can get away with that but the
sound<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.370> very<00:02:31.640> very<00:02:31.910> important<00:02:32.390> special

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
sound is very very important special

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.750 
sound is very very important special
effects<00:02:33.530> adding<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:33.980> sounds<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.490> stuff<00:02:34.610> like

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
effects adding on sounds and stuff like

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.910 
effects adding on sounds and stuff like
that<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.330> reason<00:02:35.540> why<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.260> lot<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.530> movies

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that is the reason why a lot of movies

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.160 
that is the reason why a lot of movies
are<00:02:37.100> successful<00:02:37.610> because<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.360> sound<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.810> very

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
are successful because the sound is very

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.960 
are successful because the sound is very
very<00:02:39.410> good<00:02:39.530> quality<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.550> don't<00:02:40.730> see<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
very good quality and you don't see the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.280 
very good quality and you don't see the
behind<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.360> sense<00:02:41.540> because<00:02:41.750> usually<00:02:41.930> they've

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
behind it sense because usually they've

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.570 
behind it sense because usually they've
got<00:02:42.440> mics<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.860> at<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.040> top

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
got mics up at the top

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.520 
got mics up at the top
they've<00:02:44.150> got<00:02:44.300> mics<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.750> side<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.320> stuff

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
they've got mics on the side and stuff

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.500 
they've got mics on the side and stuff
like<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:45.860> they<00:02:46.010> tried<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.310> capture<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.000> best

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
like then they tried to capture the best

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.140 
like then they tried to capture the best
quality<00:02:48.020> sound<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.500> possible<00:02:49.010> all<00:02:49.850> right<00:02:49.970> so

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
quality sound if possible all right so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.290 
quality sound if possible all right so
