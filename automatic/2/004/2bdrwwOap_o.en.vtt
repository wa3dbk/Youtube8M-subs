and<00:00:49.040> most<00:00:49.310> that<00:00:49.550> was<00:00:49.730> gained<00:00:50.000> through<00:00:50.390> two

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
and most that was gained through two

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.320 
and most that was gained through two
initiatives<00:00:51.260> on<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.650> tractor<00:00:52.490> side<00:00:52.850> one<00:00:53.180> was

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
initiatives on the tractor side one was

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.810 
initiatives on the tractor side one was
the<00:00:53.480> APU<00:00:53.930> was<00:00:54.560> it<00:00:54.800> was<00:00:54.950> a<00:00:54.980> big<00:00:55.220> chunk<00:00:55.520> of<00:00:55.610> that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
the APU was it was a big chunk of that

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.970 
the APU was it was a big chunk of that
and<00:00:56.180> training<00:00:56.990> our<00:00:57.080> drivers<00:00:57.410> how<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.590> use<00:00:57.800> that

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
and training our drivers how to use that

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.680 
and training our drivers how to use that
efficiently<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.910> second<00:00:59.390> thing<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.600> just

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
efficiently the second thing is just

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.990 
efficiently the second thing is just
training<00:01:00.170> whether<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.800> be<00:01:00.920> driving<00:01:01.490> in<00:01:01.700> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
training whether it be driving in the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.790 
training whether it be driving in the
RPM<00:01:02.720> range<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.200> don't<00:01:03.500> need<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.710> be

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
RPM range that you don't need to be

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.500 
RPM range that you don't need to be
driving<00:01:04.009> in<00:01:04.339> educating<00:01:04.879> them<00:01:05.089> where<00:01:05.299> does

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
driving in educating them where does

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.480 
driving in educating them where does
shift<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.140> where<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.680> sweet<00:01:06.950> spot<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.400> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
shift and where the sweet spot of the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.790 
shift and where the sweet spot of the
engine<00:01:07.910> is<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:08.750> really<00:01:09.200> understanding

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
engine is and in really understanding

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.440 
engine is and in really understanding
and<00:01:09.950> talking<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.520> drivers<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:11.090> working

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
and talking to the drivers and working

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.480 
and talking to the drivers and working
with<00:01:11.600> their<00:01:11.780> fuel<00:01:11.990> management<00:01:12.350> department<00:01:13.010> we

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
with their fuel management department we

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.250 
with their fuel management department we
discovered<00:01:13.910> lots<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.300> things<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.810> enabled<00:01:15.170> us

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
discovered lots of things and enabled us

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.780 
discovered lots of things and enabled us
to<00:01:15.320> really<00:01:15.710> kind<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.950> reprogram<00:01:16.610> the

to really kind of reprogram the
operation<00:01:17.330> of<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.540> AP<00:01:17.810> use<00:01:18.020> Stephens<00:01:18.770> ability

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
operation of the AP use Stephens ability

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.420 
operation of the AP use Stephens ability
to<00:01:19.400> constantly<00:01:19.820> challenged<00:01:20.510> us<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:21.190> be<00:01:22.190> better

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
to constantly challenged us to be better

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.990 
to constantly challenged us to be better
