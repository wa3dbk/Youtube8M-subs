00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.380 
air in the side and the gas in the other
side<00:03:17.879> and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.319> jet<00:03:19.739> will<00:03:19.950> run<00:03:20.159> up<00:03:20.700> here

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
side and then that jet will run up here

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.369 
side and then that jet will run up here
and<00:03:21.450> I'll<00:03:22.200> have<00:03:22.349> another<00:03:22.590> short<00:03:23.629> short<00:03:24.629> nozzle

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
and I'll have another short short nozzle

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.690 
and I'll have another short short nozzle
so<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.310> loan<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.670> set<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:28.290> whole<00:03:28.500> unit<00:03:28.920> should

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
so the loan is set the whole unit should

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.330 
so the loan is set the whole unit should

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
only sit six inches high so then I can

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.009 
only sit six inches high so then I can
