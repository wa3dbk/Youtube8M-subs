00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.420
 with a suggestion that lucas alves 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 left j.mp tkd and our wall bar 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.270
 friend lucas alves leaves some suggestion 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.890
 the following sentence makes an analysis of the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.410
 nokia lumia 925 almost real number 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.930
 makes an analysis of the nokia lumia 925 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 beauty lucas so let's go to the mood 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.590
 darkness and we will now bring a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.700
 brief review of nokia number 925 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 analysis that we will show next 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 is available in j.mp hit string 003 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.550
 exactly you can check the images 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 and the graphs that we used in this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.840
 Let's go then let's go 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.840
 this is the nokia lumia 925 and this one here 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.480
 it's nokia lumia 921 I made a tap here 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 for you to be very clear 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 specifications are almost the same 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.339
 the main thing of all is it was released in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.220
 May 2013 nokia lumia 1925 and 1926 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.380
 launched in December, not in September 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 2012 sorry for the fault 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 then from September 2012 to May 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 2013 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.920
 we have a very large difference in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 time there soon the nokia lumia 925 is more 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.619
 thinner and lighter than 920 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 but it has the same camera 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 battery even everything 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.799
 Let's continue watching here. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.829
 we still have the two side by side and serve 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:43.530
 925 7 920 then the weight without tui 36 grams 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:48.750
 to 925 against 135 grams 920 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.009
 type is amoled up to 925 against ips 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 lcd of 920 honestly i use the number 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.649
 720 is here in your hand for you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.159
 ips lcd is very good amoled some 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.070
 people feel more alive feel better about 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.380
 colors to look at the device then on the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.050
 practice against the sun 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 good the two for you might be 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.600
 You prefer amoled so 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.770
 It's changed but it's not so incredible so 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.319
 you have to change 920 because they are 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.980
 332 pixels per square inch of 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.800
 density in this apparatus aiesec 13 62 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.780
 pixels per square inch as well 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.940
 that is, his wife was already pixels per 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.270
 inch per square inch but at last 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.819
 are 332 pixels of density in the two 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.000
 this makes no difference in practice. 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.680
 in resolution then internal memory this 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.450
 here really changed 925 he's got 16 16 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.480
 internal memory gigas 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:57.330
 against 32 of the 920 aa vodafone operator 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.590
 sells this contribution of r 925 in the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.510
 32 gigs 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.640
 I'm not inside the cooperator in the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.120
 Brazil that probably does this to live 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.610
 but unfortunately the 32 gb version can 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.140
 only be available as an operator here in 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.480
 brazil also since the international 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.370
 is working so this is the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.079
 main tip then this is it here has a 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.880
 little less storage 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.660
 necessarily be a little bit 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.190
 more 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.100
 this one is more thin this one is 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.880
 more chubby and the battery both are 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.880
 equals 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.970
 basically the same model galera 925 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.769
 a minimum upgrade of 920 personnel 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.410
 said the camera changed to the 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.250
 specifications are the same as opening 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.470
 Focal is the same armadillo because the same people 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.420
 Seriously, and from what I talked to the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.660
 staff is not worth exchanging 920 for 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.329
 925 I just wanted to see what the worst saw and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.019
 everything else is the same thing 920 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.390
 then the front camera is the same 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.250
 the processor or even the video card 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.470
 it's the same it's adriana 225 in both 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.130
 basically the analysis of the new 1925 a 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.680
 a little improved version of the 920 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.690
 because it's thin and light and that's it 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.260
 That's good, so this is the tip to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.510
 you 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.160
 here tables of comparison that I 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.180
 I just used it here for you. 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.040
 mj tip mp-ba tkd 003 just type 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.830
 insurmountable player you will fall 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.290
 on this screen and straight from the gsm arena and you 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.540
 You can even compare the two side by side 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.700
 exactly as it is here then mine 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.650
 Tip for you who are in doubt if 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.140
 should buy 1 925 920 to buy 925 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.300
 if you can but if you have promotion and 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.690
 iguape friday now that happened in 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.570
 1920 fell a lot of price so do not have 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.510
 because you bought 925 in that case 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.340
 but if you can buy 225 is thinner 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.010
 and lighter newer 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.860
 anyway this is what the staff is just a 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.250
 suggestion of j.mp moral bar tkd of 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.720
 our friend who let lucas alves

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.210
 it's just you, the j.mp bar tkd 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.490
