included<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> next<00:01:32.820> title<00:01:33.210> update<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
included in the next title update on the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.780 
included in the next title update on the
consoles<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> redstone<00:01:35.009> update<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
consoles is the redstone update and the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.969 
consoles is the redstone update and the
redstone<00:01:36.210> updates<00:01:36.720> brought<00:01:37.200> things<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
redstone updates brought things like the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.399 
redstone updates brought things like the
redstone<00:01:38.520> comparator<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.659> hopper<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
redstone comparator the hopper the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
redstone comparator the hopper the
dropper<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.159> daylight<00:01:41.520> sensor<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
dropper the daylight sensor of the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
dropper the daylight sensor of the
trapped<00:01:42.600> chest<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.380> weighted<00:01:43.799> pressure

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
trapped chest the weighted pressure

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.850 
trapped chest the weighted pressure
plate<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.180> block<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.689> redstone<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.530> think

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
plate and the block of redstone I think

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.310 
plate and the block of redstone I think
those<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> main<00:01:47.549> things<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.210> mention<00:01:48.750> but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
those are the main things to mention but

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.899 
those are the main things to mention but
you<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.130> full<00:01:50.399> redstone

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you know these are really full redstone

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
you know these are really full redstone
people<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.420> how<00:01:51.630> many<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.079> guys<00:01:52.259> probably

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
people and how many of you guys probably

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
people and how many of you guys probably
use<00:01:52.950> redstone<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.880> I'll<00:01:53.970> quickly<00:01:54.240> overview

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
use redstone so I'll quickly overview

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.410 
use redstone so I'll quickly overview
them<00:01:55.290> anyway<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.009> redstone<00:01:56.460> comparator<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
them anyway the redstone comparator is a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
them anyway the redstone comparator is a
lot<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.380> redstone<00:01:58.829> repeater<00:01:59.280> but

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
lot like the redstone repeater but

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.160 
lot like the redstone repeater but
that's<00:02:00.090> about<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that's about all I know about the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
that's about all I know about the
comparator<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.890> something<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.430> with

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
comparator it's something to do with

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.270 
comparator it's something to do with
signal<00:02:03.210> strength<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.869> inputs<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> outputs

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
signal strength or inputs and outputs

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.590 
signal strength or inputs and outputs
but<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> get

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
but you know I really don't want to get

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.180 
but you know I really don't want to get
into<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.530> no<00:02:07.680> idea<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
into that I actually have no idea the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
into that I actually have no idea the
next<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> hopper<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.899> dropper

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
next one is the hopper and the dropper

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
next one is the hopper and the dropper
the<00:02:10.500> hot<00:02:10.709> part<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.129> kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.120> funnel

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the hot part is kind of like a funnel

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.160 
the hot part is kind of like a funnel
that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.170 
that
pick<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.560> loose<00:02:13.920> items<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.700> put<00:02:14.849> them<00:02:15.030> into

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
pick up loose items and put them into

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.930 
pick up loose items and put them into
things<00:02:15.480> such<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.780> chests<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:16.709> furnaces<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.790> for

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
things such as chests or furnaces so for

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.760 
things such as chests or furnaces so for
example<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.450> could<00:02:18.599> just<00:02:18.780> throw<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> hot<00:02:19.590> pot

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
example you could just throw a hot pot

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.830 
example you could just throw a hot pot
on<00:02:19.950> top<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.310> chest<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.819> then<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.510> throw

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
on top of a chest and then just throw

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930 
on top of a chest and then just throw
all<00:02:22.080> your<00:02:22.110> items<00:02:22.680> into<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.220> hopper<00:02:23.400> loosely

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
all your items into the hopper loosely

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.729 
all your items into the hopper loosely
and<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> will<00:02:24.420> transfer<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.020> into<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.440> chest

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
and it will transfer it into the chest

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.740 
and it will transfer it into the chest
actually<00:02:26.280> really<00:02:26.670> cool<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.180> next<00:02:27.330> thing<00:02:27.599> is

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
actually really cool the next thing is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.020 
actually really cool the next thing is
the<00:02:27.989> dropper<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.650> dropper<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.790> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the dropper the dropper is like a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.390 
the dropper the dropper is like a
dispenser<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.110> instead<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.650> dispensing<00:02:32.280> them

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
dispenser but instead of dispensing them

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.190 
dispenser but instead of dispensing them
it<00:02:32.640> drops<00:02:33.030> them<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.810> about<00:02:33.989> as

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
it drops them and that is about as

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
it drops them and that is about as
simple<00:02:34.380> as<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> gets<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.190> dispenser<00:02:35.850> if<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
simple as it gets so dispenser if you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970 
simple as it gets so dispenser if you
put<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> bucket<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.840> water<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.380> there<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.800> will

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
put a bucket of water in there it will

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.160 
put a bucket of water in there it will
pour<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> water<00:02:38.640> out<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> dropper<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.989> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
pour the water out but a dropper if you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.690 
pour the water out but a dropper if you
put<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.350> bucket<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.800> water<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.580> will

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
put a bucket of water in there it will

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.610 
put a bucket of water in there it will
drop<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.209> bucket<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.599> water<00:02:42.810> back<00:02:43.140> out<00:02:43.319> rather

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
drop the bucket of water back out rather

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.620 
drop the bucket of water back out rather
than<00:02:43.890> place<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.430> water<00:02:44.730> block<00:02:45.120> same<00:02:45.420> goes<00:02:45.600> for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
than place a water block same goes for

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.750 
than place a water block same goes for
arrows<00:02:46.170> rather<00:02:46.620> than<00:02:46.860> shooting<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> arrows

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
arrows rather than shooting the arrows

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.509 
arrows rather than shooting the arrows
the<00:02:48.150> redstone<00:02:48.780> dropper<00:02:49.319> will<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.950> drop<00:02:50.250> an

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
the redstone dropper will just drop an

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.190 
the redstone dropper will just drop an
arrow<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.209> yeah<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> get<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> point<00:02:51.810> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
arrow so yeah you get the point the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.840 
arrow so yeah you get the point the
daylight<00:02:52.560> sensor<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.190> really<00:02:53.519> shouldn't<00:02:53.790> have

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
daylight sensor I really shouldn't have

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.309 
daylight sensor I really shouldn't have
to<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.150> over<00:02:54.390> what<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.569> means<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.230> basically

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
to go over what that means it basically

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.440 
to go over what that means it basically
sends<00:02:55.890> out<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> redstone<00:02:56.519> signal<00:02:56.790> whenever<00:02:57.269> it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
sends out a redstone signal whenever it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.080 
sends out a redstone signal whenever it
is<00:02:57.480> nighttime<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.560> good<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.090> redstone

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
is nighttime so that's good for redstone

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.059 
is nighttime so that's good for redstone
lamps<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.720> other<00:03:01.140> things<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.920> might

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
lamps and other things that you might

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.670 
lamps and other things that you might
want<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.340> do<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.030> trapped<00:03:03.330> chest<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:04.080> like<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
want to do the trapped chest is like a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.559 
want to do the trapped chest is like a
normal<00:03:05.100> chest<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.730> time<00:03:05.940> when<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.209> open

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
normal chest but this time when you open

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.449 
normal chest but this time when you open
the<00:03:06.690> chest<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:07.170> sends<00:03:07.470> out<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> redstone<00:03:08.220> signal

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the chest it sends out a redstone signal

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.370 
the chest it sends out a redstone signal
so<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:08.940> means<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.540> can<00:03:09.690> booby<00:03:09.989> trap<00:03:10.200> it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
so this means that you can booby trap it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.259 
so this means that you can booby trap it
so<00:03:10.560> whenever<00:03:10.769> opens<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.459> your<00:03:11.670> chest<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.239> your

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
so whenever opens up your chest or your

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.030 
so whenever opens up your chest or your
trapped<00:03:12.660> chest<00:03:13.080> then<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.500> will<00:03:13.590> send<00:03:13.830> out<00:03:13.980> a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
trapped chest then it will send out a

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.680 
trapped chest then it will send out a
signal<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.730> then<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:15.060> wire<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.420> up<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
signal and then you can wire it up to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.530 
signal and then you can wire it up to
some<00:03:16.069> extent<00:03:17.069> EE<00:03:17.250> or<00:03:17.459> something<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.090> soon<00:03:18.420> as<00:03:18.480> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
some extent EE or something so soon as I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.690 
some extent EE or something so soon as I
open<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.870> chest<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.320> TNT<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.829> activated<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
open the chest the TNT is activated the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.699 
open the chest the TNT is activated the
waited<00:03:21.090> pressure<00:03:21.420> plate<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.989> like<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> normal

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
waited pressure plate is like a normal

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.349 
waited pressure plate is like a normal
pressure<00:03:22.920> plate<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.579> there<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:23.850> two<00:03:24.060> types

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
pressure plate but there are two types

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.360 
pressure plate but there are two types
there<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.350> heavy<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> light

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
there is the heavy and the light

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.400 
there is the heavy and the light
weighted<00:03:26.970> pressure<00:03:27.239> plate<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.049> think<00:03:28.290> it's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
weighted pressure plate and I think it's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.410 
weighted pressure plate and I think it's
something<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.950> do<00:03:29.070> with<00:03:29.100> signal<00:03:29.640> strength<00:03:30.090> but

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
something to do with signal strength but

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.240 
something to do with signal strength but
basically<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.260> think<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.799> higher<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
basically I think it's the higher the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.130 
basically I think it's the higher the
signal<00:03:32.609> strength<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.510> things<00:03:33.930> you'll

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
signal strength the more things you'll

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.720 
signal strength the more things you'll
have<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.440> put<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.980> pressure<00:03:35.160> plate<00:03:35.340> for<00:03:35.640> it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
have to put on the pressure plate for it

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.849 
have to put on the pressure plate for it
to<00:03:35.790> be<00:03:35.910> activated<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.630> that's<00:03:37.170> very<00:03:37.410> good<00:03:37.590> for

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
to be activated so that's very good for

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.800 
to be activated so that's very good for
map<00:03:38.130> makers<00:03:38.640> but<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> know<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.420> casual

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
map makers but you know the casual

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.420 
map makers but you know the casual
player<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.290> me<00:03:40.530> who<00:03:40.709> doesn't<00:03:40.890> really<00:03:41.190> like

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
player like me who doesn't really like

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.009 
player like me who doesn't really like
redstone<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.299> guys<00:03:42.450> will<00:03:42.600> probably<00:03:42.690> just

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
redstone you guys will probably just

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.390 
redstone you guys will probably just
stay<00:03:43.230> away<00:03:43.410> from<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.920> lastly<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
stay away from it and lastly the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.280 
stay away from it and lastly the
redstone<00:03:44.790> block<00:03:45.090> everyone<00:03:45.540> can<00:03:45.989> kind<00:03:46.230> of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
redstone block everyone can kind of

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.900 
redstone block everyone can kind of
figure<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:46.859> out<00:03:46.890> it's<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> block<00:03:47.700> of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
figure this one out it's just a block of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.090 
figure this one out it's just a block of
redstone<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.750> takes<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.079> nine<00:03:49.350> redstone<00:03:49.920> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
redstone it takes up nine redstone to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.289 
redstone it takes up nine redstone to
make<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.250> single<00:03:50.519> block<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.970> that's<00:03:51.090> really

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
make a single block and that's really

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.610 
make a single block and that's really
good<00:03:51.510> for<00:03:51.690> storing<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.230> your<00:03:52.380> chest

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
good for storing it in your chest

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.710 
good for storing it in your chest
because<00:03:52.890> I<00:03:53.100> know<00:03:53.250> we<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.269> loads<00:03:54.600> of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
because I know we all have loads of

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.720 
because I know we all have loads of
redstone<00:03:55.049> in<00:03:55.320> our<00:03:55.410> chests<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.370> really

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
redstone in our chests and we really

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.220 
redstone in our chests and we really
don't<00:03:56.850> have<00:03:57.120> much<00:03:57.299> use<00:03:57.329> for<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.780> at<00:03:57.930> all<00:03:58.019> ask

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
don't have much use for it at all ask

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.630 
don't have much use for it at all ask
guys<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.650> don't<00:03:58.799> use<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.280> yeah<00:03:59.459> that

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
guys that don't use it so yeah that

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.039 
guys that don't use it so yeah that
they're<00:03:59.940> all<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.180> main<00:04:00.359> things<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
they're all the main things in the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.280 
they're all the main things in the
redstone<00:04:01.500> update<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.130> lastly<00:04:02.810> 1.6.4<00:04:03.810> will

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
redstone update and lastly 1.6.4 will

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.740 
redstone update and lastly 1.6.4 will
include<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.980> horse<00:04:05.310> update<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.239> everyone

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
include the horse update that everyone

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.479 
include the horse update that everyone
knows<00:04:07.019> about<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.980> pretty<00:04:08.100> much<00:04:08.220> been

knows about so it's pretty much been

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.400 
knows about so it's pretty much been
confirmed<00:04:08.850> by<00:04:09.030> 4j<00:04:09.420> Studios<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:10.019> they<00:04:10.170> will

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
confirmed by 4j Studios that they will

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.410 
confirmed by 4j Studios that they will
include<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:11.040> update<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.180> horse

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
include this update and in the horse

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.809 
include this update and in the horse
update<00:04:12.930> they<00:04:13.170> include<00:04:13.560> obviously<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.549> horse

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
update they include obviously the horse

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.789 
update they include obviously the horse
but<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:15.510> know<00:04:15.630> with<00:04:15.840> horses<00:04:16.169> there<00:04:16.530> are<00:04:16.620> also

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
but you know with horses there are also

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.610 
but you know with horses there are also
donkeys<00:04:17.760> or<00:04:18.000> mules<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.660> there<00:04:19.410> are<00:04:19.500> also

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
donkeys or mules and there are also

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.370 
donkeys or mules and there are also
leads<00:04:20.160> or<00:04:20.549> lassos<00:04:21.479> if<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.870> want<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.080> call<00:04:22.229> them

leads or lassos if you want to call them

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
leads or lassos if you want to call them
that's<00:04:22.860> what<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.099> use<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.490> control<00:04:23.700> your

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
that's what you use to control your

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.370 
that's what you use to control your
horse<00:04:24.300> or<00:04:24.570> tie<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.409> fence<00:04:25.710> post

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
horse or tie it to a fence post

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.350 
horse or tie it to a fence post
also<00:04:26.620> brings<00:04:26.860> coal<00:04:27.250> blocks<00:04:27.730> which<00:04:28.030> don't

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
also brings coal blocks which don't

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.790 
also brings coal blocks which don't
really<00:04:28.480> know<00:04:28.690> how<00:04:28.870> that's<00:04:29.170> anything<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.650> do

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
really know how that's anything to do

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.590 
really know how that's anything to do
with<00:04:29.830> horses<00:04:30.190> but<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.580> brings<00:04:30.760> blocks<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.330> coal

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
with horses but it brings blocks of coal

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.180 
with horses but it brings blocks of coal
where<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.080> takes<00:04:32.290> nine<00:04:32.560> coal<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.010> make<00:04:33.130> a

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
where it takes nine coal to make a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.650 
where it takes nine coal to make a
single<00:04:33.430> block<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.760> lot<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.240> redstone

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
single block a lot like the redstone

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.350 
single block a lot like the redstone
block<00:04:34.900> also<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:35.530> hay<00:04:36.040> bells<00:04:36.340> are<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
block also I think hay bells are in it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.130 
block also I think hay bells are in it
as<00:04:37.510> well

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
as well

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.440 
as well
horse<00:04:38.380> armor<00:04:38.740> which<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.850> know<00:04:39.970> armor<00:04:40.360> that

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
horse armor which is you know armor that

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.370 
horse armor which is you know armor that
you<00:04:40.510> place<00:04:40.750> on<00:04:40.900> your<00:04:41.050> horse

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
you place on your horse

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.680 
you place on your horse
I<00:04:41.530> think<00:04:41.830> there's<00:04:42.010> gold<00:04:42.310> iron<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.240> diamonds

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
I think there's gold iron and diamonds

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.810 
I think there's gold iron and diamonds
not<00:04:44.080> sure<00:04:44.290> about<00:04:44.410> leather<00:04:44.830> but<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.400> might<00:04:45.610> be

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
not sure about leather but it might be

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.410 
not sure about leather but it might be
and<00:04:46.200> nametags<00:04:47.200> as<00:04:47.500> well<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.190> think<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:49.000> don't

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
and nametags as well I think I don't

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.180 
and nametags as well I think I don't
think<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.720> can<00:04:49.870> craft<00:04:50.200> nametags<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.010> think

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
think you can craft nametags I think

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.100 
think you can craft nametags I think
they<00:04:51.280> have<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.490> be<00:04:51.520> found<00:04:51.910> in<00:04:52.120> loot<00:04:52.360> chests<00:04:52.930> in

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
they have to be found in loot chests in

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.410 
they have to be found in loot chests in
dungeons<00:04:53.920> and<00:04:54.130> stuff<00:04:54.400> basically<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.150> attach

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
dungeons and stuff basically you attach

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.570 
dungeons and stuff basically you attach
a<00:04:55.510> nametag<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:56.230> any<00:04:56.560> animal<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.250> could<00:04:57.400> be<00:04:57.550> a

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
a nametag to any animal it could be a

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.610 
a nametag to any animal it could be a
horse<00:04:57.850> appearing<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.420> cow<00:04:58.630> anything<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.440> then

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
horse appearing a cow anything and then

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.230 
horse appearing a cow anything and then
you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.860> type<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.310> what<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.550> want<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.760> call<00:05:01.030> it

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
you can type in what you want to call it

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.970 
you can type in what you want to call it
and<00:05:01.390> then<00:05:01.480> every<00:05:01.780> time<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.320> see<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.560> horse

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
and then every time you see that horse

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.610 
and then every time you see that horse
it'll<00:05:03.460> have<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.760> name<00:05:03.970> above<00:05:04.420> it<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:04.810> also<00:05:05.290> I

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
it'll have the name above it and also I

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.370 
it'll have the name above it and also I
think<00:05:06.250> there<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.790> going<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.180> be<00:05:07.270> hardened<00:05:07.990> clay

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
think there is going to be hardened clay

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.440 
think there is going to be hardened clay
which<00:05:08.950> is<00:05:09.070> basically<00:05:09.430> clay<00:05:09.850> but<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.210> can<00:05:10.330> be

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
which is basically clay but it can be

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.630 
which is basically clay but it can be
dyed<00:05:10.720> in<00:05:11.080> two<00:05:11.290> different<00:05:11.860> colors<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.430> then

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
dyed in two different colors and then

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.760 
dyed in two different colors and then
you<00:05:12.670> can<00:05:12.940> make<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.240> stained<00:05:13.720> clay<00:05:14.170> as<00:05:14.320> well<00:05:14.560> so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
you can make a stained clay as well so

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.350 
you can make a stained clay as well so
that's<00:05:14.890> really<00:05:15.010> cool<00:05:15.490> it's<00:05:15.730> basically<00:05:16.120> like

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
that's really cool it's basically like

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.690 
that's really cool it's basically like
colored<00:05:16.750> wool<00:05:17.020> but<00:05:17.290> it<00:05:17.410> can't<00:05:17.710> burn<00:05:18.070> it

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
colored wool but it can't burn it

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.190 
colored wool but it can't burn it
doesn't<00:05:19.060> catch<00:05:19.240> on<00:05:19.360> fire<00:05:19.600> so<00:05:19.900> that's<00:05:19.990> what

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
doesn't catch on fire so that's what

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.900 
doesn't catch on fire so that's what
hardened<00:05:20.590> clay<00:05:20.740> is<00:05:20.860> gonna<00:05:21.130> be<00:05:21.250> used<00:05:21.430> for<00:05:21.700> so

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
hardened clay is gonna be used for so

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.910 
hardened clay is gonna be used for so
yeah<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.060> think<00:05:22.390> they're<00:05:22.600> all<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.080> interesting

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
yeah I think they're all the interesting

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.380 
yeah I think they're all the interesting
things<00:05:24.190> that<00:05:24.310> are<00:05:24.430> going<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.700> be<00:05:24.820> added<00:05:25.150> in<00:05:25.270> the
