00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
link in description below and the reason

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.980 
link in description below and the reason
why<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> say<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:29.910> track<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.390> unique<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
why I say this track is unique is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.620

because<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.769> track<00:00:32.040> consists<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.730> invisible

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because this track consists of invisible

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
because this track consists of invisible
ramps<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.350> sure<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:34.890> any

everything<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.829> fine

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
everything was fine

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
everything was fine
next<00:01:32.610> thing<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.720> ramp<00:01:33.960> over<00:01:34.350> here

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
next thing you know the ramp over here

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.899 
next thing you know the ramp over here
which<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.979> gotta<00:01:35.159> use<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
which you gotta use to go to this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
which you gotta use to go to this
particular<00:01:36.240> checkpoint<00:01:36.869> disappeared<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
particular checkpoint disappeared and it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
particular checkpoint disappeared and it
was<00:01:38.070> invisible<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.729> awful<00:01:39.030> holy<00:01:39.210> shit

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
was invisible it's awful holy shit

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
was invisible it's awful holy shit
that's<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:41.070> freakin<00:01:41.460> awesome<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.970> right

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that's that's freakin awesome all right

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
that's that's freakin awesome all right
and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.460> tube

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and then you got to go down to the tube

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.480 
and then you got to go down to the tube
station<00:01:44.930> through<00:01:45.930> these<00:01:46.110> steps<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.310> sort

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
station through these steps and you sort

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
station through these steps and you sort
of<00:01:47.549> forced<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> darkness<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.930> when

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
of forced to go a darkness and then when

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
of forced to go a darkness and then when
you<00:01:49.409> come<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.829> section<00:01:50.310> you'll<00:01:50.909> notice

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you come to this section you'll notice

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.580 
you come to this section you'll notice
there's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> clusterfuck<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.439> then

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there's a lot of clusterfuck but then

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
there's a lot of clusterfuck but then
there's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> way<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> execute<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
there's a way to execute this if you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.940 
there's a way to execute this if you
know<00:01:54.689> how<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> you've<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> go<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
know how to do it you've got to go to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770 
know how to do it you've got to go to
the<00:01:56.189> second<00:01:56.520> platform<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.420> did

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the second platform bit which I just did

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.569 
the second platform bit which I just did
unfortunate<00:01:58.770> car<00:01:58.920> was<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> way<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
unfortunate car was in the way of the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
unfortunate car was in the way of the
barriers<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.719> fully<00:02:00.990> accelerate<00:02:01.500> once

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
barriers but you fully accelerate once

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
barriers but you fully accelerate once
you've<00:02:01.979> gotten<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> bit<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:03.000> zero

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you've gotten to that bit with zero

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
you've gotten to that bit with zero
obviously<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:04.079> gonna<00:02:04.170> completely<00:02:04.590> stop

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
obviously you're gonna completely stop

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
obviously you're gonna completely stop
on<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.070> bit<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> fully<00:02:06.030> accelerate

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
on that bit when you fully accelerate

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.999 
on that bit when you fully accelerate
you<00:02:06.630> would<00:02:06.719> easily<00:02:06.899> go<00:02:07.200> past<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> barriers

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you would easily go past the barriers

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.550 
you would easily go past the barriers
but<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> car<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.759> sort<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.599> scraping<00:02:10.110> past

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
but the car just sort of scraping past

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.550 
but the car just sort of scraping past
so<00:02:11.430> obviously<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> angle<00:02:12.480> you're<00:02:12.720> from

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so obviously you angle you're from

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
so obviously you angle you're from
upwards<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.760> he<00:02:14.850> fully<00:02:15.030> accelerates<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:15.720> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
upwards when he fully accelerates so you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.840 
upwards when he fully accelerates so you
go<00:02:16.050> past<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.500> barriers<00:02:16.890> which<00:02:17.130> what<00:02:17.760> I'm

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
go past the barriers which what I'm

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.460 
go past the barriers which what I'm
trying<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.090> explain<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> lot<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.290> people

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
trying to explain so a lot of people

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
trying to explain so a lot of people
what<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> lot<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.070> people's<00:02:20.250> logic<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.880> know

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
what a lot of people's logic is you know

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.150 
what a lot of people's logic is you know
just<00:02:21.420> fully<00:02:21.720> accelerated<00:02:22.110> from<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.710> first

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
just fully accelerated from the first

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.210 
just fully accelerated from the first
platform<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:24.270> go<00:02:24.450> at<00:02:25.110> such<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> weight<00:02:25.740> angle

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
platform to go at such a weight angle

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.790 
platform to go at such a weight angle
when<00:02:26.340> your<00:02:26.520> front<00:02:26.820> bumpers<00:02:27.210> dipping<00:02:27.540> down

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
when your front bumpers dipping down

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.990 
when your front bumpers dipping down
then<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:28.980> screwed<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.760> won't<00:02:29.910> be

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
then it's screwed because you won't be

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.430 
then it's screwed because you won't be
able<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.240> go<00:02:30.330> past<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> batteries<00:02:30.990> so<00:02:31.260> that's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
able to go past the batteries so that's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840 
able to go past the batteries so that's
an<00:02:31.530> interesting<00:02:31.770> part<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> track<00:02:32.640> where

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
an interesting part of the track where

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.460 
an interesting part of the track where
we'll<00:02:33.450> require<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:33.959> bit<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.350> know<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
we'll require a little bit you know a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.710 
we'll require a little bit you know a
little<00:02:34.530> bit<00:02:34.740> from<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.480> which<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
little bit from you which is the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420 
little bit from you which is the
difficulty<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.530> race<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.280> race

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
difficulty of this race but the race

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
difficulty of this race but the race
isn't<00:02:38.640> over<00:02:38.820> yet<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.270> after<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> passed

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
isn't over yet because after you passed

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
isn't over yet because after you passed
it<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.130> know<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.310> obviously<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it bit you know you obviously have to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.730 
it bit you know you obviously have to
use<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.420> other<00:02:42.450> ramp<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.020> go<00:02:43.200> dance<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
use the other ramp to go dance and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.500 
use the other ramp to go dance and
there's<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.580> lot<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.880> variables<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.420> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
there's a lot of variables in that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.060 
there's a lot of variables in that
section<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.230> screw<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:46.860> get

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
section you can screw up you can get

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.220 
section you can screw up you can get
stuck<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.120> once<00:02:48.360> you've<00:02:48.510> eventually<00:02:48.989> passed

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
stuck and once you've eventually passed

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.690 
stuck and once you've eventually passed
the<00:02:49.380> whole<00:02:49.530> part<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.040> know<00:02:50.130> you've<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.580> go

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
the whole part you know you've got to go

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.560 
the whole part you know you've got to go
through<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> tube

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
through the tube

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.900 
through the tube
you<00:02:52.380> know<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.560> underground<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
you know the underground and this is a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.780 
you know the underground and this is a
pretty<00:02:54.120> long<00:02:54.300> underground<00:02:55.020> bit<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.700> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
pretty long underground bit so that you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.820 
pretty long underground bit so that you
can<00:02:56.940> choose<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:57.510> left<00:02:57.720> or<00:02:57.900> right<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> up<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.300 
that and when I was testing the track I
was<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.050> what<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.230> fuck<00:04:37.380> was<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:37.860> they<00:04:38.190> let

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
was like what the fuck was that they let

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.490 
was like what the fuck was that they let
me<00:04:38.370> see<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.000> you'll<00:04:39.960> actually<00:04:40.110> see<00:04:40.470> that

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
me see that and you'll actually see that

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.350 
me see that and you'll actually see that
little<00:04:40.860> cardboard<00:04:41.130> bit<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.850> know<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.210> your

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
little cardboard bit you know if your

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.210 
little cardboard bit you know if your
bumper<00:04:42.690> screwed<00:04:43.020> up<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.380> front<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.160> the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
bumper screwed up in the front and the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.920 
bumper screwed up in the front and the
cars<00:04:44.490> really<00:04:44.790> know<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.030> suspension<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.750> can

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
cars really know it's suspension you can

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.030 
cars really know it's suspension you can
screw<00:04:46.140> up<00:04:46.200> with<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.470> bit<00:04:46.620> as<00:04:46.710> well<00:04:46.890> so<00:04:46.980> you

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
screw up with that bit as well so you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.590 
screw up with that bit as well so you
could<00:04:47.160> avoid<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.490> Cardinal<00:04:47.850> boxes<00:04:48.180> and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
could avoid the Cardinal boxes and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.360 
could avoid the Cardinal boxes and
eventually<00:04:48.990> coming<00:04:49.140> into<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.500> track<00:04:49.770> avoid<00:04:50.280> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
eventually coming into the track avoid a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.620 
eventually coming into the track avoid a
little<00:04:50.460> bit<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.790> boulders<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.390> rocks

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
little bit of the boulders and rocks

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.520 
little bit of the boulders and rocks
there<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.560> bang<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.820> end<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.120> race<00:04:54.350> I'll<00:04:55.350> be

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
there and bang you end the race I'll be

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.080 
there and bang you end the race I'll be
showing<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.920> different<00:04:56.070> point<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.640> views<00:04:56.880> when

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
showing a different point of views when

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.230 
showing a different point of views when
you<00:04:57.180> go<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.390> both<00:04:57.750> different<00:04:58.020> races<00:04:58.710> where<00:04:59.130> you

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
you go to both different races where you

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.620 
you go to both different races where you
enter<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:01.020> underground<00:05:01.440> bit<00:05:02.150> because<00:05:03.150> there

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
enter the underground bit because there

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.690 
enter the underground bit because there
could<00:05:03.810> be<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.200> many<00:05:04.320> different<00:05:04.490> situations<00:05:05.490> so

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
could be so many different situations so

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.420 
could be so many different situations so

right-hand side obviously can't see it
comes<00:05:35.760> invisible<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.390> ramps<00:05:36.750> there<00:05:36.960> where

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
comes invisible the ramps there where

section<00:05:49.460> basically<00:05:50.460> go<00:05:50.640> as<00:05:50.760> slow<00:05:50.880> as<00:05:50.940> possible

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
section basically go as slow as possible

section basically go as slow as possible
in<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.660> first<00:05:51.900> part<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.380> then<00:05:52.650> this<00:05:52.860> bit<00:05:53.040> here

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
in the first part and then this bit here

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.200 
in the first part and then this bit here
you<00:05:53.340> want<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.520> go<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:53.760> second<00:05:54.060> platform

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
you want to go to the second platform

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.520 
you want to go to the second platform
right<00:05:54.510> about<00:05:54.720> there<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.020> then<00:05:55.290> fully

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
right about there and then fully

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.890 
right about there and then fully
accelerate<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.430> order<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.670> execute<00:05:57.210> them<00:05:57.420> we

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
accelerate in order to execute them we

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.660 
accelerate in order to execute them we
need<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.080> go<00:05:58.230> past<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.620> barriers<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.190> of

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
need to go past the barriers and of

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.980 
need to go past the barriers and of
course<00:05:59.880> this<00:06:00.030> ramp<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.420> gotta<00:06:00.600> go<00:06:00.780> out<00:06:00.870> of

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
course this ramp you gotta go out of

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.390 
course this ramp you gotta go out of
particular<00:06:01.380> angles<00:06:01.770> make<00:06:02.070> sure<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.310> don't

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
particular angles make sure you don't

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.100 
particular angles make sure you don't
get<00:06:02.520> stuck<00:06:02.610> because<00:06:02.940> some<00:06:03.150> people<00:06:03.450> do<00:06:03.930> end<00:06:04.050> up

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
get stuck because some people do end up

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.140 
get stuck because some people do end up
getting<00:06:04.380> stuck<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.890> really<00:06:05.280> awkward<00:06:05.460> angle<00:06:05.970> and

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
getting stuck a really awkward angle and

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.420 
getting stuck a really awkward angle and
it's<00:06:06.690> pretty<00:06:06.870> hard<00:06:07.050> to<00:06:07.140> recover<00:06:07.500> anyway<00:06:08.250> this

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
it's pretty hard to recover anyway this

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.820 
it's pretty hard to recover anyway this
is<00:06:08.610> a<00:06:08.640> another<00:06:09.420> attempt<00:06:09.900> with<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.530> car<00:06:10.740> in

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
is a another attempt with the car in

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.200 
is a another attempt with the car in
front<00:06:10.950> of<00:06:11.130> me<00:06:11.220> as<00:06:11.340> we're<00:06:11.460> competing<00:06:11.760> right<00:06:12.030> now

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
front of me as we're competing right now

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.540 
front of me as we're competing right now
so<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.260> guy<00:06:13.380> does<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.680> perfectly<00:06:14.070> like<00:06:14.340> that

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
so this guy does it perfectly like that

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.460 
so this guy does it perfectly like that
so<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.270> got<00:06:15.390> to<00:06:15.480> do<00:06:15.570> it<00:06:15.690> most<00:06:15.990> people<00:06:16.200> wanna<00:06:16.350> do

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
so you got to do it most people wanna do

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.740 
so you got to do it most people wanna do
it<00:06:16.560> for<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.710> first<00:06:16.920> time<00:06:17.130> I<00:06:17.370> will<00:06:18.090> show<00:06:18.300> you<00:06:18.360> 95

it for the first time I will show you 95

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.170 
it for the first time I will show you 95
percent<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.050> you<00:06:19.140> will<00:06:19.380> fail<00:06:19.650> if<00:06:20.490> you<00:06:20.670> haven't

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
percent of you will fail if you haven't

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.610 
percent of you will fail if you haven't
seen<00:06:21.300> this<00:06:21.360> video<00:06:21.510> or<00:06:21.840> if<00:06:22.140> they<00:06:22.260> haven't<00:06:22.530> seen

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
seen this video or if they haven't seen

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.060 
seen this video or if they haven't seen
this<00:06:22.710> video<00:06:22.830> so<00:06:23.480> you<00:06:24.480> know<00:06:24.570> it's<00:06:24.660> one<00:06:24.780> of<00:06:24.810> those

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
this video so you know it's one of those

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.470 
this video so you know it's one of those
one<00:06:26.070> of<00:06:26.100> those<00:06:26.220> things<00:06:26.550> where<00:06:26.910> he<00:06:26.940> does

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
one of those things where he does

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.550 
one of those things where he does
require<00:06:27.750> a<00:06:27.870> little<00:06:27.960> bit<00:06:28.140> of<00:06:28.200> thinking<00:06:28.350> at

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
require a little bit of thinking at

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.350 
require a little bit of thinking at
first<00:06:28.800> but<00:06:29.040> then<00:06:29.190> once<00:06:29.430> you<00:06:29.580> get<00:06:29.760> used<00:06:29.940> to<00:06:30.060> it

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
first but then once you get used to it

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.810 
first but then once you get used to it
she<00:06:30.840> able<00:06:30.960> to<00:06:31.140> pull<00:06:31.290> off<00:06:31.410> this<00:06:31.620> pretty<00:06:32.580> easily

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
she able to pull off this pretty easily

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.330 
she able to pull off this pretty easily
so<00:06:33.290> as<00:06:34.290> you<00:06:34.350> can<00:06:34.440> see<00:06:34.500> you<00:06:34.710> don't<00:06:34.860> go<00:06:34.980> too<00:06:35.040> far

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
so as you can see you don't go too far

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.710 
so as you can see you don't go too far
otherwise<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:35.820> would<00:06:35.940> hit<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.180> top<00:06:36.360> part<00:06:36.630> of

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
otherwise you would hit the top part of

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.590 
otherwise you would hit the top part of
the<00:06:36.870> entrance<00:06:37.200> and<00:06:37.350> then<00:06:38.250> see<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:39.030> that's

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
the entrance and then see that that's

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.920 
the entrance and then see that that's
the

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
the

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.930 
the
at<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.320> time<00:06:40.560> when<00:06:40.770> people<00:06:40.860> screw<00:06:41.160> up<00:06:41.340> and<00:06:41.610> get

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
at a time when people screw up and get

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.250 
at a time when people screw up and get
stuck<00:06:42.180> that<00:06:42.330> you<00:06:42.419> could<00:06:42.540> take<00:06:42.660> advantage<00:06:42.810> of

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
stuck that you could take advantage of

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.890 
stuck that you could take advantage of
that<00:06:43.410> so<00:06:43.680> it<00:06:43.740> doesn't<00:06:44.100> matter<00:06:44.220> what<00:06:44.639> position

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
that so it doesn't matter what position

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.659 
that so it doesn't matter what position
you're<00:06:45.900> in<00:06:45.960> some<00:06:46.440> people<00:06:46.650> I<00:06:47.010> don't<00:06:47.310> know<00:06:47.460> how

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
think of this track it consists of

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.879 
think of this track it consists of
invisible<00:07:26.520> ramps<00:07:26.910> a<00:07:27.150> lot<00:07:27.720> of<00:07:27.840> a<00:07:28.200> lot<00:07:28.590> of<00:07:28.710> things

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:28.889 
invisible ramps a lot of a lot of things

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.370 
invisible ramps a lot of a lot of things
to<00:07:29.070> do<00:07:29.280> a<00:07:29.310> lot<00:07:29.610> of<00:07:29.669> things<00:07:29.790> to<00:07:29.910> execute<00:07:30.450> so<00:07:30.810> yeah

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
to do a lot of things to execute so yeah

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.219 
to do a lot of things to execute so yeah
I<00:07:31.410> think<00:07:31.650> it's<00:07:32.039> interesting<00:07:32.400> and<00:07:33.229> really

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229 
I think it's interesting and really

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:35.900 
I think it's interesting and really
difficult<00:07:34.680> expects<00:07:35.100> a<00:07:35.190> lot<00:07:35.220> more<00:07:35.490> difficult

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:35.910 
difficult expects a lot more difficult

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.180 
difficult expects a lot more difficult
