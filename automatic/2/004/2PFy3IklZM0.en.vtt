00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello 48 what do you have you left quÃ©bec for the year in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.739
 course 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.329
 esi late ono 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:15.700
 we scarcely dare 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.109
 me daniel merchat 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.920
 okay so the case of your company's assets i'm renting planes 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.379
 joe biden did some small jobs left right but hey I 

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.379
 I'm often on the roads and he told himself a lot of kilometers 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.770
 cost of this post installation 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770
 that's when I won% enormously 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
 first, there are the cultural constraints to see 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 I think everyone will know 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.360
 if I'm full and to refuel 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.190
 how did you get to know him then 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 but that's not all 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.240
 he had talked about it 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.760
 yeah and so where he was a little skeptical at first I'm not a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 little skeptical because for me I knew the records following 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.780
 obwald at the box all that so we can do 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 the cure we tried 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.130
 this one that I believe was converted quoted during the summer it seems to me 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.660
 political agitator 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.880
 So here we are in September 1 so it's 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.090
 three four months 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.530
 the identity of the country of agreement 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 what is its consumption before to install then be consumed between 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.920
 them 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.240
 according to the echo that enters 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.010
 minimum 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.600
 but even if it's martine aubry 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.170
 okay it is today that the consumption to the applicant boyer of the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.480
 quality put ko 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.870
 when you translate without motorcycle 2000 so you went from how much 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.220
 kilometers fought the army around the world 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.590
 I managed on average we go well between them 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 120 and 150 kilometers more often 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.880
 for what is still not bad 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.780
 you went 2,200 or 2,300 km to I went from 320 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.319
 then 320 km between 280 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.510
 the 320 km 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.640
 arcade sense 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.640
 the 450 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.930
 so we have no calculation at crespo strong percentages and not calculator it 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.079
 have to look for them gabon where are they 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.489
 so this site these changes were measured so the full by 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.489
 the increase in autonomy and then you did the calculations 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.959
 on the economic plan 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.399
 electronic gromov at the time summit 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.179
 agreements for the consumer 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.179
 you'll get a lot of data and stop at the site 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.719
 after how long 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.629
 in fact what you found so these changes 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.979
 property of the walls 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.089
 little or no what is good it was necessary to find the exact setting 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.089
 but once the galipette was found 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.319
 the minister so 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.449
 rest every day 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.299
 I find my urine 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.209
 so let's stop business daily 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.830
 the press has not moved 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.880
 and after that move more 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.949
 its imposition what we do here as work 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 thunderstorms more often on the spot automatically must consume more 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.209
 the pq does not fall so 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.789
 musratha 200 km further near in time it brews stable 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:16.249
 for a single day the maximum that I decided on him 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.999
 dan glickman of victory 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.999
 if the maximum I was synonymous with security 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.689
 walter ruegg 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.930
 it's very stable whereas mabri appreciated good faith that had left 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.509
 questionable 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.699
 but what did you taste as difference as to the conduct 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.219
 long so in terms of speed torque power in the curves of the 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.459
 gear ratios to motor skills 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.949
 gold in cases already beautiful I won a discount that I took in 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.949
 first load and I can take them in second 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.519
 what I admire no worse because the engine 7-8 tour 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.729
 we immediately motricity 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.729
 because good account small trucks 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.629
 once charged against 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.879
 movies panic patina 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.879
 the engine was much more 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.979
 she adds that the team is less bright origin 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.479
 which surprised me because 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.389
 so for his victory 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.039
 there is a clear difference 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.019
 in total for the same conduct by would bring more the same way 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.229
 in e to the pedal and difference 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.270
 you would say that this sausage of these powers this extra torque in 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.990
 percentage of stim auriacombe 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 see the subject of libya 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.930
 did you see that at the box reports level so 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.349
 that translates how 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.419
 well you said you were gaining speed in the ribs but what he 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:43.610
 must 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.229
 we look back we make sense 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.319
 know how old I can get to the point where 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.680
 on these words and the evils 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.860
 I want downgraded 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.159
 good there I can keep the same speed are not met look v8 4 0 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.330
 he takes what 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 he dreads colombo 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.939
 did you notice any disadvantages and if so which ones 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.430
 see the disadvantages 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.440
 he combined in the system we know that we must have the time to 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.770
 Spain is almost reached 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.370
 like me so I speak for me because it was the first time we had 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.110
 tried 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.909
 generous 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.349
 he fits and all that 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.349
 jeans or accompanying 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.770
 do you have calculate how much you are getting fuel per month 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.759
 in euroleague 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.580
 even the red triangle 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.580
 in the office it's a bit 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.279
 peugeot is already winning 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.719
 its range already a little clear 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.719
 on the sly for me it was 400 m 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.580
 the sound that counts only one 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.909
 quickmail its segment 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.080
 touati km 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.249
 400 years 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:01.490
 by winning 1 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.930
 gaza and what is rare 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.570
 so you can go on holiday at the end of the year away 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.059
 for the city and the southern caf 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.059
 okay so what would you recommend to them to run away 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.849
 of his problem I recommend 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.619
 and percent and in addition to that 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.619
 on the staff week alone 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:22.619
 do not talk to you about themselves 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:24.860
 he agreed we will come back to the interviews 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.379
 I go then for the car and we will also cast 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.569
 so at the same time to finish what you could so summarize 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:34.120
 the man 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.590
 for a few words the rando three sentences for your experience with for 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.270
 each 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.059
 in two three phases 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:44.249
 it's something that is this cable 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:45.800
 so there are no eight engines 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.369
 on the contrary 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:51.369
 how much of the consumption 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.729
 the company manager is the meeting that won 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.729
 it is not part of it 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:08.129
 the six people 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.689
 both men because 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.689
 it was not always easy to find 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.599
 for that there is no problem 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:18.999
 but overall I am very satisfied 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.999
 finally it's not in his studio am very satisfied 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.050
 the trio all in all it's true we're a little scared at first 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.349
 but when we see what is going on 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.699
 pielbags is no reason to be scared it's raining a lot of investments that 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.819
 goes out on the stock market as fast this is exactly 

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:40.619
 very well thank you for this welcome this interview is and modeling and lady of 

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:41.349
 rangoon thank you m
