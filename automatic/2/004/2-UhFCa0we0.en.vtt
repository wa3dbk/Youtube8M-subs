00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello today we will learn a 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 bossa nova rhythm which is rather nice to 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.560
 to play and who will make you work 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.420
 your independence to play it I you 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.100
 proposes three exercises, the first of which 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.489
 which will allow you to assimilate the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.749
 bossa nova pattern which is the on 1 and 2 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.420
 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.050
 and 3 and 4 and one and two and three and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.329
 four 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.300
 and that's how you can 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.069
 find out there are two measures three 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.079
 notes in the first measure of notes 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.510
 in the second measure these two measures 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.710
 are interchangeable and in the case where 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.409
 there are three notes of the first measure 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.510
 we're talking about the pattern 3 2 otherwise the pattern 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.819
 3 for the first exercise 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.889
 we will play the pattern on the hi-hat 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:04.180
 and the cash register in lacrosse tic 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.619
 that is, instead of hitting on 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.390
 the skin of the snare one goes 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.189
 return his wand and we will hit 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.460
 on the circle of the snare go 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.460
 Let's go 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.740
 for the exercise of one simply goes 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 resume the previous rhythm and add 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.040
 the bass drum then you will see 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.420
 it's not necessarily obvious, so I tell you 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:02:08.220
 recommend to work it very 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:02:09.209
 slowly does the exercise that you 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.190
 come to realize is not that a 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.540
 exercise is a rhythm in its own right 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.370
 which is played as is in pieces 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.019
 of bossa nova but we're going to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.160
 spice up a bit instead of playing them 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.290
 eighth notes on the Charleston 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.810
 we will play them on the wrinkle and we will 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 introduce the hi-hat play foot 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.040
 so for the third exercise 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 we will only focus on the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.610
 ride the bass drum and hi-hat 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.610
 footwork that's what it gives 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.230
 to get the final rhythm you 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.120
 resume the previous exercise and you 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.350
 add the bossa nova pattern that you 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.070
 have seen in the first exercise 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.070
 here we go 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.470
 as I said at the beginning of the video 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180
 can also play it in 2 3 that's at 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.440
 say with the two notes on the first 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:44.489
 measure rather than the second 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:45.780
 that's what it gives it's all 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.400
 for today I hope you go 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.049
 have fun with this bossa rhythm 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.010
 nova and I'll see you soon on 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.010
