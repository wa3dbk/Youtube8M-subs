00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.320
 hello girls here I come with a new 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.809
 video this time I'm going to make a design 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.600
 for the contest of Facebook for 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.780
 in cool life that organized and well she 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.779
 ask for a design in shades of pink green blue 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.850
 and black it does not matter how it is but 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.560
 it has to have those colors so 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.260
 As you can see here I have my nail ready 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.149
 with a crystal acrylic base 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.570
 I'm waiting and I do not want to paste here 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.129
 my dual ways because I want to see if 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.339
 I find a wooden handle or if I 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.920
 they get it worth it so then from 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.440
 moment I'm working like this with the base 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.170
 acrylic underneath my base 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.220
 of the nail is worth nothing girls I'm going to 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.530
 start with the design voucher 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.160
 what I'm going to do is start putting 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.540
 a capita of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.540
 acrylic clear 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.840
 at the base of the dual 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.710
 as we always assume that the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.520
 well-prepared natural nail pampered 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 dehydrated 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.609
 and disinfected of anything goes then 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.609
 we started by putting a very thin layer 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.290
 acrylic glass 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.220
 I'm going to make a stiletto this time I'm going to 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 make the design in stiletto 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.790
 so while I put the base I'm going 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.790
 doing formica 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.400
 to go giving a form and if they let me 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.320
 you know that stilettos can be 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.280
 very very in peak shape very marked 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.280
 or a little less 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.440
 I'm already going to taste 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.250
 ok I have my acrylic capita 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.250
 clear 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.080
 and I'm going to let it dry for a few seconds 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.980
 posts you set already dried so what 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.980
 I will do now is 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.580
 A marker 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:41.280
 for all surfaces 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.280
 ok i'm going to make some designs in color 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.159
 to see that if you can see well 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.370
 I'm going to let it dry a little bit now 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 that does not run the painting is worth and now 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.680
 come back after I come and I'm going to catch 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 first 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.820
 the colored acrylic color filters 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.840
 I will leave them indistinctly 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.220
 on the nail only the dual 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.220
 I'm going to start over 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.600
 Ok now I'm going to let you dry 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.720
 very tiny seconds very little very 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 bit 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.840
 anne look at it in a little way 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.560
 fix we have and file we have a work 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.560
 problem is worth 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.860
 ok and I'm going to put a little bit more 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.160
 acrylic clear very little here here 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.160
 OK 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.880
 and we will cooperate with our crime 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.609
 and we wait a few seconds more girls 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.190
 You will forgive me because you believed me 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.389
 he was recording and good as he 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.750
 has been removing what has been left 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:29.400
 here on the outside 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.900
 and what underneath the nail has been tested 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.460
 a little bit what I'm going to do now is 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.460
 Give it a little bit of strength 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.350
 to tip 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.120
 Reinforces it a little with acrylic 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.120
 crystal 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
 Be very careful not to get involved 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.380
 too much under the finger because 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.280
 if not then that would be very ugly when 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.280
 the nail appeared 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.150
 I already wait a little bit to dry the 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.150
 acrylic before 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.020
 Well, I think it has dried up then 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.530
 I'm going to apply the place 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.509
 I have this, I'm going to do it 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.210
 as always I will encourage what is the 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.940
 cuticle area and the tips of the 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.940
 edges is worth once that lime 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.360
 go as always because I'm going to take a 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.319
 cellulose plant and I will clean the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.319
 excess of dust 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.230
 above and below where final 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.350
 and well nothing is already this would be the 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.360
 my finished design I'm going to put it now 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.320
 a little bit of brightness above so that 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.320
 look a little more 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.880
 and I hope you like it a lot 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.980
