bike speed wise it's not gonna set you
on<00:01:32.439> fire<00:01:32.500> but<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.039> goes<00:01:33.369> out<00:01:33.640> enough<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.479> pace

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
on fire but it goes out enough of a pace

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.389 
on fire but it goes out enough of a pace
you<00:01:34.930> can<00:01:35.049> get<00:01:35.229> out<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.560> around<00:01:35.619> traffic<00:01:36.039> and

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
you can get out and around traffic and

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.819 
you can get out and around traffic and
out<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.640> way<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.000> not<00:01:37.240> be<00:01:37.680> worried<00:01:38.680> about

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
out of the way and not be worried about

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.679 
out of the way and not be worried about
being<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:39.939> traffic<00:01:40.289> it'll<00:01:41.289> do<00:01:42.180> 7075<00:01:43.180> really

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
being in traffic it'll do 7075 really

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.679 
being in traffic it'll do 7075 really
easily<00:01:44.049> I'm<00:01:47.130> pretty<00:01:48.130> sure<00:01:48.310> they'll<00:01:48.490> do<00:01:48.640> 95<00:01:49.329> if

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
easily I'm pretty sure they'll do 95 if

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.240 
easily I'm pretty sure they'll do 95 if
you<00:01:49.810> push<00:01:50.140> them<00:01:50.320> real<00:01:50.500> hard<00:01:50.770> but<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.009> don't

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
you push them real hard but I don't

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.760 
you push them real hard but I don't
think<00:01:51.520> you'll<00:01:51.700> see<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:51.969> hundred<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.570> them<00:01:52.780> or<00:01:53.200> if

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
think you'll see a hundred on them or if

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.200 
think you'll see a hundred on them or if
you<00:01:53.890> do<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.189> won't<00:01:54.310> be<00:01:54.490> very<00:01:54.640> easy

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
you do it won't be very easy

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.870 
you do it won't be very easy
it's<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.289> 650<00:01:57.240> v-twin<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.829> one<00:02:00.009> has<00:02:00.219> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's a 650 v-twin this one has the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.510 
it's a 650 v-twin this one has the
emissions<00:02:01.390> all<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:02.079> smog<00:02:02.530> crap<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.159> it<00:02:03.310> but<00:02:03.490> I

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
emissions all that smog crap on it but I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.719 
emissions all that smog crap on it but I
think<00:02:03.640> most<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.270> them<00:02:04.390> do<00:02:04.570> now<00:02:05.460> these<00:02:06.460> star

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
think most of them do now these star

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.430 
think most of them do now these star
people<00:02:06.759> have<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.420> correct<00:02:07.630> me<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:07.990> if<00:02:08.289> I'm

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
people have to correct me on that if I'm

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.120 
people have to correct me on that if I'm
wrong<00:02:08.619> but

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130
