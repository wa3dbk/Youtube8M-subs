just fly to the nearest airport land VFR
so<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> make<00:00:12.269> sure<00:00:12.450> everything<00:00:12.840> is

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
so you want to make sure everything is

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.049 
so you want to make sure everything is
working<00:00:13.110> correctly<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.980> reliably<00:00:14.670> before

work properly so when you remove the
pedo<00:00:35.070> cover<00:00:35.430> look<00:00:36.180> closely<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.960> any<00:00:36.989> blockage
