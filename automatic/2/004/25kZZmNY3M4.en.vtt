00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
ground a little earlier that being

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
called the beginning of July but this

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.910 
called the beginning of July but this
year<00:00:27.150> I've<00:00:27.330> left<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.810> later<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
year I've left it later because of the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.400 
year I've left it later because of the
weather<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.789> now<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> am<00:00:30.689> taking<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.230> out

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
weather and and now I am taking it out

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.020 
weather and and now I am taking it out
even<00:00:31.740> though<00:00:31.859> could<00:00:32.309> probably<00:00:32.520> stay<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
even though could probably stay in the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
even though could probably stay in the
ground<00:00:33.149> another<00:00:33.540> week<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.950> more

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
ground another week but we have more

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.979 
ground another week but we have more
rain<00:00:35.399> forecast<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.600> want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> take

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
rain forecast so I don't want to take

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.860 
rain forecast so I don't want to take
the<00:00:37.020> chance<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.129> garlic<00:00:38.489> starting<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> rot

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the chance of the garlic starting to rot

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
the chance of the garlic starting to rot
so<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.860> I've<00:00:40.980> done<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.399> pulled<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.940> out

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so what I've done is I pulled this out

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
so what I've done is I pulled this out
and<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:43.350> gentle<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> garlic

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and I'm very gentle with the garlic

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
and I'm very gentle with the garlic
cloves<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.570> delicate<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
cloves because it's very delicate and it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.229 
cloves because it's very delicate and it
can<00:00:46.590> Bruce<00:00:46.829> quite<00:00:47.280> easy<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:48.090> want

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
can Bruce quite easy so you don't want

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
can Bruce quite easy so you don't want
to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.390> too<00:00:48.600> rough<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:50.039> lightly

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to be too rough with it I just lightly

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
to be too rough with it I just lightly
home<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> roots<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.750> my<00:00:51.899> fingers<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.350> get

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
home the roots with my fingers and get

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
home the roots with my fingers and get
out<00:00:52.890> excess<00:00:53.399> dirt<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.930> lightly

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
out excess dirt and then I just lightly

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
out excess dirt and then I just lightly
rub<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.579> even<00:00:57.000> peel<00:00:57.239> back<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.780> couple<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
rub or even peel back a couple of the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.860 
rub or even peel back a couple of the
skins<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> any<00:00:59.670> excess<00:01:00.329> dirt<00:01:00.629> off<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
skins to get the any excess dirt off the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.619 
skins to get the any excess dirt off the
garlic<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.760> start<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> curing

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
garlic and then I start the curing

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.890 
garlic and then I start the curing
process<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.650> myself<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.360> carport

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
process so for myself I use my carport

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
process so for myself I use my carport
and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.650> take<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> car<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.400> set<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and I just take the car out set up a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.440 
and I just take the car out set up a
table<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> lay<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> garlic<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
of 10 or so and just a little bit more
wrap<00:01:23.460> some<00:01:23.850> wire<00:01:24.090> around<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
wrap some wire around it and then just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
wrap some wire around it and then just
hook<00:01:26.040> wire<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> string<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.930> might

hook wire to a string that you might

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
hook wire to a string that you might
have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> crossover<00:01:28.979> rumor<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.060> could

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
discard your leaves into the compost

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.360 
discard your leaves into the compost
better<00:02:04.390> not<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.930> either<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.680> burn<00:02:05.860> them<00:02:06.100> or<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
better not to either to burn them or to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.210 
better not to either to burn them or to
just<00:02:06.550> put<00:02:06.700> them<00:02:06.820> into<00:02:06.970> your<00:02:07.120> garbage<00:02:08.100> but<00:02:09.100> I've

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
just put them into your garbage but I've

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.630 
just put them into your garbage but I've
cut<00:02:09.459> an<00:02:09.580> escape<00:02:09.970> off<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:12.340> haven't

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
cut an escape off of this if you haven't

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.910 
cut an escape off of this if you haven't
cut<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.150> escapes<00:02:13.540> off<00:02:13.840> if<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
cut your escapes off if you have a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.060 
cut your escapes off if you have a
garlic<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.730> you're<00:02:15.880> drawing<00:02:16.680> would<00:02:17.680> escape

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
garlic that you're drawing would escape

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.540 
garlic that you're drawing would escape
on<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.520> still<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:20.500> dries<00:02:20.830> they're<00:02:21.310> sort<00:02:21.520> of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
on it still as it dries they're sort of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.070 
on it still as it dries they're sort of
almost<00:02:21.760> stilt<00:02:22.209> well<00:02:22.390> they're<00:02:22.510> still<00:02:22.720> growing

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
almost stilt well they're still growing

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.180 
almost stilt well they're still growing
so<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.190> scape<00:02:24.520> might<00:02:25.090> even<00:02:25.270> open<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.260> open

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
so the scape might even open up and open

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.180 
so the scape might even open up and open
to<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.670> seeds<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.600> can<00:02:28.630> do<00:02:28.900> those<00:02:29.190> you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
to all the seeds you can do those you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.590 
to all the seeds you can do those you
know<00:02:30.280> whatever<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.880> want<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.239> can<00:02:31.360> store

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
know whatever you want you can store

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.120 
know whatever you want you can store
them<00:02:31.720> right<00:02:31.930> some<00:02:32.200> people<00:02:32.230> keep<00:02:32.680> them<00:02:32.860> again

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
them right some people keep them again

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.820 
them right some people keep them again
to<00:02:33.580> harvest<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.209> following<00:02:34.540> year<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
to harvest for the following year so it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.380 
to harvest for the following year so it
wouldn't<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> next<00:02:36.790> year<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.030> get<00:02:37.209> them

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
wouldn't be the next year you get them

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.540 
wouldn't be the next year you get them
because<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.720> does<00:02:37.870> take<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> while<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.310> is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
because it does take a while this one is

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.400 
because it does take a while this one is
one<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.209> planted<00:02:40.750> just<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.050> very<00:02:41.260> small

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
one that I planted just a very small

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.220 
one that I planted just a very small
clove<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.550> from<00:02:42.730> last<00:02:43.000> year<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.570> I'll<00:02:44.050> go
