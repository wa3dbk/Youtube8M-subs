to<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.170> gamer<00:00:37.910> is<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.170> can't<00:00:40.500> assume

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to the gamer is this you can't assume

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
to the gamer is this you can't assume
that<00:00:41.190> anything<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.940> comes<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> Infinity

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that anything that comes out of Infinity

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.529 
that anything that comes out of Infinity
Ward<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
Ward is just not going to have that

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.760 
Ward is just not going to have that
magic<00:00:45.539> touch<00:00:46.020> anymore<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> every

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
magic touch anymore and but out of every

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680 
magic touch anymore and but out of every
negative<00:00:52.980> comes<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> positive<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> believe

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
negative comes a positive and I believe

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
negative comes a positive and I believe
the<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.020> positive<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:56.100> come<00:00:56.399> from

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the one positive that will come from

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.869 
the one positive that will come from
this<00:00:56.760> will<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.649> spawn<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.920> new<00:00:59.100> first-person

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
