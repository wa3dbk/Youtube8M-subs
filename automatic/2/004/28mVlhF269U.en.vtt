00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:19.730
 greetings then this video weblog I decided to do it initially because not 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.640
 it seems strange to me 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.900
 and I wanted to do it a long time already to wish a little indexed that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.249
 I wanted to continue with the make up videos really 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.640
 but then I have a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.000
 i don't know i thought somebody might obviously not be interested in a 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.720
 all good and bad - people are registered at the club 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.340
 for market yards that Italian users fincantieri minister of health 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.110
 the first favorite series I always have sex and the city is always me 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.420
 liked 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.430
 but to tell the truth I have recently discovered it, we say that maybe it is good 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.820
 a completely different show above all not doing so much 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.380
 laugh instead not underestimated and then revalued. 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.490
 all the guarana 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.020
 proud verb to be born that in my opinion very beautiful because it does not make me laugh a lot 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.610
 to me that they translate 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.039
 I don't know. Samantha's lines make me laugh too much 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.620
 and then limbo also 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.299
 many people maybe 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.950
 pessano identify horns with the protagonists I do not know what it is 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.939
 I don't know anything so small about your romance 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.520
 I liked it so much first of all because maybe in something 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.110
 meaning second because it makes us die of laughter 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.570
 6oo I don't know it doesn't taste like this fucking I'm this guy the show is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.940
 that make you laugh 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.530
 and in fact many people, even the history of this TV show, was designed specifically for 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.549
 practically this show 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.979
 and I wanted to ask how many of you like because maybe so many 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.069
 people don't like this because they don't understand it maybe because bonanno e 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.119
 pepper best interest the taxman is not the movies and other genres do 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.560

 I'm not pinned cansada accept practically I am very much desires 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.980
 for those who missed it even though I think it's all unlikely so leg by 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.699
 sell even if you go back to the TV series that I always wanted to tell you 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:26.139
 comedy makes the nanny is a TV series probably me when we were keep 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.139
 what is my memory of the 90s perhaps 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:35.319
 they became animated, it made her laugh too much as the tata francesca dressed up 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.039
 laughter that butler if the naive butler can die he has them 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.530
 facts 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.639
 even for that hour that show is engaged 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.279
 It's one of my favorites they're giving it 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.380
 always if they download anyway even in English you can watch la7 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.880
 if you are interested in it, it makes you another world of TV series that I tell you that I don't mention you 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.969
 always also all in the family 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:02.219

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.259
 to laugh 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:07.980
 you don't follow all the writings the bad seasons even I think enough 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.050
 it was also the same as those giving up fox and not on foxlife telefilm 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.280
 that I follow. 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.280
