now<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> basic<00:00:34.770> concept<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.309> pretty<00:00:35.579> simple

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
now the basic concept is pretty simple

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.959 
now the basic concept is pretty simple
you<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.300> rotate<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.989> stick<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.829> hole<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
you just rotate one stick in a hole in

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
you just rotate one stick in a hole in
another<00:00:39.090> stick<00:00:39.890> applying<00:00:40.890> downward<00:00:41.250> pressure

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
another stick applying downward pressure

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
another stick applying downward pressure
and<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.719> combination<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.500> speed<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and that combination of speed and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.060 
and that combination of speed and
pressure<00:00:44.219> creates<00:00:44.820> friction<00:00:46.070> friction

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
pressure creates friction friction

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
pressure creates friction friction
creates<00:00:47.610> heat<00:00:47.730> causing<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> organic

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
creates heat causing the organic

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.310

forming charcoal thus the dust collects
in<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:54.899> mulch<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.860> temperature

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
in a little mulch the temperature

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
in a little mulch the temperature
increases<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.270> friction<00:00:57.480> until

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
increases with more friction until

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.630 
increases with more friction until

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
pile of sawdust is reached and we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
pile of sawdust is reached and we
basically<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.949> spontaneous<00:01:02.520> combustion

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
basically get spontaneous combustion

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.210 
basically get spontaneous combustion

speed up the reaction and by the stage

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
speed up the reaction and by the stage
of<00:01:07.170> stop<00:01:07.380> drilling<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> heat

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
of stop drilling and you use that heat

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.600 
of stop drilling and you use that heat
then<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.960> ignite<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.619> flaming<00:01:10.979> tinder<00:01:11.310> and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
disadvantages for one you ladies always

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.280 
disadvantages for one you ladies always
seem<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.519> way<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.019> even<00:03:22.019> your<00:03:22.140> body

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
seem to be in the way and even your body

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.990 
seem to be in the way and even your body
because<00:03:22.890> your<00:03:23.250> pelvis

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
because your pelvis

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120 
because your pelvis
keep<00:03:24.239> bumping<00:03:24.540> into<00:03:24.780> something<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.830> can't

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
keep bumping into something so you can't

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.580 
keep bumping into something so you can't
get<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> full<00:03:26.610> range<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.060> movement<00:03:27.330> on<00:03:28.320> both

get the full range of movement on both

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.120 
get the full range of movement on both
hands

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
hands

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.890 
hands
in<00:03:29.400> fact<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.820> often<00:03:29.970> sees<00:03:30.120> people<00:03:30.600> doing

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
in fact one often sees people doing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
in fact one often sees people doing
angle<00:03:31.260> method<00:03:31.590> with<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.579> one<00:03:32.730> hand

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
angle method with just the one hand

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.610 
angle method with just the one hand
because<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.510> other<00:03:33.630> ones<00:03:33.840> sort<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.110> stack<00:03:34.440> up

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
because the other ones sort of stack up

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.350 
because the other ones sort of stack up
against<00:03:34.950> their<00:03:35.190> body<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.880> then<00:03:36.030> makes<00:03:36.239> it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
against their body so and then makes it

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.090 
against their body so and then makes it
a<00:03:36.420> lot<00:03:36.540> more<00:03:36.600> difficult<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:37.500> also<00:03:37.680> struggle

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
a lot more difficult you also struggle

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.490 
a lot more difficult you also struggle
to<00:03:38.579> get<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.209> necessary<00:03:39.390> downward<00:03:40.230> pressure

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
to get the necessary downward pressure

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.620 
to get the necessary downward pressure
because<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.310> rely<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.640> your<00:03:42.000> stomach<00:03:42.390> muscles

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
because you rely on your stomach muscles

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.170 
because you rely on your stomach muscles
to<00:03:42.989> sort<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.290> pull<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.890> over<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.370> ball<00:03:44.579> but

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
to sort of pull you in over the ball but

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.509 
to sort of pull you in over the ball but
possibly<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> biggest<00:03:45.900> problem<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.739> you

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
possibly the biggest problem is that you

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.819 
possibly the biggest problem is that you
struggle<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> seriously

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
struggle to get it this is a seriously

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.699 
struggle to get it this is a seriously
aerobic<00:03:50.640> workout<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.390> what's<00:03:52.200> happening<00:03:52.560> is

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
aerobic workout and what's happening is

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.590 
aerobic workout and what's happening is
your<00:03:52.860> internal<00:03:53.430> organs<00:03:53.579> are<00:03:53.910> pushing<00:03:54.329> up<00:03:54.420> into

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
your internal organs are pushing up into

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.130 
your internal organs are pushing up into
your<00:03:54.840> diaphragm<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.799> lungs<00:03:56.070> can't

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
your diaphragm and your lungs can't

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.300 
your diaphragm and your lungs can't
