00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 today's info has the following themes 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.429
 now with voice recordings equal to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.800
 Add a mood gateway 3ds 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.590
 how is it with the 3ds card on mine 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.299
 channel continues to be classic here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.449
 processes flash cards as we know it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.970
 illuminated partner channel tree admits 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.480
 some topics no videos specialty 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.060
 glass 100 subscribers from special camera 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 was there was the last video only in 480p 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.780
 and let's get to the next topic 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.890
 website what's up with you 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.719
 now it has happened 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 this is the first video on this 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.480
 channel in which I talk 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 Not everyone will sit in the future 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 be set to music on this channel and be 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.489
 I will also have some old videos 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.190
 upload and re-tune with it, too 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.809
 understandable is one can to the next 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 point of the money lends 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.530
 as you know, the cards are 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.609
 to be compatible with the firmware 4.0 -10 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.220
 and my 3ds is already at 6,195 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.450
 I have to have a solution 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 besides, unfortunately, I do not have one either 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
 We got an example review and we had to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 to come up with a solution for that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 I could still have a video 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.880
 because you also have the updater with you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.290
 normal flashcards can play it 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 is as now you the one with the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.390
 blue goes away would look like this 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.090
 and it's really just a whole 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.049
 burn normal endres 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.659
 I also find a new category 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.049
 open up and the flash cards class 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.049
 can 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.850
 I'll go there sooner instead of 1 and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.079
 introduce two cards 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.880
 I would already have a few in 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.369
 sweden at city ​​01 ordered media 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.409
 these are just in europe but have 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 a much bigger selection 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.970
 the link can be found in writing 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 and take the classics of the flash 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 Cards will also be software tutorials 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.049
 for all flash cards like for example 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.939
 which are the pdl de patching cinemas 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.829
 I think these videos upload 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.310
 if they just fit and I do not 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.560
 has something up to date or 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.229
 do not understand any video 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.599
 may want is already here 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.060
 noticed that I like videos 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.330
 example installation tutorial for the 4th 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.000
 iphone 3gs function to scrape me off 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.769
 That's because I have a partner 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.410
 channel has already a video 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.380
 I have uploaded and solid soccer 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.530
 can of course ask in the fields 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.080
 answer 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.569
 but I also often to the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.880
 left channel and if you still ask 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.549
 has the sds plus I have now synonymous 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.900
 but I do not know how to make a video because 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.569
 that has everything covered com is going to 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.360
 abo specials he knows that they are at 50 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.500
 subscribers have made a special and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.080
 some of you also know that they 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.989
 wanted to do there with 1 but that's it 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.459
 nothing has become because I hold the five 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.500
 trains have finished as they already 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.269
 almost 100 had because somehow 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 One day I have 50 subscribers or 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.410
 provide a shower and so are the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.440
 next car special probably first 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.900
 explore at 250 like some of you 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.170
 I certainly noticed that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.850
 last video about the 3ds chain 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.700
 the non-recording and the sms 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.220
 works a worse camera 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.170
 as recorded at a normal and 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.299
 I still have that for 180 php 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.170
 but at least first I have to sometimes 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.019
 Upload 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.150
 because it's not in 16 9 because of that 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.220
 gets a guys in the office 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.889
 the problem is that my normal 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.380
 Camera is broken so the had 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.540
 Problems with the SD cards are running 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.870
 that's why i will have problems now 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.290
 on 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.670
 to upload many high full hd videos 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.700
 old try the quality the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.100
 currently had was we already 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.019
 cnet point of our list for today 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.260
 some of you have certainly noticed 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.870
 that my domain in the last few weeks 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.819
 or months right on his there 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.859
 Domain has changed it has been times 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.430
 it's the flash chart point development ms 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.560
 then summer was four points 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.150
 and now it's flashcard points 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.150
 that for the first time I have the domain 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.610
 it changed the fact that the people 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.200
 where the public have had the 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.349
 just up 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.760
 I had to say first 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.820
 a replacement domain names that already 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.350
 had before and that does not exactly have to 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.500
 the website fits in but is more likely 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.150
 not only have graphics but also around 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.950
 normal flashcards and that's why 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.340
 I then had the domain again 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.630
 change in flash cards score 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.460
 and it was already the first video in 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.780
 I talk to 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.330
 Normally I do not like info 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.800
 videos but in this case I have 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.010
 My exception was because too many 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.010
 Points
