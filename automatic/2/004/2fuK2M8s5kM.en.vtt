00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.000 
pretty good a pretty good push there now
of<00:01:00.449> course<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.190> heavier<00:01:03.090> Manfrotto

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
of course I do have a heavier Manfrotto

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.810 
of course I do have a heavier Manfrotto
top<00:01:05.010> which<00:01:05.159> we're<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.670> here

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
top which we're going to put on here

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
top which we're going to put on here
which<00:01:05.939> should<00:01:06.119> give<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.659> weight

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
which should give it some good weight

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.530 
which should give it some good weight
but<00:01:07.140> you've<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> couple<00:01:08.090> ports<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.240> there

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
but you've got a couple ports down there

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.960 
but you've got a couple ports down there
threads<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.409> 1/4<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.040> 3/8<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:11.580> gives

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
threads you got 1/4 in 3/8 which gives

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350 
threads you got 1/4 in 3/8 which gives
you<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> nice<00:01:12.360> range<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:13.560> much<00:01:13.799> every<00:01:14.360> setup

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you a nice range pretty much every setup

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
you a nice range pretty much every setup
you<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.900> either<00:01:16.020> 3/8<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:16.740> 1/4<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.030> can

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you have is either 3/8 or 1/4 so you can

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.630 
you have is either 3/8 or 1/4 so you can
you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.200> take<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> chance<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.220> guess<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you know take a chance and guess that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
you know take a chance and guess that
you<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.200> ends<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.530> real

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you would have that so the ends are real

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
you would have that so the ends are real
easy<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.060> gonna<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
easy to put on if this is gonna be like

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
easy to put on if this is gonna be like
a<00:01:24.509> mobile<00:01:24.930> version<00:01:25.110> where<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.400> can

a mobile version where you're at you can

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
a mobile version where you're at you can
adjust<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> legs<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.439> real

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
adjust the legs on there and it's real

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.730 
adjust the legs on there and it's real
easy<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.720> spin<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> course<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
easy to spin that on and of course you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
easy to spin that on and of course you
have<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:31.920> legs<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.610> adjustable<00:01:32.850> so

these but simply take the fluid head off
the<00:02:04.680> top<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:06.149> reveals<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.600> thread<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.259> top

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the top and it reveals the thread on top

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.190 
the top and it reveals the thread on top
of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> tripod<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.569> instance<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
of the tripod which in this instance I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
of the tripod which in this instance I
believe<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> 3/8<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.520> you're<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.270> set

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
believe is the 3/8 so you're all set

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.350 
believe is the 3/8 so you're all set
with<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
with that and we

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.680 
with that and we
grab<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.750> slider<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.380> spin<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.690> again

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
grab the slider and spin that on again

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.330 
grab the slider and spin that on again
you've<00:02:16.900> got<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.170> 3/8<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.740> 1/4<00:02:18.100> down

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you've got the 3/8 and the 1/4 down

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.400 
you've got the 3/8 and the 1/4 down
there<00:02:18.490> in<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:18.670> instance<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.780> have<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.020> 3/8

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
there in this instance we have the 3/8

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.860 
there in this instance we have the 3/8
and<00:02:20.710> we'll<00:02:20.890> go<00:02:21.070> ahead<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.370> spin<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:24.870> all

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and we'll go ahead and spin this on all

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.540 
and we'll go ahead and spin this on all
right<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.290> enough<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.620> ridiculousness

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
right so enough of that ridiculousness

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.490 
right so enough of that ridiculousness
we've<00:02:27.730> got<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> Manfrotto<00:02:28.540> here<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.020> 3/8

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
inch thread and unfortunately we have a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.230 
inch thread and unfortunately we have a
quarter<00:02:32.230> inch<00:02:32.380> male<00:02:32.680> nipple<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.520> block

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
quarter inch male nipple on the block

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.480 
quarter inch male nipple on the block

Manfrotto fluid head that I have so
we'll<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.740> go<00:02:41.890> ahead<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.280> spin<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.910> bottom

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
we'll just go ahead and spin the bottom

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.670 
we'll just go ahead and spin the bottom
in<00:02:43.360> there<00:02:43.510> which<00:02:43.690> will<00:02:43.930> allow<00:02:44.140> us<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.320> thread

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
in there which will allow us to thread

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.710 
in there which will allow us to thread
it<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.980> our<00:02:45.010> block<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.670> we'll<00:02:46.330> go<00:02:46.480> ahead

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.680 
it in to our block and we'll go ahead
and<00:02:47.020> put<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.880> alright<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.150> once<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.510> have

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
and put this on alright so once we have

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.690 
and put this on alright so once we have
that<00:02:49.720> all<00:02:50.050> locked<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.620> tight<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.459> see

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
that all locked in tight you can see

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
that all locked in tight you can see
here<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.030> got<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> nice<00:02:52.390> little<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.780> little<00:02:52.900> glide

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
here we got a nice little a little glide

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.620 
here we got a nice little a little glide
going<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.739> there<00:02:53.920> now<00:02:54.100> obviously<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.360> back

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
going on there now obviously going back

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.150 
going on there now obviously going back
and<00:02:55.870> looking<00:02:55.989> at<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.410> after<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> filmed<00:02:57.130> that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
and looking at this after I filmed that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100 
and looking at this after I filmed that
you<00:02:57.310> could<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:57.610> an<00:02:57.760> ever<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.330> slight<00:02:58.360> change

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
you could see an ever so slight change

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.949 
you could see an ever so slight change
in<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.410> leveling<00:03:00.010> there<00:03:00.360> from<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.540> side<00:03:01.750> to

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
in the leveling there from one side to

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.290 
in the leveling there from one side to
another<00:03:01.989> whether<00:03:02.620> that's<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.220> too<00:03:03.940> heavy<00:03:04.180> for

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
another whether that's a too heavy for

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.640 
another whether that's a too heavy for
the<00:03:05.640> slider<00:03:06.640> itself<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.020> know<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the slider itself or you know just the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.650 
the slider itself or you know just the
design<00:03:09.010> I'm<00:03:09.280> I'm<00:03:09.550> sure<00:03:09.790> once<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.510> more

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
design I'm I'm sure once you get more

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.729 
design I'm I'm sure once you get more
expensive<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.640> won't<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.440> you

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
expensive you won't have that but you

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.260 
expensive you won't have that but you
know<00:03:14.860> for<00:03:15.040> what<00:03:15.190> we're<00:03:15.310> doing<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.790> don't<00:03:16.090> think

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
know for what we're doing I don't think

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.640 
know for what we're doing I don't think
I'm<00:03:16.570> really<00:03:16.720> gonna<00:03:16.989> notice<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.500> whole

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
I'm really gonna notice a whole

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.300 
I'm really gonna notice a whole
difference<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.420> okay<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:19.989> let's<00:03:20.980> test

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
difference in that okay so let's test

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.250 
difference in that okay so let's test
this<00:03:21.519> out<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.970> what<00:03:22.209> better<00:03:22.540> way<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> do<00:03:23.049> this

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
this out and what better way to do this

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.009 
this out and what better way to do this
then<00:03:23.980> in<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> most<00:03:24.580> juvenile<00:03:25.299> way<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.780> can

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
then in the most juvenile way that I can

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.240 
then in the most juvenile way that I can
think<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.470> at<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.340> man<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.730> my<00:03:27.910> age<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.410> uh<00:03:29.440> play

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250

$99.99<00:04:13.090> amazon.com<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.360> think<00:04:14.630> with<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
$99.99 amazon.com I think with the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.170 
$99.99 amazon.com I think with the
heavier<00:04:15.400> mounting<00:04:16.400> bracket<00:04:16.730> on<00:04:16.820> top<00:04:17.000> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
heavier mounting bracket on top the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.210 
heavier mounting bracket on top the
heavier<00:04:17.419> fluid<00:04:17.630> head<00:04:17.900> works<00:04:18.680> out<00:04:18.829> much<00:04:18.980> better

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
heavier fluid head works out much better

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.060 
heavier fluid head works out much better
so<00:04:19.609> that<00:04:20.359> is<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.019> first<00:04:21.200> look<00:04:21.410> if<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.919> guys
