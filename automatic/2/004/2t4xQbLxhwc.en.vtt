okay fine so you want spy bemused it or
as<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.510> oh<00:02:16.880> he<00:02:17.880> doesn't<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.180> any<00:02:18.330> moonstone

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
as well oh he doesn't have any moonstone

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.259 
as well oh he doesn't have any moonstone
all<00:02:19.160> well<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> guess<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:20.910> isn't<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
all well I guess that's it then isn't it

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.170 
all well I guess that's it then isn't it
well<00:02:21.900> basically<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.489> come<00:02:23.640> here<00:02:23.819> early

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
well basically if you come here early

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.570 
well basically if you come here early
enough<00:02:24.530> he<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.799> moonstone<00:02:26.130> or<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.459> you

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
enough he will have moonstone or for you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.509 
enough he will have moonstone or for you
so<00:02:27.030> straight<00:02:27.989> after<00:02:28.110> 8<00:02:28.380> a.m.<00:02:28.680> when<00:02:29.069> he<00:02:29.160> opens

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
so straight after 8 a.m. when he opens

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.340 
so straight after 8 a.m. when he opens
if<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.880> come<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.330> he<00:02:30.660> most<00:02:30.900> likely<00:02:31.049> will

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
if you come in here he most likely will

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.050 
if you come in here he most likely will
have<00:02:31.500> moons<00:02:31.709> don't<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.430> doesn't<00:02:32.790> then

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
have moons don't if he doesn't then

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.650 
have moons don't if he doesn't then
you've<00:02:33.690> got<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.049> wait<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:35.209> wait<00:02:36.209> wait<00:02:36.480> it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you've got to wait and just wait wait it

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.840 
you've got to wait and just wait wait it
out<00:02:36.720> until<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.110> does<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.459> if<00:02:38.760> not

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
out until it does have it but if not

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.490 
out until it does have it but if not
don't<00:02:39.090> forget<00:02:39.390> his<00:02:39.540> wife<00:02:39.690> also<00:02:39.900> has<00:02:40.110> moonstone

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
don't forget his wife also has moonstone

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.610 
don't forget his wife also has moonstone
all<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.120> I've<00:02:42.239> got<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.989> tutorial

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
all so that so I've got to do a tutorial

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.830 
all so that so I've got to do a tutorial
with<00:02:44.040> only<00:02:44.160> two<00:02:44.400> means<00:02:44.610> didn't<00:02:44.819> walls<00:02:44.940> no<00:02:45.660> good

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
with only two means didn't walls no good

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.400 
with only two means didn't walls no good
idea<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.290> oh<00:02:46.380> well<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.799> work<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:49.080> once<00:02:49.319> you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
idea but oh well it work so once you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.870 
idea but oh well it work so once you
have<00:02:49.470> moonstone<00:02:49.890> or<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.459> need<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.640> make<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
have moonstone or you need to make it

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.970 
have moonstone or you need to make it
into<00:02:51.060> refined<00:02:51.540> moonstone<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:52.860> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
into refined moonstone and you do that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.400 
into refined moonstone and you do that
by<00:02:53.099> going<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.400> smelter<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.420> smelter<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.290> one

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
by going to smelter and smelter is one

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.410 
by going to smelter and smelter is one
of<00:02:55.470> these<00:02:55.620> big<00:02:55.980> things<00:02:56.010> those<00:02:56.910> people<00:02:56.940> miss

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
of these big things those people miss

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.940 
of these big things those people miss
them<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.959> when<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.470> first<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.920> through

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
them like when you first go through

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.250 
them like when you first go through
right<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.549> you<00:03:00.090> actually<00:03:00.359> don't<00:03:00.570> realize

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
right one you actually don't realize

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
right one you actually don't realize
that<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.590> smelter<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.250> don't<00:03:02.609> know<00:03:02.670> why<00:03:02.850> but<00:03:03.090> I

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that the smelter I don't know why but I

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.580 
that the smelter I don't know why but I
didn't<00:03:03.480> realize<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.840> into<00:03:04.079> that<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.380> look<00:03:04.470> it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
didn't realize it into that and look it

didn't realize it into that and look it
up<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> he<00:03:06.420> did<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> smelter<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.650> obviously<00:03:08.400> you

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
up so he did a smelter and obviously you

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.970 
up so he did a smelter and obviously you
use<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.030> use<00:03:09.329> at<00:03:09.450> suppose<00:03:10.200> 360

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
use a to use at suppose 360

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.870 
use a to use at suppose 360
miscellaneous<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:14.519> want<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.760> make

miscellaneous and you want to make

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.930 
miscellaneous and you want to make
refined<00:03:15.660> moonstone<00:03:18.560> yeah<00:03:19.590> judge<00:03:20.579> creep<00:03:20.819> you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
refined moonstone yeah judge creep you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.990 
refined moonstone yeah judge creep you
have<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.269> item<00:03:21.450> quite<00:03:22.019> obviously<00:03:22.319> yes<00:03:23.000> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
have this item quite obviously yes and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.449 
have this item quite obviously yes and
you<00:03:24.180> made<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.450> refined<00:03:24.750> moonstone<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.590> now

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
you made you refined moonstone and now

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.420 
you made you refined moonstone and now
if<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> find<00:03:27.420> mass<00:03:27.690> right<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:29.250> don't

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
if you have a find mass right you don't

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.710 
if you have a find mass right you don't
need<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:29.970> anything<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.359> if<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.510> don't

need to do anything but if you don't
have<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> final<00:03:31.260> shot<00:03:31.440> you've<00:03:31.560> got<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.739> use<00:03:31.859> a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
have a final shot you've got to use a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.360 
have a final shot you've got to use a
smelt<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.310> my<00:03:33.000> shot<00:03:33.239> as<00:03:33.359> well<00:03:33.980> another<00:03:34.980> site
