a drum set and then the satellite kick
drum<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.030> believe<00:01:24.360> 20<00:01:25.110> by<00:01:25.260> 16<00:01:26.659> reference

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
drum was a I believe 20 by 16 reference

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.820 
drum was a I believe 20 by 16 reference
kick<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.090> cool<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.830> kind

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
kick and so that was really cool to kind

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.800 
kick and so that was really cool to kind
of<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> experience<00:01:32.729> something<00:01:33.600> very

same sound that way you can play your
stuff<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.549> you're<00:01:59.700> playing<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.000> single<00:02:00.390> base

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
stuff like you're playing a single base

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.170 
stuff like you're playing a single base
with<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> double<00:02:01.770> kick<00:02:02.070> pedal<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.970> looks

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
with a double kick pedal and it looks

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
with a double kick pedal and it looks
cool<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:05.009> sound<00:02:06.049> different<00:02:07.049> more<00:02:07.350> full

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
cool it can sound different more full

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.259 
cool it can sound different more full
because<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.489> beater<00:02:08.729> hitting<00:02:09.090> each

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
because it's one beater hitting each

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.210 
because it's one beater hitting each
drum<00:02:09.750> instead<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.319> two<00:02:10.500> beaters<00:02:10.679> playing<00:02:11.099> on

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the same drum and that kind of thing but

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.250 
the same drum and that kind of thing but
a<00:02:14.400> lot<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.760> times<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.269> complications<00:02:15.989> sake

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
a lot of times for complications sake

a lot of times for complications sake
just<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.219> keep<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.519> simple<00:02:17.669> you<00:02:17.999> use<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.239> double

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
just to keep it simple you use a double

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.780 
just to keep it simple you use a double
pedal<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.079> one<00:02:19.379> kick<00:02:19.620> drum<00:02:19.859> and<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.669> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
pedal on one kick drum and so in this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.290 
pedal on one kick drum and so in this
instance

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
instance

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.210 
instance
and<00:02:21.570> for<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.900> video<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.320> for<00:02:22.740> what<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> was

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and for this video and for what I was

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.340 
and for this video and for what I was
doing<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.850> Nashville<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.900> video<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
doing in Nashville and the video that

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200 
doing in Nashville and the video that
you<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.470> saw<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.220> people<00:02:26.640> were<00:02:26.730> asking<00:02:27.060> for

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
you just saw and people were asking for

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.630 
you just saw and people were asking for
a<00:02:27.270> next<00:02:27.480> elimination<00:02:27.830> explanation<00:02:28.830> about<00:02:29.070> I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
a next elimination explanation about I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.550 
a next elimination explanation about I
was<00:02:30.090> using<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> double<00:02:30.690> kick<00:02:30.840> pedal<00:02:30.990> on<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
was using a double kick pedal on the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.410 
was using a double kick pedal on the
marching<00:02:31.920> kick<00:02:32.220> drum<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> then<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.210> using

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
marching kick drum and then I was using

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.860 
marching kick drum and then I was using
a<00:02:33.840> satellite<00:02:34.800> kick<00:02:35.250> using<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.120> double<00:02:36.420> pedal<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
a satellite kick using a double pedal to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.010 
a satellite kick using a double pedal to
play<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.920> that's<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.240> what<00:02:39.630> this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
play it and so that's this is what this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.560 
play it and so that's this is what this
video<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:41.330> explanation<00:02:42.330> on

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
video is all about is explanation on

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.080 
video is all about is explanation on
what<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.590> why<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.520> how<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
what that is and why it is like how it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.940 
what that is and why it is like how it
works<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.720> what<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.440> would<00:02:46.620> use<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.920> for

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
works and what you would use it for

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.220 
works and what you would use it for
because<00:02:47.340> people<00:02:47.610> were<00:02:47.670> confused<00:02:48.030> by<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:49.050> kick

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
because people were confused by the kick

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.760 
because people were confused by the kick
pedal<00:02:49.380> setup<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:52.020> can<00:02:52.140> see<00:02:52.200> probably

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
pedal setup so as you can see probably

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.620 
pedal setup so as you can see probably
from<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.070> GoPro<00:02:53.250> angle<00:02:53.700> down<00:02:53.820> here<00:02:53.850> I'll

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
from this GoPro angle down here I'll

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.940 
from this GoPro angle down here I'll
switch<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.290> here's<00:02:55.980> my<00:02:56.100> normal<00:02:56.640> kick<00:02:57.950> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
switch to that here's my normal kick you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.120 
switch to that here's my normal kick you
can<00:02:59.100> play<00:02:59.360> both<00:03:00.360> feet<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.470> main<00:03:01.620> kick<00:03:01.890> drum

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
can play both feet on the main kick drum

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.640 
can play both feet on the main kick drum
then<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.720> look<00:03:03.900> over<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.350> see<00:03:04.410> this

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
then you look over and you see this

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.760 
then you look over and you see this
other<00:03:04.830> kick<00:03:05.070> drum<00:03:05.310> over<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.260> I'll

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
other kick drum over here and I'll

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.850 
other kick drum over here and I'll
switch<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.310> angle<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.820> second<00:03:11.480> so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
switch to this angle for a second so

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.400 
switch to this angle for a second so
there's<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.010> other<00:03:14.190> kick<00:03:14.490> drum<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.410> it's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
there's this other kick drum and it's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.880 
there's this other kick drum and it's
set<00:03:16.620> up<00:03:16.650> with<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.580> double<00:03:18.030> kick<00:03:18.210> pedal<00:03:18.710> over<00:03:19.710> to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
set up with a double kick pedal over to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.400 
set up with a double kick pedal over to
it<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.820> use<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.690> left<00:03:21.900> side<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.380> left

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
it and you use the left side the left

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.770 
it and you use the left side the left
foot<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.920> slave<00:03:23.130> pedal<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:24.150> play<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.600> kick

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
foot the slave pedal to play that kick

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.090 
foot the slave pedal to play that kick
drum<00:03:24.870> over<00:03:25.140> there<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.650> move<00:03:26.010> your

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
drum over there so you just move your

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.660 
drum over there so you just move your
foot<00:03:26.310> over<00:03:29.630> boom<00:03:30.980> now<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.310> all<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> sudden

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
foot over boom now you can all a sudden

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.699 
foot over boom now you can all a sudden
play<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.239> kick<00:03:33.480> drum<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.590> can

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
play that kick drum and so you can

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.840 
play that kick drum and so you can
switch<00:03:34.920> back<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.160> forth<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.370> get<00:03:41.550> two

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
switch back and forth and you get two

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.220 
switch back and forth and you get two
different<00:03:42.060> kick<00:03:42.450> drum<00:03:42.750> tones<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.930> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
different kick drum tones and so that is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.620 
different kick drum tones and so that is
the<00:03:46.739> main<00:03:46.950> reasoning<00:03:47.489> behind<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:48.209> satellite

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
the main reasoning behind a satellite

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.590 
the main reasoning behind a satellite
kick<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.560> actually<00:03:50.280> removed<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.270> rack

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
kick and so I actually removed the rack

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.360 
kick and so I actually removed the rack
system<00:03:52.050> over<00:03:52.290> here<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> floor<00:03:52.830> tom<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.280> you

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
system over here in the floor tom so you

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.850 
system over here in the floor tom so you
could<00:03:53.489> get<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.640> better<00:03:53.880> shot<00:03:54.330> from<00:03:55.050> my<00:03:55.350> GoPro

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
could get a better shot from my GoPro

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.860 
could get a better shot from my GoPro
back<00:03:56.070> here<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.400> see<00:03:56.640> how<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.940> works<00:03:57.150> but

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
back here to see how it works but

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.320 
back here to see how it works but
because<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:59.280> way<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.550> pedals<00:03:59.880> work<00:04:00.090> and

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
because of the way the pedals work and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.090 
because of the way the pedals work and
you<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.020> other<00:04:01.050> portion<00:04:02.010> of

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
you can see it in the other portion of

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.410 
you can see it in the other portion of
this<00:04:02.250> video<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.850> was<00:04:02.970> showing<00:04:03.150> from

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
this video that I was showing from

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.690 
this video that I was showing from
Nashville<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:05.160> see<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:06.230> actual

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
Nashville you can see that the actual

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.820 
Nashville you can see that the actual
connector<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:09.090> drive<00:04:09.420> shaft<00:04:09.690> from<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.500> left
