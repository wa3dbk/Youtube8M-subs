00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
cnc adapters with prop nuts those work

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.810 
cnc adapters with prop nuts those work
out<00:01:47.399> pretty<00:01:47.579> good<00:01:48.500> incidentally<00:01:49.500> those<00:01:49.820> APC

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
out pretty good incidentally those APC

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.990 
out pretty good incidentally those APC
props<00:01:51.090> seem<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> run<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.200> smoother

although I haven't flown it yet in the
air<00:01:56.000> also<00:01:57.000> i'm<00:01:57.990> using<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.070> new<00:02:00.950> eflite

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
air also i'm using the the new eflite

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.660 
air also i'm using the the new eflite
extended<00:02:02.579> landing<00:02:02.939> gear<00:02:03.320> for<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.520> 350<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
extended landing gear for the 350 you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.449 
extended landing gear for the 350 you
can<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> gives<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.450> plenty<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.930> room<00:02:07.459> if

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
can see it gives you plenty of room if

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.760 
can see it gives you plenty of room if
you're<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> use<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> gimbal<00:02:09.770> there's

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you're going to use a gimbal there's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.199 
you're going to use a gimbal there's
plenty<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.129> room<00:02:11.190> under<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
plenty of room under there now so you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.110 
plenty of room under there now so you
don't<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
don't have to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.920 
don't have to
it<00:02:13.239> with<00:02:13.420> pieces<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.780> foam<00:02:15.659> blocks<00:02:16.659> or

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
it with pieces of foam blocks or

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.300 
it with pieces of foam blocks or
anything<00:02:17.230> anymore<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.890> those<00:02:18.069> are<00:02:18.099> pretty

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
anything anymore so those are pretty

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.479 
anything anymore so those are pretty
nice<00:02:18.519> when<00:02:18.760> those<00:02:18.879> become<00:02:19.209> available<00:02:20.489> but

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
nice when those become available but

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.990 
nice when those become available but
anyway<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:23.019> tested<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.940> extra

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
weight on there was testing these two

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.680

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.690 
packs with the regular glacier pack that
I<00:02:31.780> fly<00:02:32.049> all<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.349> time<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.890> instantly<00:02:33.489> those

is what i just did on this damn ok I
wrote<00:03:12.069> him<00:03:12.159> down<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.430> about<00:03:12.549> thirty<00:03:12.879> three

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
wrote him down to about thirty three

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.300 
wrote him down to about thirty three
percent<00:03:13.180> thirty<00:03:13.900> three<00:03:14.140> thirty<00:03:14.379> percent<00:03:14.890> is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
percent thirty three thirty percent is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.159 
percent thirty three thirty percent is
about<00:03:15.849> normal<00:03:16.000> where<00:03:16.329> I<00:03:16.359> run<00:03:16.569> them<00:03:16.720> down<00:03:16.750> too

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
about normal where I run them down too

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.789 
about normal where I run them down too
so<00:03:17.440> that's<00:03:17.620> about<00:03:17.919> right<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.000> okay<00:03:19.599> now<00:03:20.440> I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.690 
picked up some of these electron pros
twenty-seven<00:03:27.790> hundred<00:03:27.819> million<00:03:28.389> packs<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
twenty-seven hundred million packs and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.360 
twenty-seven hundred million packs and
just<00:03:30.700> hovering<00:03:31.030> here<00:03:31.629> in<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.500> living<00:03:32.620> room<00:03:33.069> I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
just hovering here in the living room I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.819 
just hovering here in the living room I
was<00:03:33.639> able<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:34.000> get<00:03:34.180> another<00:03:34.450> extra<00:03:35.109> minute<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
was able to get another extra minute and

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:43.619 
was able to get another extra minute and
10<00:03:36.310> seconds<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:38.739> could<00:03:38.919> run<00:03:39.129> it<00:03:39.340> down<00:03:42.629> to

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
10 seconds and I could run it down to

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.869 
10 seconds and I could run it down to
about<00:03:43.660> 31<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.769> can<00:03:44.919> see<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.129> voltage<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.489> just

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
about 31 you can see the voltage is just

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.990 
about 31 you can see the voltage is just
about<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.269> same<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.590> there<00:03:48.310> again<00:03:48.519> now<00:03:48.730> this

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
about the same so there again now this

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.449 
about the same so there again now this
is<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.120> hovering<00:03:49.599> in<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.750> living<00:03:50.079> room<00:03:50.230> area

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
is just hovering in the living room area

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.800 
is just hovering in the living room area
but<00:03:51.459> that's<00:03:51.609> what<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.879> video<00:03:52.120> downlink<00:03:52.540> on

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
but that's what the video downlink on

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.409 
but that's what the video downlink on
the<00:03:53.290> tilt<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.709> pan<00:03:53.859> on<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.340> camera<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.000> GoPro

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
the tilt and pan on the camera the GoPro

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.539 
the tilt and pan on the camera the GoPro
going<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.079> all<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.530> voltage<00:03:56.889> is<00:03:57.040> being<00:03:57.280> drawn

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
going so all the voltage is being drawn

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.119 
going so all the voltage is being drawn
at<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.760> same<00:03:58.000> time<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.810> little<00:03:59.680> bit<00:03:59.919> better

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
at the same time so a little bit better

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.479 
at the same time so a little bit better
draw<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:01.000> bit<00:04:01.269> longer<00:04:01.480> draw<00:04:01.870> on<00:04:02.400> 27<00:04:03.400> hundred

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
draw a bit longer draw on 27 hundred

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.699 
draw a bit longer draw on 27 hundred
million<00:04:03.940> pack<00:04:04.150> which<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.510> thought<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:05.199> was<00:04:05.530> going

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
million pack which I thought I was going

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.220 
million pack which I thought I was going
to<00:04:05.799> get<00:04:05.980> obviously<00:04:06.730> more<00:04:06.910> million<00:04:07.299> pack<00:04:07.569> but

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
to get obviously more million pack but

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.900 
to get obviously more million pack but
you<00:04:08.349> can<00:04:08.500> see<00:04:09.209> size-wise<00:04:11.280> size-wise<00:04:12.280> are<00:04:12.819> the
