00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hi, I 'm John Ely and today we're going to see 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.000
 how do I comb my hair then 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 we need a brush like these do not 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.140
 I need to necessarily do this but 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 I really like it here there is a little cream 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 to comb with a little water in case 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.040
 The hair is very dry and we are going to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.510
 need gel if many are going to think that 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.090
 because gel but that's what I use to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.220
 comb and lasts all day and is super 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.220
 well then gel 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 we brush well 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.790
 we divide in two which are that to me 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.790
 like it more because I have a lot of hair 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.229
 we make the hair back 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.120
 and we start to take the gel is the brand 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.950
 which I like but can be 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.950
 any other brand that suits them 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.030
 I put 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.390
 enough or a lot because I have a lot 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 hair but depending on the hair that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.670
 the little hair you have you can 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.670
 or not put a lot 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.120
 I screwed moss 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.440
 and we go with the other part 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 so somehow we undo them with 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.770
 the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 and we put another sufficient amount of 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 That this 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.550
 we go back to oscar the hair this what 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 I always do after taking a bath 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.610
 because I do not like to bring dry hair 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.610
 I'm going to do this 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.100
 when I'm in separate or perfect but 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.330
 well separated 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.330
 we have more 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
 we start 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.659
 this movement 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.129
 and we see how the thymus begins to form 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.640
 and we talk to take more and more and more and more 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.320
 always doing the same movement like this 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.080
 so that we give the natural way to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.080
 our chinese 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.580
 we must do it to the root 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.480
 the story is this part now we 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.480
 we go 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.269
 we separate again 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.000
 those who have stayed around with the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.000
 ropes 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.810
 and we do again 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.210
 so hand up 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.430
 okay 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.310
 I like the start very much 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.650
 because another part that you see if it's you 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.260
 you want to leave bayern half 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:07.170
 what is to do scratched two friends 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.170
 everything backwards feels like I have it 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.940
 ah 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.510
 now 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.110
 we do all the hair to face 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.110
 if you want the line in the middle you can 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.870
 leave like that but if not to undo with your 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.770
 hands I really treat the hair for the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.770
 hair lot for here 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.810
 and you continue making the movements 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.810
 before 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.230
 we take back 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.720
 good as you will see it is ready 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.690
 hair 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.970
 already there it depends good on us in others 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.400
 videos I will upload hairstyles already having 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.070
 I'm going to upload hairstyles so they can see 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.360
 more or less that the Chinese is very father 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.840
 this is how it lasts all afternoon 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.960
 I really like it a lot, like it and 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.210
 subscribe 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.520
 share it with your friends with your 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.250
 friends and with all hope that you have 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.259
 liked and that serves them a lot see what is 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.840
 easy side after bathing and to 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.610
 instantly I do not dry it dry number for 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.430
 nothing because with the brush 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.889
 obviously it goes dry and I like it 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.360
 much how it looks like that if you want it 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.680
 trying otherwise is also fine 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.680
 that depends on everyone
