all right to teach you some of the other
properties<00:00:03.270> what<00:00:03.540> I'm<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.870> have<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.049> do

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
properties what I'm going to have to do

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.519 
properties what I'm going to have to do
now<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.440> introduce<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> new<00:00:05.790> material

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
now is introduce you to a new material

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.500 
now is introduce you to a new material
here<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:08.189> object<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.849> want<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.300> is

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
here on this object what I want to do is

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.250 
here on this object what I want to do is
go<00:00:09.690> into<00:00:09.840> rendering<00:00:10.349> hypershade<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:15.230> what<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
go into rendering hypershade and what I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.900 
go into rendering hypershade and what I
need<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:18.060> go<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.460> bins<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
need here is to go to the bins and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.620 
need here is to go to the bins and
choose<00:00:21.180> mental<00:00:21.810> ray<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> materials

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
choose mental ray so they have materials

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.050 
choose mental ray so they have materials
here<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> want<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.310> choose<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
here and what I want to do is choose a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510 
here and what I want to do is choose a
dielectric<00:00:30.960> material<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.980> only<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
dielectric material so not only do you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.620 
dielectric material so not only do you
have<00:00:32.820> all<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.480> Maya<00:00:34.110> nodes<00:00:35.059> but<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
have all the Maya nodes but we have to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.049 
have all the Maya nodes but we have to
learn<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.320> mental<00:00:37.739> ray<00:00:37.950> nodes<00:00:38.190> also<00:00:38.640> so

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
learn all the mental ray nodes also so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.959 
learn all the mental ray nodes also so
there's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.600> lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> material<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.040> let's<00:00:41.820> go

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
there's a lot of material here let's go

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.920 
there's a lot of material here let's go
to<00:00:42.090> dielectric<00:00:42.600> material<00:00:44.690> what<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to dielectric material what I'm going to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
to dielectric material what I'm going to
do<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> choose<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.160> ball<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:48.090> click

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
do is choose the ball then right click

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.990 
do is choose the ball then right click
and<00:00:48.629> assign<00:00:49.440> dielectric<00:00:50.100> material<00:00:50.489> now<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and assign dielectric material now the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
and assign dielectric material now the
only<00:00:51.120> thing<00:00:51.210> bad<00:00:51.480> about<00:00:51.660> mental<00:00:52.050> ray<00:00:52.230> nodes<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
only thing bad about mental ray nodes is

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.689 
only thing bad about mental ray nodes is
there<00:00:53.039> always<00:00:53.219> black<00:00:53.579> always<00:00:54.300> always<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> if

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there always black always always so if

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
there always black always always so if
even<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> render<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> scene<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.680> looks

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
even if you render the scene it looks

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.790 
even if you render the scene it looks
nice<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.670> will<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.570> real<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:01.260> render<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
nice but it will not real time render it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.000 
nice but it will not real time render it
okay<00:01:03.949> here<00:01:04.949> i<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.670> red<00:01:05.909> ball<00:01:09.560> if<00:01:10.560> i<00:01:10.710> render

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
okay here i have a red ball if i render

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.510 
okay here i have a red ball if i render
it<00:01:12.439> you'll<00:01:13.439> notice<00:01:13.799> something<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it you'll notice something about the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.990 
it you'll notice something about the
material

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.400 

it<00:01:22.510> is<00:01:22.950> transparent<00:01:23.950> that's<00:01:24.790> right<00:01:25.410> okay

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
it is transparent that's right okay

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.830 
it is transparent that's right okay
transparent<00:01:27.220> shiny<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.970> it's<00:01:28.180> like<00:01:28.390> glass

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
transparent shiny and it's like glass

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.140 
transparent shiny and it's like glass
that's<00:01:29.410> what<00:01:29.560> dielectric<00:01:30.070> material<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.610> it's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
that's what dielectric material is it's

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.800 
that's what dielectric material is it's
a<00:01:31.330> glass<00:01:31.770> shader<00:01:33.120> okay<00:01:34.120> now<00:01:34.270> let's<00:01:34.510> look<00:01:34.660> at

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
a glass shader okay now let's look at

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.990 
a glass shader okay now let's look at
the<00:01:34.900> material<00:01:35.260> dielectric<00:01:36.070> itself<00:01:36.520> let's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the material dielectric itself let's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.150 
the material dielectric itself let's
click<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.720> let's<00:01:38.590> change<00:01:38.920> its

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
click on it and let's change its

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.680 
click on it and let's change its
properties<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.970> something<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.390> little<00:01:40.510> bit

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
properties to something a little bit

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.660 
properties to something a little bit
more<00:01:40.810> interesting<00:01:41.050> like<00:01:41.500> red<00:01:41.920> okay<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:44.670> always

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
more interesting like red okay I always

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.420 
more interesting like red okay I always
do<00:01:45.940> red<00:01:46.180> let's<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.570> blue<00:01:48.420> ok<00:01:49.420> now<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:50.890> inside

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
do red let's do blue ok now it's inside

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
do red let's do blue ok now it's inside
color<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:53.979> thing<00:01:54.220> about

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
color is that but the one thing about

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.480 
color is that but the one thing about
dielectric<00:01:55.450> materials<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.320> if<00:01:56.950> they're<00:01:57.310> not

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
dielectric materials is if they're not

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.070 
dielectric materials is if they're not
going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.729> look<00:01:57.910> good<00:01:57.970> without<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.690> different

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
going to look good without a different

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.870 
going to look good without a different
rendering<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.890> that's<00:02:00.100> why<00:02:00.280> i<00:02:00.310> chose

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
rendering and that's why i chose

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.450 
rendering and that's why i chose
dielectric<00:02:01.509> because<00:02:01.960> now<00:02:02.110> i<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.470> show<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
dielectric because now i can show you a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.350 
dielectric because now i can show you a
different<00:02:03.970> feature<00:02:04.300> called<00:02:04.930> caustics<00:02:06.360> so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
different feature called caustics so

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.800 
different feature called caustics so
caustics<00:02:08.160> allows<00:02:09.270> light<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.300> pass<00:02:10.780> through

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
caustics allows light to pass through

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.870 
caustics allows light to pass through
glass<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.150> give<00:02:13.150> off<00:02:13.390> caustic<00:02:13.989> properties

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
glass and give off caustic properties

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.510 
glass and give off caustic properties
caustics<00:02:15.880> are<00:02:16.180> when<00:02:16.959> let's<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.280> shine

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
caustics are when let's see if you shine

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.370 
caustics are when let's see if you shine
light<00:02:18.790> through<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:19.150> liquid<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.350> liquid

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
light through a liquid and the liquid

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.510 
light through a liquid and the liquid
casts<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.340> light<00:02:21.610> onto<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.060> floor<00:02:22.330> those

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
casts a light onto the floor those

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.800 
casts a light onto the floor those
pieces<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.700> light<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.180> are<00:02:25.330> dancing<00:02:25.690> around

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
pieces of light that are dancing around

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.770 
pieces of light that are dancing around
art<00:02:26.290> caustics<00:02:31.860> you'll<00:02:32.860> also<00:02:33.010> hear

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
art caustics you'll also hear

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.240 
art caustics you'll also hear
reflections<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.959> refractions<00:02:38.250> reflections

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
reflections and refractions reflections

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.170 
reflections and refractions reflections
the<00:02:39.940> light<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.390> bouncing<00:02:41.350> off<00:02:42.000> refraction<00:02:43.000> is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
the light is bouncing off refraction is

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.440 
the light is bouncing off refraction is
when<00:02:43.720> light<00:02:43.959> passes<00:02:44.200> through<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.269> gives<00:02:46.269> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
when light passes through and gives a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.900 
when light passes through and gives a
distortion<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> view<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.489> other<00:02:48.610> side

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
distortion of the view on the other side

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.680 
distortion of the view on the other side
so<00:02:49.540> see<00:02:49.840> how<00:02:50.049> now<00:02:50.709> we<00:02:50.769> have<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.510> sphere<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
so see how now we have this sphere and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.080 
so see how now we have this sphere and
you<00:02:52.989> can<00:02:53.140> see<00:02:53.320> kind<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.739> through<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.010> let<00:02:54.970> me

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
you can see kind of through it let me

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.660 
you can see kind of through it let me
increase<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.989> resolution<00:02:56.320> size<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.370> so

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
increase the resolution size on this so

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:07.150 
increase the resolution size on this so
we<00:02:57.910> can<00:02:57.940> get<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.299> better<00:02:58.360> render

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.410 

now<00:03:08.160> there's<00:03:08.520> one<00:03:08.730> more<00:03:08.790> thing<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.330> have

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
now there's one more thing that we have

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.920 
now there's one more thing that we have
not<00:03:09.780> done<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.310> introduced<00:03:12.180> photon

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
not done and that is introduced photon

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.830 
not done and that is introduced photon
Cinemax<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.940> right<00:03:15.150> now<00:03:15.180> you're<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.480> going

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
Cinemax so right now you're just going

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.250 
Cinemax so right now you're just going
to<00:03:15.990> get<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.290> blue<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> super<00:03:18.840> kind<00:03:19.110> of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
to get this blue so super kind of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.880 
to get this blue so super kind of
looking<00:03:19.740> cool<00:03:20.160> thing<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:21.330> lot<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
looking cool thing with a lot of

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.260 
looking cool thing with a lot of
reflections<00:03:22.890> out<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.240> all

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
reflections out of it so you can see all

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.160 
reflections out of it so you can see all
the<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.750> shapes<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:26.130> here<00:03:28.850> but<00:03:30.020> for<00:03:31.020> right

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
the little shapes in here but for right

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.140 
the little shapes in here but for right
now<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.650> doesn't<00:03:31.680> have<00:03:32.160> any<00:03:32.310> caustics

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
now it doesn't have any caustics

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.420 
now it doesn't have any caustics
appearing<00:03:33.660> here<00:03:33.930> caustics<00:03:34.920> are<00:03:35.070> turned<00:03:35.280> on

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
appearing here caustics are turned on

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.720 
appearing here caustics are turned on
but<00:03:36.390> there's<00:03:36.930> nothing<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.590> go<00:03:37.770> through<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
but there's nothing to go through the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.420 
but there's nothing to go through the
device<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.420> order<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.350> caustics<00:03:41.040> appear

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
device in order to have caustics appear

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.660 
device in order to have caustics appear
on<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> other<00:03:41.910> side<00:03:42.210> so<00:03:42.990> that's<00:03:43.170> our<00:03:43.350> next

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
on to the other side so that's our next

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.430 
on to the other side so that's our next
mission<00:03:44.670> how<00:03:44.970> do<00:03:45.030> we<00:03:45.210> get<00:03:45.390> caustics<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.560> appear

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
mission how do we get caustics to appear

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.080 
mission how do we get caustics to appear
and<00:03:49.440> caustics<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.550> lot<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.060> with

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
and caustics have a lot to do with

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.190 
and caustics have a lot to do with
photon<00:03:52.100> I'm<00:03:53.100> going<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.340> hit<00:03:53.430> escape<00:03:53.960> so<00:03:54.960> I<00:03:55.050> can

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
photon I'm going to hit escape so I can

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.750 
photon I'm going to hit escape so I can
see<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.470> corner<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:55.950> here<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.520> is<00:03:56.580> the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
see that corner right here this is the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.910 
see that corner right here this is the
corner<00:03:57.210> that<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.420> see<00:03:57.690> right<00:03:57.840> here<00:03:58.110> let's<00:03:58.770> see

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
corner that I see right here let's see

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.290 
corner that I see right here let's see
all<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> spheres<00:04:00.380> okay<00:04:01.380> now<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.950> order<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.090> get

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
all the spheres okay now in order to get

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.690 
all the spheres okay now in order to get
caustics<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.670> must<00:04:05.670> look<00:04:05.820> at<00:04:05.970> my<00:04:06.090> lights<00:04:06.360> and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
caustics I must look at my lights and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.690 
caustics I must look at my lights and
the<00:04:08.700> light<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.330> best<00:04:10.220> represents<00:04:11.220> caustic

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the light that best represents caustic

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.540 
the light that best represents caustic
properties<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.870> spotlight<00:04:13.520> because<00:04:14.520> I

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
properties is the spotlight because I

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:23.240 
properties is the spotlight because I
can<00:04:14.850> aim<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:16.130> okay<00:04:17.130> now<00:04:19.010> photons<00:04:20.010> are<00:04:22.250> two

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
can aim it okay now photons are two

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.190 
can aim it okay now photons are two
located<00:04:23.640> under<00:04:23.850> mental<00:04:24.030> ray<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:27.170> right<00:04:28.170> here

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
located under mental ray and right here

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.320 
located under mental ray and right here
it<00:04:28.590> says<00:04:28.650> caustic<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.610> global<00:04:30.120> illumination

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
it says caustic and global illumination

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.440 
it says caustic and global illumination
emit<00:04:31.260> photons<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:33.030> I'm<00:04:33.120> going<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.270> go<00:04:33.420> ahead

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
emit photons so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.860 
emit photons so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:33.690> emit<00:04:34.110> photons<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:35.640> then<00:04:36.540> I'll<00:04:36.720> go

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
and emit photons and then I'll go

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.870 
and emit photons and then I'll go
through<00:04:37.140> what<00:04:37.350> these<00:04:37.620> are<00:04:37.890> right<00:04:38.160> here<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:38.430> a

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
through what these are right here in a

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.010 
through what these are right here in a
second<00:04:39.890> also<00:04:40.890> under<00:04:41.400> mental<00:04:41.610> ray<00:04:41.970> just<00:04:42.780> make

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
second also under mental ray just make

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.170 
second also under mental ray just make
sure<00:04:43.160> caustics<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.550> think<00:04:44.820> we<00:04:45.060> already

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
sure caustics is on I think we already

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.490 
sure caustics is on I think we already
did<00:04:45.390> that<00:04:45.570> Yelp<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:47.010> quality<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:48.500> don't

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
did that Yelp and the quality I don't

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.600 
did that Yelp and the quality I don't
think<00:04:49.590> they<00:04:49.830> have<00:04:49.980> a<00:04:50.010> caustic<00:04:50.460> quality<00:04:50.970> nope

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.580 

nope

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
nope

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:07.279 
nope
ok

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.170 

they<00:05:07.589> have<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.770> photon<00:05:08.219> map<00:05:08.550> oh<00:05:08.849> here's

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
they have a photon map oh here's

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.200 
they have a photon map oh here's
caustics<00:05:12.800> okay<00:05:13.800> radius<00:05:14.279> and<00:05:14.460> scale<00:05:14.699> all<00:05:14.969> right

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
caustics okay radius and scale all right

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.489 
caustics okay radius and scale all right
let's<00:05:15.839> just<00:05:16.080> give<00:05:16.229> it<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.439> go<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:20.990> like<00:05:21.990> adjusting

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:22.499 
let's just give it a go I like adjusting

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:27.079 
let's just give it a go I like adjusting

back<00:05:38.699> side<00:05:38.939> of<00:05:38.999> this<00:05:39.210> object<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:40.279> there's<00:05:41.279> a

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:41.339 
back side of this object and there's a

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.339 
back side of this object and there's a
lot<00:05:41.490> more<00:05:41.659> caustics<00:05:42.659> appearing<00:05:43.020> over<00:05:43.199> there

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
lot more caustics appearing over there

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.679 
lot more caustics appearing over there
because<00:05:43.619> of<00:05:43.770> that<00:05:43.919> rim<00:05:44.249> light<00:05:44.520> or<00:05:44.729> backlight

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
because of that rim light or backlight

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:58.550 
because of that rim light or backlight
appearing

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.400 

you<00:05:59.560> can<00:05:59.680> also<00:05:59.830> see<00:06:00.160> that<00:06:00.190> if<00:06:00.810> slowed<00:06:01.810> down<00:06:02.110> my

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
you can also see that if slowed down my

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:10.620 
you can also see that if slowed down my
rendering<00:06:02.770> quite<00:06:03.010> a<00:06:03.040> bit<00:06:09.270> so<00:06:10.270> what<00:06:10.390> I'm<00:06:10.480> going

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
rendering quite a bit so what I'm going

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.100 
rendering quite a bit so what I'm going
to<00:06:10.660> do<00:06:10.870> is<00:06:12.030> stop<00:06:13.030> this<00:06:13.210> video<00:06:13.480> right<00:06:13.660> here<00:06:13.690> and

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
to do is stop this video right here and

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.840 
to do is stop this video right here and
show<00:06:14.290> you<00:06:14.350> how<00:06:14.560> to<00:06:14.620> adjust<00:06:14.890> photons<00:06:15.580> in<00:06:15.760> the

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
show you how to adjust photons in the

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.330 
show you how to adjust photons in the
next<00:06:16.060> video
