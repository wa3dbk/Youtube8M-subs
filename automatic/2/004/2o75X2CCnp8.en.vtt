00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
everybody just a quick update from my

everybody just a quick update from my
last<00:00:01.800> 2<00:00:01.979> unboxing<00:00:02.129> videos<00:00:02.790> as<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.810> can<00:00:03.959> see<00:00:04.170> I

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
last 2 unboxing videos as you can see I

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.039 
last 2 unboxing videos as you can see I
installed<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.130> Zion<00:00:05.970> 1000<00:00:06.629> watt<00:00:06.720> power<00:00:06.960> supply

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
installed my Zion 1000 watt power supply

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.110 
installed my Zion 1000 watt power supply
I<00:00:07.560> didn't<00:00:08.160> really<00:00:08.340> follow<00:00:08.490> cable<00:00:08.940> management

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I didn't really follow cable management

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.790 
I didn't really follow cable management
this<00:00:09.420> time<00:00:09.630> around<00:00:09.780> because<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.290> couldn't<00:00:10.530> fit

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this time around because I couldn't fit

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.870 
this time around because I couldn't fit
the<00:00:11.070> other<00:00:11.490> back<00:00:12.150> panel<00:00:12.540> onto<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.960> case<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.880> I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the other back panel onto my case and I

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400 
the other back panel onto my case and I
just<00:00:15.120> wanted<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> case<00:00:15.809> closed<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.320> I

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
just wanted to have the case closed so I

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.040 
just wanted to have the case closed so I
decided<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.070> just<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> cables<00:00:18.779> inside

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
decided to just do all the cables inside

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.590 
decided to just do all the cables inside
the<00:00:19.199> case<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.859> kind<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> mess<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.600> it's

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the case it's kind of a mess but it's

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.820 
the case it's kind of a mess but it's
something<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.230> probably<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.650> go

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
something that I can probably just go

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.750 
something that I can probably just go
back<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> tie<00:00:23.550> them<00:00:23.609> off<00:00:23.820> my<00:00:24.060> zip<00:00:24.269> ties<00:00:24.449> later

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
back and tie them off my zip ties later

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.960 
back and tie them off my zip ties later
what<00:00:26.760> else<00:00:26.930> my<00:00:27.930> video<00:00:28.230> card<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.400> galaxy

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
what else my video card it's a galaxy

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
edition so it's non reference card so
it's<00:00:38.160> got<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.520> dual<00:00:38.700> fan<00:00:38.910> solution<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it's got a dual fan solution for the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
it's got a dual fan solution for the
coolers<00:00:40.140> he's<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.100> nice<00:00:41.520> big<00:00:41.760> copper<00:00:42.149> heatpipes

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
coolers he's a nice big copper heatpipes

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
coolers he's a nice big copper heatpipes
right<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.530> good

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
right here so that's going to be good

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.060 
right here so that's going to be good

motherboard it's the 970 de three you
three<00:00:49.860> s3<00:00:50.520> motherboard<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.440> funny

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
three s3 motherboard now the the funny

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.400 
three s3 motherboard now the the funny
thing<00:00:53.129> about<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.520> board<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.140> yes<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
thing about this board is that yes it is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.630 
thing about this board is that yes it is
an<00:00:55.530> ATX<00:00:55.890> board<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:58.410> only<00:00:58.680> 80<00:00:58.859> x<00:00:59.219> in

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
an ATX board but it's only 80 x in

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.779 
an ATX board but it's only 80 x in
length<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> TX<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> width<00:01:01.789> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
length and it's not a TX and width as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
length and it's not a TX and width as
you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you can see it's kind of like it's a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219 
you can see it's kind of like it's a
sure<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:05.369> short<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.060> thin<00:01:06.720> motherboard

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
sure not short but it's thin motherboard

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.010 
sure not short but it's thin motherboard
in<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:08.340> sense<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.570> doesn't<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:09.990> up

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
in a sense that it's it doesn't take up

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.500 
in a sense that it's it doesn't take up
a<00:01:10.229> whole<00:01:10.350> motherboard<00:01:10.650> tray<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> case

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
a whole motherboard tray for the case

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.510 
a whole motherboard tray for the case
and<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> an<00:01:13.890> interesting<00:01:13.979> thing

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and that's kind of an interesting thing

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.420 
and that's kind of an interesting thing
i<00:01:14.670> noticed<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.450> i<00:01:15.509> unboxed<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> board<00:01:16.430> but

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
i noticed when i unboxed the board but

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
i noticed when i unboxed the board but
didn't<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.729> share<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> unboxing

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
didn't really share in the unboxing

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.609 
didn't really share in the unboxing
video<00:01:19.229> um<00:01:19.770> oh<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> first<00:01:22.380> thing<00:01:22.439> i<00:01:22.560> did

video um oh so the first thing i did

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
video um oh so the first thing i did
when<00:01:22.799> i<00:01:22.920> unbox<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> thing<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:24.420> void<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
when i unbox this thing was void the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.920 
when i unbox this thing was void the
warranty<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.320> uh<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:26.060> took<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> back<00:01:27.630> plate

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
warranty I uh I took off the back plate

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.249 
warranty I uh I took off the back plate
and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.380> install<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> brackets<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> am-3

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
and I install the brackets for the am-3

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
and I install the brackets for the am-3

does void the warranty for my cooling

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
does void the warranty for my cooling
unit<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.890> cooling<00:01:38.250> into
