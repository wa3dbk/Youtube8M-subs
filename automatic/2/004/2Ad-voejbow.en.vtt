00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and you close it like this so you don't

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.670 
and you close it like this so you don't
have<00:02:37.650> too<00:02:37.920> much<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.060> tip<00:02:39.440> showing<00:02:40.440> here

have too much of the tip showing here
okay<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.360> either<00:02:42.480> keep<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:42.900> hand<00:02:43.080> open

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459

and<00:02:45.230> strum<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.650> or<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.100> can<00:02:47.250> keep<00:02:47.370> it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
and strum like that or you can keep it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520 
and strum like that or you can keep it
close<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.300> that's<00:02:48.510> up<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
close like this that's up to you the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.770 
close like this that's up to you the
second<00:02:49.950> way<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.330> between

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
second way is to just have it between

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.780 
second way is to just have it between
your<00:02:52.170> index<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.709> your<00:02:52.860> thumb<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
your index and your thumb like this and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.670 
your index and your thumb like this and
never<00:02:54.390> hold<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.810> pic<00:02:54.959> like<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.410> think<00:02:55.470> is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
never hold a pic like this I think is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.030 
never hold a pic like this I think is
really<00:02:55.739> unstable<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:58.350> just<00:02:58.680> feels

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
really unstable because it just feels

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
really unstable because it just feels
unstable<00:02:59.370> but<00:02:59.760> Steve<00:03:00.030> Morse<00:03:00.330> holes<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.810> holds

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
unstable but Steve Morse holes it holds

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.290 
unstable but Steve Morse holes it holds
it<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.650> believe<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:01.980> or<00:03:02.070> not<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.209> it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
it like this believe it or not and so it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.420 
it like this believe it or not and so it
doesn't<00:03:03.630> know<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> Gallagher<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.980> course<00:03:05.190> it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
doesn't know a Gallagher so of course it

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
doesn't know a Gallagher so of course it
works<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.630> if<00:03:07.050> it's<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:07.800> you're<00:03:07.980> into

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
works if it's if it's what you're into

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.250 
works if it's if it's what you're into
thank<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.570> much<00:03:09.750> for<00:03:09.900> watching<00:03:09.930> this
