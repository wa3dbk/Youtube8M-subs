00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 of what character is clear combines 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:44.820

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 time to pursue this 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.870

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.020

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.849

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.490

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.560
