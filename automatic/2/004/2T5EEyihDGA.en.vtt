00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
play with once you straighten the unit

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.600 
play with once you straighten the unit
then<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.260> have<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.590> have<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.770> pretty<00:01:09.430> good

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
then you have to have a pretty good

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.649 
then you have to have a pretty good
wedge<00:01:09.880> under<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.790> GM<00:01:13.119> one<00:01:13.330> we<00:01:13.479> use<00:01:13.630> a

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
wedge under it and the GM one we use a

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.070 
wedge under it and the GM one we use a
stick<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.080> straighten<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.799> unit<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.869> can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
stick to straighten the unit so you can

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.140 
stick to straighten the unit so you can
just<00:01:17.259> order<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.619> stick<00:01:17.920> put<00:01:18.189> a<00:01:18.220> TKO<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.030> I'm

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
just order the stick put a TKO and I'm

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.330 
just order the stick put a TKO and I'm
early<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.009> 98<00:01:21.729> Camaro<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.860> that'll<00:01:24.130> put<00:01:24.310> the

early or a 98 Camaro and that'll put the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.080 
early or a 98 Camaro and that'll put the

stick in the correct position and this

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.700 
stick in the correct position and this
is<00:01:28.210> putting<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.509> five-speed<00:01:29.079> in<00:01:29.229> an<00:01:29.350> early
