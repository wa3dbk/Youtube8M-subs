carbon handle construction so I've been

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.300

hearing about the spin effect technology

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
hearing about the spin effect technology
for<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> while<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.720> really

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
for a while now and I was really

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
for a while now and I was really
interested<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> giving<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> try<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.030> seeing

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
interested in giving it a try and seeing

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
interested in giving it a try and seeing
if<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.080> cracked<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
if it was all it was cracked up to be

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.109 
if it was all it was cracked up to be
I<00:01:14.100> started<00:01:14.729> off<00:01:14.880> hitting<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.689> C<00:01:16.080> 99<00:01:16.680> s

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
I started off hitting with the C 99 s

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
I started off hitting with the C 99 s
again<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:19.110> concerned<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
again I was a little concerned with the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
again I was a little concerned with the
holes<00:01:20.220> extra<00:01:20.850> spin<00:01:21.030> concept<00:01:21.659> Wilson<00:01:22.080> actually

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
holes extra spin concept Wilson actually

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
holes extra spin concept Wilson actually
says<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.400> technology<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> like

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
says they the technology is like

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.420 
says they the technology is like
lowering<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> net<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.500> two<00:01:25.560> feet<00:01:26.009> meaning

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
lowering the net by two feet meaning

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
lowering the net by two feet meaning
you're<00:01:26.549> gonna<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.270> more

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you're gonna get that much more

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.300 
you're gonna get that much more
clearance<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.140> definitely<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
clearance I definitely don't have

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
clearance I definitely don't have
interest<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.970> reverting<00:01:30.450> back<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.930> 12<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
interest in reverting back to my 12 and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
interest in reverting back to my 12 and
under<00:01:31.409> girls<00:01:31.740> days<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.909> interested<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
under girls days so I was interested to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
under girls days so I was interested to
see<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.140> could<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.439> control<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
see if I could really control the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
see if I could really control the
driving<00:01:35.670> power<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.210> well<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> spin<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
driving power as well as the spin but I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.649 
driving power as well as the spin but I
was<00:01:37.770> pleasantly<00:01:38.220> surprised<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> 99

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
was pleasantly surprised with the 99

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
was pleasantly surprised with the 99
again<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> felt<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:40.920> once<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.280> got<00:01:41.460> used<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
again I felt like once I got used to it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
again I felt like once I got used to it
once<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.450> added<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.290> brushed<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
once I added a little bit more brushed a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
once I added a little bit more brushed a
little<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.220> low-to-high<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> my<00:01:44.909> stroke<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
little more low-to-high to my stroke I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.999 
little more low-to-high to my stroke I
felt<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.290> able<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> balls

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
felt like I was able to get the balls

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
felt like I was able to get the balls
nice<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> deep<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.600> had<00:01:48.750> power<00:01:48.990> -<00:01:49.380> they

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
nice and deep and they had power - they

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
nice and deep and they had power - they
weren't<00:01:49.799> sitting<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> concern

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
weren't sitting up which was a concern

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.929 
weren't sitting up which was a concern
for<00:01:52.049> me<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.439> racket<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:53.430> felt

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for me with this racket actually felt

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.700 
for me with this racket actually felt
really<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.750> volleys<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.259> well<00:01:55.439> this

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
really good on my volleys as well this

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.230 
really good on my volleys as well this
rack<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> obviously<00:01:56.460> geared<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:56.969> toward

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
rack is obviously geared more toward

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
rack is obviously geared more toward
baseliners<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.680> only<00:01:58.890> about<00:01:59.040> two

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
baseliners but it's only about two

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.069 
baseliners but it's only about two
points<00:01:59.670> headlight<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.360> makes<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.719> racket

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
points headlight which makes this racket

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.780 
points headlight which makes this racket
a<00:02:01.140> really

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
a really

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.760 
a really
racket<00:02:02.510> at<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.690> net<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:02.990> felt<00:02:03.200> like<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.410> had<00:02:03.590> good

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
racket at the net I felt like I had good

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.470 
racket at the net I felt like I had good
control<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.520> was<00:02:04.670> still<00:02:04.850> able<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.180> get<00:02:05.300> my

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
control and I was still able to get my

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.510 
control and I was still able to get my
ball<00:02:05.660> ace<00:02:05.810> nice<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:06.260> deep<00:02:06.410> same<00:02:07.100> thing<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.430> my

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
ball ace nice and deep same thing on my

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.240 
ball ace nice and deep same thing on my
overheads<00:02:08.030> again<00:02:08.960> on<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.350> serve<00:02:09.620> as<00:02:09.800> well<00:02:09.980> I

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
overheads again on the serve as well I

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.340 
overheads again on the serve as well I
felt<00:02:10.490> like<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.850> able<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.120> get<00:02:11.300> power<00:02:11.870> as

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
felt like I was able to get power as

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.440 
felt like I was able to get power as
well<00:02:12.620> as<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> spin<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.640> sometimes<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.270> feel

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
well as the spin and sometimes you feel

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.150 
well as the spin and sometimes you feel
like<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> technology<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.830> called

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
like with a technology like this called

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.650 
like with a technology like this called
spin<00:02:16.490> effect<00:02:16.790> you're<00:02:17.000> gonna<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.240> missing<00:02:17.540> out

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
spin effect you're gonna be missing out

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.570 
spin effect you're gonna be missing out
on<00:02:17.720> something<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.320> power<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.400> really

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
on something like power but that really

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670 
on something like power but that really
wasn't<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.060> case<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.810> 99

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
wasn't the case with the 99

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.100 
wasn't the case with the 99
now<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> 105's<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> bit<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.780> different

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
now the 105's is a bit of a different

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.320 
now the 105's is a bit of a different
story<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:25.010> felt<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.400> had<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> cannon<00:02:26.180> with

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
story I felt like I had a cannon with

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.970 
story I felt like I had a cannon with
this<00:02:26.480> racket<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.960> my<00:02:27.080> forehand<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.740> my

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this racket on my forehand in my

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.640 
this racket on my forehand in my
backhand<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.700> my<00:02:28.820> serve<00:02:29.060> which<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.230> usually<00:02:30.620> a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
backhand and my serve which is usually a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.530 
backhand and my serve which is usually a
great<00:02:30.800> thing<00:02:31.130> except<00:02:31.550> when<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.850> balls<00:02:32.030> are

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
great thing except when the balls are

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.080 
great thing except when the balls are
hitting<00:02:33.200> fence<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.220> definitely<00:02:34.580> took<00:02:34.700> me<00:02:34.880> some

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
hitting fence it definitely took me some

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.900 
hitting fence it definitely took me some
time<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:36.020> get<00:02:36.170> used<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.310> power<00:02:37.520> with<00:02:37.790> this

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
time to get used to the power with this

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.580 
time to get used to the power with this
racket<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.690> why<00:02:38.840> if<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.140> decide<00:02:39.440> to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
racket and that's why if you decide to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.350 
racket and that's why if you decide to
go<00:02:39.680> with<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.860> 105's<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.790> would<00:02:40.910> recommend

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
go with the 105's I would recommend

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.620 
go with the 105's I would recommend
going<00:02:41.930> with<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.170> string<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:43.180> Lux<00:02:44.180> elan<00:02:44.390> big

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
going with a string like Lux elan big

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.870 
going with a string like Lux elan big
banger<00:02:45.050> Babolat<00:02:45.650> RPM<00:02:46.070> blast<00:02:46.310> or<00:02:46.610> maybe<00:02:46.790> even

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
banger Babolat RPM blast or maybe even

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.940 
banger Babolat RPM blast or maybe even
techni<00:02:47.390> fibre<00:02:47.600> black<00:02:47.900> poly<00:02:48.350> string<00:02:48.770> will

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
techni fibre black poly string will

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.440 
techni fibre black poly string will
really<00:02:49.220> give<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.520> little<00:02:49.820> extra<00:02:50.060> control

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
really give you a little extra control

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.330 
really give you a little extra control
on<00:02:50.600> those<00:02:50.750> ground<00:02:50.990> strokes<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.920> once<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.220> got

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
on those ground strokes but once I got

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.070 
on those ground strokes but once I got
my<00:02:52.490> rhythm<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.940> was<00:02:53.090> able<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.360> add<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.840> little

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
my rhythm I was able to add in a little

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.950 
my rhythm I was able to add in a little
more<00:02:54.170> brush<00:02:54.410> up<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.650> back<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.040> ball<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
more brush up the back of the ball I

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.360 
more brush up the back of the ball I
definitely<00:02:56.960> felt<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.470> had<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.710> whole<00:02:58.160> lot

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
definitely felt like I had a whole lot

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.310 
definitely felt like I had a whole lot
of<00:02:58.430> clearance<00:02:58.910> with<00:02:59.270> this<00:02:59.390> racket<00:02:59.810> which<00:02:59.960> is<00:03:00.140> a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
of clearance with this racket which is a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.170 
of clearance with this racket which is a
good<00:03:00.800> thing<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.520> also<00:03:01.700> want<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.000> make

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
good thing but you also want to make

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.580 
good thing but you also want to make
sure<00:03:02.300> you're<00:03:02.480> balancing<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.080> with<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.350> lot<00:03:03.560> of

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
sure you're balancing that with a lot of

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.290 
sure you're balancing that with a lot of
forward<00:03:03.950> movement<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> lot<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.850> Drive<00:03:05.090> as

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
forward movement and a lot of Drive as

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.699 
forward movement and a lot of Drive as
well<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.840> don't<00:03:05.990> have<00:03:06.110> balls<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.620> are

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
well so you don't have balls that are

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.520 
well so you don't have balls that are
sitting<00:03:06.890> up<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.400> felt<00:03:08.060> like<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:08.690> was<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.050> really

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
sitting up I felt like it was a really

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.470 
sitting up I felt like it was a really
great<00:03:09.650> racket<00:03:10.160> for<00:03:10.340> my<00:03:10.430> slice<00:03:10.850> that's

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
great racket for my slice that's

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.900 
great racket for my slice that's
something<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.900> wasn't<00:03:12.140> really<00:03:12.440> expecting

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
something I wasn't really expecting

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.250 
something I wasn't really expecting
apparently<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.090> spin<00:03:14.360> effect<00:03:14.690> technology

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
apparently the spin effect technology

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.680 
apparently the spin effect technology
works<00:03:16.010> with<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.520> backspin<00:03:16.970> as<00:03:17.180> well<00:03:17.390> as<00:03:17.570> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
works with the backspin as well as the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.900 
works with the backspin as well as the
topspin<00:03:18.170> at<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.130> net<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.340> felt<00:03:19.730> really

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
topspin at the net I felt really

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.479 
topspin at the net I felt really
comfortable<00:03:20.180> again<00:03:21.080> like<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.470> 99s<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.459> a

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
comfortable again like the 99s this is a

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.280 
comfortable again like the 99s this is a
pretty<00:03:23.030> sturdy<00:03:23.330> racquet<00:03:23.780> up<00:03:23.870> at<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.020> net<00:03:24.170> it's

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
pretty sturdy racquet up at the net it's

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.160 
pretty sturdy racquet up at the net it's
slightly<00:03:24.590> more<00:03:24.739> headlight<00:03:25.340> than<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.730> 99s<00:03:26.450> but

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
slightly more headlight than the 99s but

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.350 
slightly more headlight than the 99s but
my<00:03:27.739> volleys<00:03:28.130> felt<00:03:28.370> really<00:03:28.580> consistent<00:03:29.239> and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
my volleys felt really consistent and

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
my volleys felt really consistent and
solid<00:03:29.780> felt<00:03:30.500> like<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.709> had<00:03:30.800> a<00:03:30.860> ton<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.190> power<00:03:31.520> on

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
solid felt like I had a ton of power on

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.090 
solid felt like I had a ton of power on
my<00:03:31.880> overhead<00:03:32.330> same<00:03:32.720> thing<00:03:32.959> on<00:03:33.080> my<00:03:33.200> serve<00:03:33.440> which

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
my overhead same thing on my serve which

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.010 
my overhead same thing on my serve which
is<00:03:34.250> again<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.520> great<00:03:34.760> thing<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.630> really

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
is again a great thing but you really

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.220 
is again a great thing but you really
have<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.350> hone<00:03:36.590> in

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
have to hone in

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.830 
have to hone in
on<00:03:37.290> your<00:03:37.680> targets<00:03:38.190> that's<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.910> huge<00:03:39.239> thing<00:03:39.540> with

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
on your targets that's a huge thing with

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.500 
on your targets that's a huge thing with
this<00:03:40.200> racket<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.680> particular<00:03:41.480> overall<00:03:42.480> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
this racket in particular overall I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.030 
this racket in particular overall I
really<00:03:42.900> felt<00:03:43.140> like<00:03:43.170> these<00:03:43.379> rackets<00:03:43.769> had<00:03:44.010> a

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
really felt like these rackets had a

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.070 
really felt like these rackets had a
worthwhile<00:03:44.550> technology<00:03:45.420> that's<00:03:45.629> probably

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
worthwhile technology that's probably

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.420 
worthwhile technology that's probably
going<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.290> affect<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.830> rackets<00:03:47.310> are

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
going to affect the way that rackets are

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.400 
going to affect the way that rackets are
manufactured<00:03:48.060> from<00:03:48.209> here<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.540> out<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:49.290> as

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
manufactured from here on out but as

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.280 
manufactured from here on out but as
great<00:03:49.650> as<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> spin<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:51.000> not<00:03:51.290> everything

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
great as the spin is it's not everything

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.740 
great as the spin is it's not everything
you<00:03:52.500> really<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.430> some<00:03:53.610> drive<00:03:53.880> along

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
you really have to have some drive along

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.600 
you really have to have some drive along
with<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.019> spin<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.290> have<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> complete<00:03:56.040> game<00:03:56.310> I

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
with the spin to have a complete game I

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.580 
with the spin to have a complete game I
will<00:03:57.269> say<00:03:57.480> both<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.930> these<00:03:58.019> rockets<00:03:58.440> have

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
will say both of these rockets have

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.250 
will say both of these rockets have
ample<00:03:59.040> appeal<00:03:59.280> since<00:03:59.519> 360<00:04:00.180> technology<00:04:01.140> and

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
ample appeal since 360 technology and

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.900 
ample appeal since 360 technology and
the<00:04:01.319> handle<00:04:01.709> which<00:04:02.069> it's<00:04:02.430> hard<00:04:02.489> for<00:04:02.760> me<00:04:02.819> to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
the handle which it's hard for me to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.250 
the handle which it's hard for me to
compare<00:04:03.269> because<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.630> didn't<00:04:03.840> play<00:04:04.019> with<00:04:04.049> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
compare because I didn't play with the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.350 
compare because I didn't play with the
previous<00:04:04.620> version<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.190> steam<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:06.090> it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
previous version of the steam but it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180 
previous version of the steam but it
felt<00:04:06.599> really<00:04:06.900> really<00:04:07.170> good<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.680> my<00:04:07.830> elbow<00:04:08.160> and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190
