shape<00:03:51.820> by<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.180> kind<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.390> extending<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.380> top

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
shape by just kind of extending the top

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.860 
shape by just kind of extending the top
in<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.980> very<00:03:54.190> triangular<00:03:55.030> shape<00:03:55.360> as<00:03:55.570> you<00:03:55.720> can

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
in a very triangular shape as you can

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.320 
in a very triangular shape as you can
see<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.530> I'm<00:03:56.620> using<00:03:56.799> just<00:03:56.950> an<00:03:57.250> eyebrow<00:03:57.489> pencil

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
see so I'm using just an eyebrow pencil

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.410 
see so I'm using just an eyebrow pencil
from<00:03:58.989> Mac<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.739> just<00:04:00.190> outlining<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.970> first<00:04:01.239> and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
from Mac and just outlining it first and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.400 
from Mac and just outlining it first and
then<00:04:01.570> filling<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.140> in<00:04:02.200> with<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.190> product

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
then filling that in with that product

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.890 
then filling that in with that product
and<00:04:05.410> then<00:04:05.829> I<00:04:05.890> used<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.340> brow<00:04:06.850> powder<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.540> dark

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
and then I used a brow powder in a dark

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.110 
and then I used a brow powder in a dark
brown<00:04:08.290> color<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:09.100> also<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.700> little<00:04:09.850> bit<00:04:10.000> of

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
brown color and also a little bit of

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.030 
brown color and also a little bit of
black<00:04:10.269> just<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.690> fill<00:04:11.079> in<00:04:11.290> those<00:04:11.470> brows<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.799> bit

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
black just to fill in those brows a bit

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.890 
black just to fill in those brows a bit
further<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:13.120> there<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:13.420> should<00:04:13.480> have<00:04:13.630> those

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
further so there you should have those

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.770 
further so there you should have those
very<00:04:14.200> pointy<00:04:14.709> Maleficent<00:04:15.430> brows<00:04:15.700> so<00:04:16.450> now<00:04:16.720> for

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
very pointy Maleficent brows so now for

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.080

but I am gonna show you how to contour
very<00:04:27.580> strongly<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:29.140> first<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.560> used<00:04:29.770> actually<00:04:30.130> a

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
very strongly so first I used actually a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.040 
very strongly so first I used actually a
cream<00:04:30.550> pigment<00:04:31.030> by<00:04:31.150> Illamasqua<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:32.020> a

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
cream pigment by Illamasqua on a

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.590 
cream pigment by Illamasqua on a
foundation<00:04:32.710> brush<00:04:32.979> and<00:04:33.160> then<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:33.669> just<00:04:33.940> kind<00:04:34.540> of

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
foundation brush and then I just kind of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.750 
foundation brush and then I just kind of
shaped<00:04:35.110> out<00:04:35.380> where<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.770> want<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.310> contour<00:04:36.700> to

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
shaped out where I want the contour to

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.790 
shaped out where I want the contour to
go<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.690> obviously<00:04:38.110> gonna<00:04:38.290> look<00:04:38.470> quite

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
go this is obviously gonna look quite

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.760 
go this is obviously gonna look quite
sort<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.430> natural<00:04:40.360> contour<00:04:41.110> but<00:04:41.590> that's

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
sort of a natural contour but that's

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.560 
sort of a natural contour but that's
kind<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.039> what<00:04:42.130> I'm<00:04:42.250> going<00:04:42.580> for<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:43.120> then<00:04:43.510> I

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
kind of what I'm going for and then I

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.020 
kind of what I'm going for and then I
just<00:04:43.720> blended<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.200> out<00:04:44.470> with<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.950> damp<00:04:45.280> makeup

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
just blended that out with a damp makeup

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.880 
just blended that out with a damp makeup
sponge<00:04:46.390> just<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.750> blend<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.289> in<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.530> bit<00:04:47.710> better

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
sponge just to blend it in a bit better

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.850 
sponge just to blend it in a bit better
and<00:04:48.220> then<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:49.030> make<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.390> edge<00:04:49.630> very<00:04:50.229> sharp<00:04:50.680> I

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
and then to make that edge very sharp I

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.070 
and then to make that edge very sharp I
used<00:04:51.070> some<00:04:51.310> concealer<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.270> use<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.900> other

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
used some concealer and use the other

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.960 
used some concealer and use the other
side<00:04:53.169> of<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.560> sponge<00:04:54.010> just<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.610> kind<00:04:54.849> of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
side of that sponge just to kind of

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.370 
side of that sponge just to kind of
create<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.390> very<00:04:55.720> sharp<00:04:56.080> edge<00:05:00.960> then<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:01.990> went

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
create a very sharp edge then I went

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.230 
create a very sharp edge then I went
ahead<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.770> set<00:05:03.099> that<00:05:03.370> product<00:05:03.820> with<00:05:04.000> some

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
ahead and set that product with some

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240 
ahead and set that product with some
powder<00:05:04.630> because<00:05:05.169> this<00:05:05.320> is<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> cream<00:05:05.800> product

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
you put other powders on top so then I

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.270 
you put other powders on top so then I
use<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.180> contouring<00:05:10.960> powder<00:05:11.229> by<00:05:11.860> Ben<00:05:12.250> Nye

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.370 
and it's kind of a grayish brown shade
and<00:05:14.710> used<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.720> contouring<00:05:16.720> brush<00:05:16.900> just<00:05:17.260> to

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
and used a contouring brush just to

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.589 
and used a contouring brush just to
really<00:05:17.919> deepen<00:05:18.340> up<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.789> contour<00:05:19.270> even

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
really deepen up that contour even

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.480 
really deepen up that contour even

further and make it look a bit darker

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.240 
further and make it look a bit darker
and<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:22.030> also<00:05:22.270> used<00:05:22.720> this<00:05:23.260> eyeshadow<00:05:23.830> which<00:05:24.130> is

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250

and I also used this eyeshadow which is
in<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.430> greyish<00:05:24.910> color<00:05:25.240> because<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:25.870> contour

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
in a greyish color because that contour

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.010 
in a greyish color because that contour
looks<00:05:26.830> quite<00:05:27.160> grey<00:05:27.550> on<00:05:27.760> Angelina<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.780> that's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
looks quite grey on Angelina so that's

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.710 
looks quite grey on Angelina so that's
