00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.129

 I have a very bad message 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.420
 I have you from my super duper 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.600
 this mix another well, and now is more 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.430
 something very bad happened 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.340
 and I made mashed potatoes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.670
 vegas mashed potato totally healthy 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.770
 yes and then the mixer started here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.770
 smoke and it is no longer on 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 So that's what I've got from kitchenette and myself 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 so highly praised and I needed him now 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.909
 Exchange does not know what's there either 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.369
 does this happen then is not quite 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.430
 properly if it is flashing press here 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.920
 all at once everything stops and no longer 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.460
 it does not matter at all 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.250
 it's so shitty and now I can 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.649
 no professionals do not mix muslim 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.119

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.119
 but I need it soon 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.800
 Shit so nonsense on everyone 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 In case you always keep it on the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.830
 current 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.780
 why is that more after that? 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.560
 that's for one is a lot 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.200
 performance of the hbla blog i found him like this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 cool I mean by the look it is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.300
 simply the ride beats all now 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.710
 Have to see if I still have it 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.289

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.670
 other son replacement mixa so the look 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.550
 I'm definitely different now 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.380
 I recommend you also replacement mixa 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.160
 if you fail one and the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.230
 absolutely want to make a recipe 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.209
 it's also great music for the morning 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.150
 for those who are not that fast or so 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.360
 can already eat a lot in the morning 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.709
 vital for the six and as well 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.120
 to stimulate the metabolism nicely 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.340
 eat something directly in the morning 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.380
 yes and I got you from the mashed potatoes 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.019
 told that here I did it 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.780
 has become super nice creamy 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:43.650
 I show so it is so creamy here all 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.900
 creamy and it tastes much better 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.930
 as normal cow's milk in it or have 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.320
 normal mother there is no butter in it 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.120
 and no cow milk yes if the recipe 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.280
 so it is also great 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.920
 This recipe tasted great if that 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.260
 recipe is desired when does it write in 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.700
 the comments here under the video and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.640
 then there is the recipe for this 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.310
 For example, have nine mixa and tell me how 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.989
 you will find a vegan mashed potatoes 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.960

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.880
 yes 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.370
 that's my bad news and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.530

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.690
