00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to another episode of terror 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 to the extreme 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.170
 Good people today would be counting here. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.460
 just the miki black side and the spirit 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.920
 magical the enem in 1998 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.199
 I was turning up just tone on Saturday 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
 while my parents were going to do the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.810
 of the month when I came across a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.429
 old cassette box 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.470
 curiously I open the box for 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.590
 find a bunch of old 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.610
 vhs recorded with different programs and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.399
 movies 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.149
 but only one cell ribbon called 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.440
 pay attention to me because of the familiar face 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.719
 her name was miki and the magic mirror in the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.960
 cover was mickey mouse with donald 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.170
 Goofy and bother there was something different 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.899
 on their facial expressions Cover 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 Mrs. Edith gets very depressed and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 was sitting on the floor holding 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.809
 own legs 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.689
 Goofy was on top of the fur boat 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.479
 pet and had a very angry look 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.510
 with the air and one of his shoes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.570
 time and pet was hanging from the side of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.150
 out of the boat with his two hands in 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.790
 rails trying to get up and your face 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.320
 I was with the woman very depressed but 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.299
 despite all this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 mick because it really called my 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.390
 attention 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.960
 he was sitting on a pile of 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.060
 screen with evil smile on face standing 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.360
 it was outside the back 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.890
 of hay and me that was holding big 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.659
 fork with the tennis shoe jewelry lei 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 said I was younger with it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 happened and that everything was black and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.759
 white both the cover and the film 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 I had no idea what could be 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.430
 I really wanted to watched then 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.270
 I closed the box the hip gate and put the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.549
 tape on the video cassette cool to start 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 for about two minutes episode that the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.040
 episode has a black screen with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.350
 sounds of waves resurfacing 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.100
 then an image of me that appears in the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.410
 screen 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.500
 I had never seen that picture before. 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.990
 he was half- arms crossed 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.610
 a skull and crossbones with a 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.820
 smile on face 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.210
 then it disappears and the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.880
 title finally emerged began as 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.580
 one day with a clay boat being 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.190
 pulled by him to the harbor and boat 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.040
 I was very nervous until I ran too 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.740
 Barn and starts yelling at breath is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.350
 no reason and simply 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.060
 pushed out of the way but never 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.370
 the goofy fall in the water 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.190
 the video says it twists for a couple of seconds 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.310
 and goofy running out of barn 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.280
 again only this time he runs 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.560
 for the breath he grabs this cotel for the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.350
 wall of the granary making a 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.250
 pile of hay fell off the roof tending 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.489
 I walk up to him and the camera gives 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.440
 a closeup on the potato face that what 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.220
 It shows a black ba expression gilds 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.940
 of hate 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.980
 I had never seen it like that in years. 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.590
 when it comes up to a lot of pity the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.959
 screen goes black for a few seconds 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.600
 then a text appears saying 10 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.269
 minutes ago and that fine for the minc 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.620
 on a hill with a goofy o'dowd 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.810
 looking at the mirror 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.489
 all three are with an expression of 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.160
 fear and their faces 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.110
 Minc comes near the mirror and a thunderbolt 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.570
 hit the glass and shattered in 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.630
 direction to all 3,000 teams by 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.360
 They look good but owners start to evaluate 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.730
 to bring up to fall from the hill 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.989
 the story video again and you 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.120
 hear a laugh 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.940
 the screen shows broken mirror again 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.860
 and you see the shards of glass that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.650
 will break in the mirror will shine 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.860
 strongly dark very dark 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.350
 then returned to normal me 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.290
 look around and see with the land down 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.209
 the mountain running after me 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.970
 look back at the mirror 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.580
 but when does it 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.190
 the claw is too big and pulled 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.980
 in and a few seconds later it leaves 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.489
 there a more macabre and destroyed version 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.070
 bic your clothes are more torn and he is 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.630
 almost a beast with bulging eyes and 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.270
 sharp teeth 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.730
 the screen changes to show the goofy who 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.370
 is running down hill and ends up 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.720
 stumbling from a rock toward the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.050
 City 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.950
 now you see it you hear it all cut 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.140
 in Greek 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.950
 then it is dragged by someone 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.190
 Can not you see who's the silent scene? 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.580
 to show the in 38 you read where 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.040
 find the mac and the mirror where 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.350
 he jumps in front of the mirror a light 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.560
 bright and by a hooded figure 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.810
 was a late version of donald and 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.140
 soon after macabre version of the goofy 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.110
 leave the mirror all three begin to 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.230
 walk in a circle and until it starts to 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.870
 become static a few shortly after 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.690
 all you can hear whispers 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.650
 lows and footsteps for about five 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.070
 minutes 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.710
 then the screen shows the words 15 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.870
 minutes later and shows the paper is 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.880
 covered by a dripping dark liquid 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.450
 spread everywhere 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.240
 nick tonton burns bar with a thigh and 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.030
 all 3 way to the middle of the area 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.520
 all look intensely at screen like 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.500
 if you were observing and 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.870
 walk towards me while 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.080
 walked their eyes, they kept getting 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.400
 larger and more penetrating until 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.650
 explanations 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.560
 the claws and the beak from the side of here in 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.680
 you just give your teeth a lot of foam 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.380
 the buzzing goes back but this time it's very 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.020
 and you could see the city that 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.600
 mother that the bottom of the screen a tomb too 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.950
 was behind them and there was a name 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.230
 joining joÃ£o bafo de oz 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.990
 even assign a little until suddenly 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.930
 the tomb sport on fire and a hand 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.970
 black get out of I jumped from my 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.190
 I pushed the TV out of the 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.440
 closet causing it to break 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.200
 stop the video just before 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.330
 characters came to the screen but listening 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.120
 was touching my mind the rest 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.670
 that day I took an ita and all the 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.200
 other than the box that not everything that stops 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.840
 was not obliged to finish 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.460
 watch the 11 most cited 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.100
 the last thing I remember seeing 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.480
 before burning the citations her the cover of the 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.240
 mickey mouse video 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.830
 he was different this time showed 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.140
 a photo of the macabre characters 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.360
 truck fun 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.550
 I can never forget your 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.430
 smile of people marked by a 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.980
 fixedly for me that vision invaded 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.980
 my dreams until now and the parents and friends 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.350
 They never believed whenever they spoke. 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.540
 about an experience for islands 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.560
 unfortunately there is no way to prove 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.900
 the opposite 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.100
 but in a way I'm happy is that 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:16.070
 thing is destroyed now I'm happy 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.470
 with that thing is excluded water 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.419
 personal that you found in our new 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.929
 stun team 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:29.549
 neurosis said that he had a lot of 

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:31.659
 to do with this side of the continuum and 

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.669
 participated in various rituals of magic 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:37.449
 black 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.519
 now we will never know whether or not this 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.129
 It's really true, it 's a lie. 

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:47.669
 but one thing we at least have 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:49.239
 sure that these things can 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:52.419
 to happen 

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:55.110
 there have been reports of people 

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:58.149
 by this same experience 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:01.329
 unfortunately this episode is lost 

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:04.449
 and I never uploaded any information from him 

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:06.069
 so if you know where I can have 

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:08.799
 this episode 

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.939
