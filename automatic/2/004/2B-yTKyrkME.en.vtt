00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hi everyone! 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.589
 today I came here to answer some 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.110
 doubts that you who enjoy our 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.110
 post on facebook from here 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 valdirene you make white coverage 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 makes lights in your hair and has allergies 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.810
 ammonia 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.430
 the first suggestion for readiness 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 white cover instead of using 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 change the color 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.369
 is a product without ammonia. 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.650
 consequently you will get a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.120
 white coverage without harming and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.520
 case of an allergy 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 for the reflex product all the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 products to whiten hair has to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.550
 woman a suggestion that you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 can not have contact with this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.719
 product on your scalp with your 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 skin is to make those lights with paper 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 the fact that you protect the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 hair on foil 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 he will not have contact with your leather 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.100
 hairy therefore the action will be 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.890
 only in the hair but the white cover 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.890
 switch color by toner 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.710
 gabriela really the excess of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.450
 hydration never happens 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.460
 by the characteristic that you do not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.229
 signed up you are with many strands 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.460
 many people confuse 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.810
 new hair with broken hair is 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.540
 happens in the process of falling 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.100
 hair an exchange then so you get 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.920
 to lose hair when you wash 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 it falls but it also begins to be born that the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.299
 fact that these new yarns have no 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 they lift in the middle of the hair and gives 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.720
 impression of a broken hair 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.820
 The first tip I give you that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 identify if your hair is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.689
 actually breaking or if you are with 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 a constant exchange of your hair 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.680
 you are falling too much in the sink 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 recommended in the bathroom in case your 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.659
 House 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.430
 I recommend that you look for a good one. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.619
 dermatologist to take a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.509
 blood to see how your rates are 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.070
 through china to see if it is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.130
 everything which in the body and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.110
 hair is falling now break through 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.579
 hydration reason this never happens 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 You have to invest in your house. You 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.750
 He's not passing a chap and then 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.610
 You may be breaking your hair. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.710
 not 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:13.340
 swimming but when it's time to end your 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:15.260
 hair was now you're complaining 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.970
 volume of your hair you have bunch 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.810
 likes the dog but does not like the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.550
 volume 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.860
 all these botox procedures 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.330
 alignment and all these names 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.240
 Are you really going to make one? 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.730
 chemical process of volume reduction in 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.590
 you can lower up to 30% of the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.140
 Volume so I'll explain to you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.270
 Peaked hair which is a peaked 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.120
 When you make layers you will have 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.010
 more volume and the shredder is when 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.500
 professional cuts inside the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.209
 hair you can take and I'll tell you 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.489
 who has hair cutting techniques 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.600
 you can reduce up to 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.430
 30% of the lateral volume without losing the cluster 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.870
 so my suggestion is in this for you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 try to find a good professional who 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.910
 cut curly hair and then yes 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.680
 control the volume of your hair with 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.379
 not cut with chemistry 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.379
 [Music] 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.760
 aline you let your natural hair not 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.670
 necessarily its progressive will 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.770
 have an effect is shorter what goes 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.870
 determine the durability of your brush 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.750
 progressive will be if you wash all 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.790
 the days to wash you every day 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.590
 anticipates to be done 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.810
 milestones to actually its progressive 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.500
 will last a long time - and mainly use 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.740
 Shampoos together as shampoo 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.570
 deep cleansing cleansing shampoo and so forth 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.459
 yes you remove some of that brush 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.800
 Progressive then to your brush 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.050
 progressive to last the most ideal is not 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.520
 wash every day to be careful 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.520
 with a funk and with frames 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.560
 this is already a case of a method one 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.660
 health professional then my 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.730
 suggestion for a dermatologist 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.070
 first to identify your 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 his cloak until the curious caste 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.260
 bacterial drought then the first step 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.670
 go to the doctor so he can guide you 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.340
 Will not you be spending too much? 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.110
 money with many fields is anti dandruff 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.480
 ante fall and will not result 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.190
 then no longer spend your buck 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:19.090
 in a correct way 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:20.830
 look for a dermatologist left but 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.940
 you've had a process of relaxation and 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.340
 your hair is falling a lot 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.169
 have probably had some sort of 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.720
 incompatibilities it is having 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.729
 a break because of this relaxation 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.200
 so the first tip I give is not 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.990
 repeat this smoothing of the last 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.190
 mark you did that you had the problem and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.050
 now your hair is very 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.169
 you need to go through a 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.120
 process of preference reconstruction 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.330
 to buy products based on 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 keratin shampoo and masks what the china 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.169
 will do it again she will give it all back 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.300
 what your hair lost because of 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.200
 of relaxation and your hair will stay 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.729
 firmer 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.350
 consequently it will stop 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.550
 break and if you have any questions 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.470
 about hair 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.910
 send your question to facebook 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.699
 From here, a kiss until the next 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.699
