have minimal me on door homes and then

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.660 
have minimal me on door homes and then
you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> areas<00:01:27.360> most<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> areas<00:01:28.439> around

you have areas most of the areas around

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.770 
you have areas most of the areas around
300,000<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> determine<00:01:30.509> okay<00:01:30.600> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
300,000 right so you determine okay so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.010 
300,000 right so you determine okay so
the<00:01:31.049> median<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> around<00:01:31.710> 250-300<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:33.020> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the median is around 250-300 right now

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.179 
the median is around 250-300 right now
you're<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.560> those<00:01:34.710> neighborhoods

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you're going to be those neighborhoods

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
you're going to be those neighborhoods
where<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.270> medium<00:01:36.720> plus<00:01:36.960> minus<00:01:37.200> fifty

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
where you have medium plus minus fifty

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.890 
where you have medium plus minus fifty
percent<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.240> geographical

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
percent right so that's the geographical

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.460 
percent right so that's the geographical
area<00:01:40.490> now<00:01:41.490> how<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> decide<00:01:42.390> maybe<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
area now how do you decide maybe you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.649 
area now how do you decide maybe you
know<00:01:43.619> maybe<00:01:43.829> million<00:01:44.490> people<00:01:44.909> population<00:01:45.060> may

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
know maybe million people population may

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
know maybe million people population may
be<00:01:45.720> allowed<00:01:46.320> by<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> big<00:01:47.220> part<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
be allowed by you know a big part of the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.090 
be allowed by you know a big part of the
city<00:01:48.030> fits<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> criteria<00:01:48.829> then<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> go

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
city fits that criteria then you go

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.789 
city fits that criteria then you go
further<00:01:50.430> by<00:01:51.119> looking<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.689> what's<00:01:52.079> also<00:01:52.350> most

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
further by looking at what's also most

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
further by looking at what's also most
convenient<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.549> what's<00:01:54.390> closest<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
convenient for you what's closest to

convenient for you what's closest to
your<00:01:55.439> office<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.520> too<00:01:56.790> far<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.270> drive

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
your office so it's not too far to drive

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
your office so it's not too far to drive
there<00:01:57.750> right<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> usually<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.549> 30

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
there right so I usually like to be 30

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
there right so I usually like to be 30
minutes<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.210> drive<00:02:00.479> distance<00:02:00.869> from<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.140> office

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
minutes to drive distance from my office

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
minutes to drive distance from my office
but<00:02:01.979> obviously<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.820> some<00:02:02.969> cases

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
but obviously I know in some cases

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
but obviously I know in some cases
especially<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.140> J<00:02:04.350> that's<00:02:04.969> not

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
especially I think we J that's not

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.469 
especially I think we J that's not
possible<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.879> find

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
possible right so so then you find

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.029 
possible right so so then you find
something<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.929> closer<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.530> then

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
something that's closer to you then

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.850 
something that's closer to you then
obviously<00:02:11.310> quality<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> housing

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
obviously quality of the housing

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
obviously quality of the housing
you<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.550> most<00:02:14.850> people<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:16.140> nice

drive around and you see and you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.360 
drive around and you see and you

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
be closer to that so helps to get some

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
be closer to that so helps to get some
news<00:02:48.570> because<00:02:49.020> if<00:02:49.170> some<00:02:49.320> companies<00:02:49.800> coming<00:02:50.160> in

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
town in the building the plant and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.960 
town in the building the plant and
they're<00:02:52.709> going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> employ<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> lot<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.580> people

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
they're going to employ a lot of people

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
they're going to employ a lot of people
then<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.600> know<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.350> those<00:02:55.500> people<00:02:55.530> will

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
then you know that those people will

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.220 
then you know that those people will
want<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.280> live<00:02:56.459> closer<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.330> their<00:02:57.660> employment

want to live closer to their employment

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.290 
want to live closer to their employment
so<00:02:58.770> at<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:58.980> point<00:02:59.040> obviously<00:02:59.550> better<00:03:00.060> off

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
so at that point obviously better off

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.540 
so at that point obviously better off
targeting<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.290> neighborhoods<00:03:02.010> closer<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
targeting the neighborhoods closer to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.600 
targeting the neighborhoods closer to
that<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.690> would<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.870> also<00:03:04.190> now<00:03:05.190> couple

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
that so that would be also now couple

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.550 
that so that would be also now couple
other<00:03:05.700> indicators<00:03:06.330> are<00:03:06.510> how<00:03:06.989> high<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
other indicators are how high is the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440 
other indicators are how high is the
foreclosure<00:03:07.920> rate<00:03:08.160> you'll<00:03:09.030> be<00:03:09.209> able<00:03:09.300> to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
foreclosure rate you'll be able to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.640 
foreclosure rate you'll be able to
notice<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.440> drive

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
notice that because when you drive

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.410 
notice that because when you drive
around<00:03:10.800> if<00:03:11.310> there's<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.610> lot<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.820> abandoned
