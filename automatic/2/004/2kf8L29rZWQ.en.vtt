for<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> brief<00:00:18.330> time<00:00:18.359> now<00:00:19.230> let's<00:00:19.410> take<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> look

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
for a brief time now let's take a look

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.759 
for a brief time now let's take a look
at<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.550> dinosaur<00:00:21.090> first<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
at the dinosaur first so here is a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
at the dinosaur first so here is a
Pteranodon<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.699> while<00:00:24.029> he<00:00:24.180> isn't<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.600> any

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
Pteranodon and while he isn't using any

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.349 
Pteranodon and while he isn't using any
new<00:00:25.080> molds<00:00:25.560> he<00:00:26.189> uses<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> 2012

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
new molds he uses actually the 2012

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.009 
new molds he uses actually the 2012
system<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.109> dinosaur<00:00:28.800> molds<00:00:29.220> his<00:00:29.970> design<00:00:30.689> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
system of dinosaur molds his design is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
system of dinosaur molds his design is
actually<00:00:31.199> new<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> terms<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> colouring

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually new in terms of the colouring

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
actually new in terms of the colouring
of<00:00:32.640> everything<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:34.170> pretty

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
of everything like that so that's pretty

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
of everything like that so that's pretty
interesting<00:00:34.500> because<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.309> has<00:00:35.430> more<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
interesting because it has more of a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330 
interesting because it has more of a
realistic<00:00:36.210> tone<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.719> guess<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.170> say<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.800> 2012

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
realistic tone I guess then say the 2012

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.180 
realistic tone I guess then say the 2012
dino<00:00:38.579> line<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.420> opinion<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.890> matches

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
dino line in my opinion and it matches

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.729 
dino line in my opinion and it matches
the<00:00:41.760> look<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> film<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.410> from<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.649> I've

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the look in the film just from what I've

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
the look in the film just from what I've
seen<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> trailers<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.329> some

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
seen in the trailers but you got some

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.180 
seen in the trailers but you got some
nice<00:00:45.570> printing<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.680> face<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.129> there

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
nice printing on the face right there

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.100 
nice printing on the face right there
which<00:00:47.610> came<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:48.480> cool<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.870> how

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
which came out pretty cool I like how

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.840 
which came out pretty cool I like how
that<00:00:49.170> came<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.160> these<00:00:50.250> wings<00:00:50.579> have

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that came out and then these wings have

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.029 
that came out and then these wings have
this<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.300> nice<00:00:51.660> blend<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.440> colors<00:00:52.829> where

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this really nice blend of colors where

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.380 
this really nice blend of colors where
you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> dark<00:00:53.670> red<00:00:53.789> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> blending

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you have this dark red kind of blending

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.290 
you have this dark red kind of blending
into<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> gray<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.949> winged<00:00:56.129> actual<00:00:56.850> material

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
into the gray the winged actual material

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
into the gray the winged actual material
is<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> soft<00:00:58.140> plastic<00:00:58.379> it's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is a very kind of soft plastic it's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
is a very kind of soft plastic it's
interesting<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.699> how<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.879> came<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
interesting on how that came out and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
interesting on how that came out and
those<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.140> clip<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> sides<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
those just clip to the sides like that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.179 
those just clip to the sides like that
and<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:04.019> means<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> move<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and that means you can move them up and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.539 
and that means you can move them up and
down<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:07.229> far<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
down and pretty far up and down which is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.480 
down and pretty far up and down which is
pretty<00:01:08.700> cool<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.619> whole<00:01:10.830> design<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
pretty cool and the whole design of it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
pretty cool and the whole design of it
is<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.939> made<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.330> five<00:01:12.659> pieces<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
is actually made out of five pieces you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
is actually made out of five pieces you
have<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.650> body<00:01:13.950> part<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> middle<00:01:14.820> then

you have this face kind of upper face
part<00:01:17.850> which<00:01:18.240> connects<00:01:18.869> through<00:01:19.080> those<00:01:19.229> little

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
part which connects through those little

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
part which connects through those little
pins<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.180> mouth

pins right there and you have this mouth

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.149 
pins right there and you have this mouth
part<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:21.960> connects<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.740> has<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> rod

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
part which connects actually has a rod

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.120 
part which connects actually has a rod
inside<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.420> face<00:01:24.630> part<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.619> body<00:01:25.799> part

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
inside the face part and the body part

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
inside the face part and the body part
and<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:26.939> actually<00:01:27.060> move<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and you could actually move it up and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.929 
and you could actually move it up and
down<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.500> bit<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.400> little<00:01:29.850> bit

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
down just a little bit and a little bit

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
down just a little bit and a little bit
around<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> rubber<00:01:31.110> piece<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
around because it is a rubber piece and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.319 
around because it is a rubber piece and
at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> mouth<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> could<00:01:32.640> move<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> down

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
at the mouth you could move up and down

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.609 
at the mouth you could move up and down
quite<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.470> bit<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.220> pretty<00:01:35.520> cool<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
quite a bit which is pretty cool and

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.870 
quite a bit which is pretty cool and
then<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> wings<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.729> said

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
then for the wings you know like I said

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
then for the wings you know like I said
it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> softer<00:01:39.720> plastic<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.200> you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's a kind of a softer plastic that you

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.080 
it's a kind of a softer plastic that you
can<00:01:40.409> move<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.770> down<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> middle

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
can move up and down and then the middle

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.490 
can move up and down and then the middle
body<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.899> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.229> hard<00:01:43.470> plastic

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
body part is kind of this hard plastic

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
body part is kind of this hard plastic
well<00:01:44.130> which<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.520> has<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:44.790> talons<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
well which also has these talons in the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
well which also has these talons in the
back<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.430> receive

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
back which you know can then receive

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.999 
back which you know can then receive
rods<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.659> Lego<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:49.799> kind<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
rods from Lego so you could kind of

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.560 
rods from Lego so you could kind of
stick<00:01:50.250> around<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.670> there<00:01:50.880> or<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> carry

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
stick around on there or make it carry

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
stick around on there or make it carry
something<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> interesting

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
pretty neat little feature I do like

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.800 
pretty neat little feature I do like

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
that it's on a ball-joint a mini Baldwin

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.479 
that it's on a ball-joint a mini Baldwin
so<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.019> can<00:04:17.140> get<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.290> little<00:04:17.470> bit<00:04:17.620> more<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:18.250> guess

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
so you can get a little bit more I guess

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.300 
so you can get a little bit more I guess
pose<00:04:18.790> ability<00:04:19.090> with<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.859> on<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:21.160> other

shooter and once you fold it you could
see<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.470> does<00:04:57.620> have<00:04:57.650> some<00:04:57.949> stickers<00:04:58.280> right

by using your imagination of course and
then<00:05:46.789> like<00:05:46.940> all<00:05:47.150> helicopters<00:05:47.719> it<00:05:47.810> has<00:05:47.930> these

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
then like all helicopters it has these

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.689 
then like all helicopters it has these

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
spinning rudders on the top right here

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.430 
spinning rudders on the top right here
which<00:05:50.630> worked<00:05:50.900> just<00:05:51.110> fine

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440

and also you do have this bottom part
which<00:05:54.139> has<00:05:54.320> that<00:05:54.469> sled<00:05:54.830> piece<00:05:55.159> or<00:05:55.430> sled<00:05:55.669> frame

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
which has that sled piece or sled frame

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.089 
which has that sled piece or sled frame
piece<00:05:56.360> as<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.630> call<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:56.960> which<00:05:57.560> is<00:05:57.590> a<00:05:57.740> little<00:05:57.919> bit

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
piece as I call it which is a little bit

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.680 
piece as I call it which is a little bit
more<00:05:58.280> in<00:05:58.400> common<00:05:58.610> with<00:05:58.759> sets<00:05:59.090> nowadays<00:05:59.539> so

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
more in common with sets nowadays so

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.730 
more in common with sets nowadays so
it's<00:05:59.810> nice<00:05:59.930> to<00:06:00.020> get<00:06:00.110> that<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:00.440> a<00:06:00.500> twenty

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 
fine and you do get some cool pieces

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.490 
fine and you do get some cool pieces
like<00:07:37.270> a<00:07:37.300> turbine<00:07:37.660> piece<00:07:37.960> and<00:07:38.229> this<00:07:38.320> little

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
like a turbine piece and this little

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.010 
like a turbine piece and this little
windshield<00:07:38.949> right<00:07:39.160> here<00:07:39.520> but<00:07:40.360> I<00:07:40.539> think<00:07:40.870> it

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020 
windshield right here but I think it

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.779 
windshield right here but I think it
would<00:07:41.169> have<00:07:41.289> been<00:07:41.380> cool<00:07:41.590> if<00:07:41.620> it<00:07:41.860> had<00:07:42.010> a<00:07:42.250> more<00:07:42.760> I

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789 
would have been cool if it had a more I

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:44.400 
would have been cool if it had a more I
guess<00:07:43.120> unique<00:07:43.510> play<00:07:43.720> feature<00:07:43.990> instead<00:07:44.289> of

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.410 
guess unique play feature instead of

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.930 
guess unique play feature instead of
just<00:07:44.530> shooting<00:07:44.770> the<00:07:44.950> nets<00:07:45.160> and<00:07:45.400> shooting<00:07:45.820> this

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:45.940 
just shooting the nets and shooting this

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.760 
just shooting the nets and shooting this
little<00:07:46.180> stud<00:07:46.360> shooter<00:07:46.660> but<00:07:47.410> it's<00:07:47.590> nice<00:07:47.740> that

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770 
little stud shooter but it's nice that

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.930 
little stud shooter but it's nice that
you<00:07:48.010> can't<00:07:48.250> make<00:07:48.400> it<00:07:48.490> a<00:07:48.550> little<00:07:48.639> bit<00:07:48.820> more

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:48.940 
you can't make it a little bit more

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.450 
you can't make it a little bit more
compact<00:07:49.389> by<00:07:49.690> pushing<00:07:50.050> these<00:07:50.260> things<00:07:50.530> in<00:07:50.740> but

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.460 
compact by pushing these things in but

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.700 
compact by pushing these things in but
other<00:07:51.639> than<00:07:51.729> that<00:07:51.820> I<00:07:52.180> do<00:07:52.300> rate<00:07:52.780> this<00:07:52.960> sets<00:07:53.289> a<00:07:53.470> B

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.710 
other than that I do rate this sets a B

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.010 
other than that I do rate this sets a B
I<00:07:53.919> think<00:07:54.220> I<00:07:54.340> love<00:07:54.669> the<00:07:54.850> Simon<00:07:55.330> minifigure<00:07:55.840> and

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.020 
I think I love the Simon minifigure and

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.930 
I think I love the Simon minifigure and
it's<00:07:56.440> I<00:07:56.530> ranted<00:07:56.740> on<00:07:56.889> but<00:07:57.460> I<00:07:57.490> don't<00:07:57.639> know<00:07:57.760> if<00:07:57.849> it

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940 
it's I ranted on but I don't know if it

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.700 
it's I ranted on but I don't know if it
totally<00:07:58.150> justifies<00:07:58.750> the<00:07:58.930> price<00:07:58.960> due<00:07:59.530> to<00:07:59.560> the

00:07:59.700 --> 00:07:59.710 
totally justifies the price due to the

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.379 
totally justifies the price due to the
lack<00:08:00.010> of<00:08:00.310> kind<00:08:00.520> of<00:08:00.610> an<00:08:00.729> interesting<00:08:00.940> build

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:01.389 
lack of kind of an interesting build

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.330 
lack of kind of an interesting build
with<00:08:01.990> that<00:08:02.229> little<00:08:02.380> helicopter<00:08:03.010> right<00:08:03.130> there

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.340 
with that little helicopter right there

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.580 
with that little helicopter right there
