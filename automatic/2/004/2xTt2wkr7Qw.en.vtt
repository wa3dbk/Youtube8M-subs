00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.569
 for the race as he has not shown in this 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.700
 west day us and for the entire race 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.820
 from garden city 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.500
 Naciri release a single from there for 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.929
 square win they had careers in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 the ranch they walk to it seems that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.960
 they came out one earned a loss and a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.640
 tie 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.789
 they say there's a lot of controversy in the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.470
 tie some say he won the block 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.009
 general another they say they talk about the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.509
 aldana ranchers we do not have the photo but 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.370
 do not lose us if someone can not 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:40.020
 put this 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 to see how the horses came out 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.879
 also this let's practice d 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 of the horses that walk better 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.449
 surrendering in our moments the other 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.019
 day I put a comment that my opinion 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.670
 was that the crow was the best horse 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:03.930
 from kansas and many people put their opinion 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 and this is very true people see alone 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 and the cantinera have a lot much much 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.730
 credit that is one of the best those 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.370
 two animals but 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.490
 we do not know yet who would be the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.680
 winner in about 250 200 yards I 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 I would like to see that career in my opinion 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.850
 I think the cantinera is better came to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.550
 that the horse 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.850
 this achievement back in garden very well says 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.060
 that it is not true that he did not win but hopefully 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.650
 we see one day you can play it seems like 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.720
 they are not in the same squad but 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.380
 they still do not play against but hopefully 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.770
 One day this can see 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.560
 in an open something these horses but 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.299
 right now in my opinion of many people 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.930
 we think that the body of Juan one level 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.880
 very high and very fast not only there for 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.700
 quadra bosses that screaming really good 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.070
 this also in other voices about the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.079
 failure and this many people do what 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.549
 call where you want and if certain 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.900
 many horses that can win the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.210
 failure 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.690
 yes, but in the southeast of 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.550
 kansas right now is happening 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.640
 very real if I do not think that right now I can 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.070
 that can win maybe this if 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.010
 runs comes lyon china in with china 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.600
 it could be that I won him this recently 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 it seems that it did not happen well we do not know 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.700
 because if there was an error we can see and then 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.550
 the failure of the other day he won 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.490
 very easy to the core has remembered the friend 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.620
 Faust and 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.220
 I do not know how they put me here 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.010
 I called May 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.950
 it's very easy to enroll kansas and it did not happen 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.610
 the piojito we go to the old people there 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:53.530
 by gardens and kansas and already all the people 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.240
 but in the other aspect, I think 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.680
 now the strong hair of this 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.960
 area would be the body and the failure in 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.640
 failure down and the crow up this 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.480
 there's not much competition and I think 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480
 cliques in this area 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.480
 a little more 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.170
 of rancho the aldana were racing 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.990
 the past 23 of December and in garden 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.200
 was to save all three to regenerate three 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.330
 for three rather this in the first in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.390
 the first race the speckled version 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.480
 the girl this seems to be the girl won 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.020
 very easy almost clarity not believing the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.460
 another horse in this nascent race 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.510
 the black wind seems to also 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.150
 won the terrorist well in 300 yards and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.700
 then in the last one was the comet and the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.650
 mexican these are of controversy 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.360
 of who won who and which one in 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.700
 truth we do not know tell us the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.980
 argues that the comet won not thermal 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.200
 what the Mexican won is not known no no 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.150
 I have seen the photo I wish there is one of 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.710
 Manage them a career they can not put 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.500
 to see them all this one 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.070
 it was a very tough race and I hope that it 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.210
 I can do again for that race 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.790
 we are here for everyone for the owner 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.980
 of the commit the speck the compadre 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.830
 I'm from peace 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.700
 from the general block to all the people of 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.460
 this 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.680
 to see what they think of that career and if 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.950
 like to see that race for that or what 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.950
 wave 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.180
 for all the people who do not know the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.150
 black wind is the black horse saldaña 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.439
 he does little lost against the body 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.860
 but we all know that the body when 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:51.800
 when very fast and it was and that wind 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.439
 black there is a hall and he won the wing and 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.569
 the block solís the shaved lion seems 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:01.009
 they call him it was a hard race 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:03.949
 but this black wind won well for the 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.610
 who do not know the comet is the comet is 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.680
 the horse that has played is here in 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.969
 these areas the game with the loops 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.610
 it seems that with the mere grouper and has also 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:19.819
 won other horses this the spot 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.400
 we do not know her as a finalist in the derby 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:26.120
 carrington has won the open has 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.039
 lost this came out second when this one 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.700
 the qualifications of the derby in garden 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.970
 against him alone he alone won 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.850
 is a good mare the horses of 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.530
 I do not know them very well 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.200
 mental habits in which the hill girl 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.810
 very strong seems recently opened here 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.030
 in garden in another two new ones I know 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.300
 very good but it seems that they are good 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.300
 as well 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.400
 and if you have an opinion on the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.530
 races this past Sunday can 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.360
 comment what was your opinion and what 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.390
 they think the races which they 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.720
 like to see this is also the one 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:07.290
 would make us see very soon if the horse and 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.170
 of the blocks I do not know how it will 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:14.610
 for then if it's square by how 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:17.010
 it is there and the friend simón walks 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.870
 the change that the mere mere and the 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.350
 skinny I do it as well known as skinny 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.930
 of sgae where being a sweep has not 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.750
 lost and win all and with 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.240
 squirts you want and it 's time for this 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.580
 that with an elbow and well this one seems that 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.650
 there is not every time you want to play and 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.320
 so he said very soon he won 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.590
 very easy to the block smurf of the 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.830
 panchitos and the garden and we left it 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.570
 half land has left the skinny of January 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.990
 from the other flank must also has won 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:52.710
 When you jump, jump all 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:56.780
 this place if they give us information to see 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.780
 when do you play that you would like to play 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.070
