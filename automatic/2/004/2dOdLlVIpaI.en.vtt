00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.830
 they fly they record and they take images they capture 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.690
 all kinds of information but they result 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.240
 relatively simple to pass 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.310
 unnoticed like that are the drones 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.800
 little robots that have arrived for 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.080
 stay there are many kinds of ways 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.660
 sizes and prices but in this video os 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 let's tell what the 5 drones are 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.820
 what else have caught our attention and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.820
 that will dominate the market in this 2015 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.949
 in the number 5 sima x 5 ce explorer 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.899
 due to its low price just 50 euros 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.399
 and its benefits is one of the 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.670
 better drones for those people 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.879
 who want to start in the piloting of 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.789
 these devices integrates a camera 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.280
 2 megapixels and its flight autonomy is 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.280
 8 to 10 minutes after which 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.799
 you will need 100 minutes to load your 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.860
 500 lithium polymer battery 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.280
 milliamperes being so light so alone 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.050
 weighs 290 grams you'll have to have a lot 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 Beware of possible gusts of 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.280
 outdoor wind 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.789
 at number 4 you will find sky nano 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.399
 drone one of the quadrocopters more 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.530
 small of the world measures 4 x 4 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.200
 centimeters has a system of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 6- axis flight control and owns 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.640
 adjustable gyroscope sensitivity 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.829
 It also comes with LED lights that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.319
 allow you to fly at night or in a 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.569
 This mini dark room dro no 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.390
 has a built-in camera so only 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.909
 it's good to see it fly but it 's so 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.009
 nice anyway is capable of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.159
 perform acrobatics in the air up 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:52.489
 8 different ways plus the best of 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.489
 all its price around 50 euros 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.050
 in the third drawer of the podium we place 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.020
 Lily a pretty expensive drone 999 dollars 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.390
 but that has a particularity of the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.550
 that no other can boast is a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.250
 drone that chases you and records without 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.380
 need for any kind of control what 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.870
 you take the spears and fly 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.550
 lilia resistant to water and its particular 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.070
 shape allows you to float 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.720
 being able to start its operations from 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.520
 the marine surface 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 Lily records videos in one quality 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.770
 equivalent to that of a go pro hero 3 and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.860
 the photos are 12 megapixels while 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.770
 that the battery lasts about 20 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.780
 minutes this drone stays from 15 to 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.209
 30 meters away from the controller 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.890
 circulate if at any time you lose the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.890
 connection lands alone 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.350
 it looks like a little insect but in 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.510
 actually it is a tiny robot 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.900
 that weighs three quarters of a gram 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.910
 and it's only 17 centimeters east 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.520
 small flying robot made of paper 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.710
 and polystyrene wafer is activated with 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.050
 a small source of heat to move around 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.070
 at a speed of 3 centimeters per 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.510
 second although it is also able to swim 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.970
 one of the most peculiarities 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.760
 highlights of this tiny robot is that 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.470
 can be dissolved autonomously like this 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.310
 how to fold over your own body 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.350
 to get to disappear completely 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.330
 at the moment it is in development but the 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.710
 team of researchers expected to be 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.990
 available for the end of the year 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.240
 and in the first box of the podium we 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.940
 we find with jumping sumo de parrot 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.520
 a robot without face or back without top 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.760
 or below does not matter as put 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.430
 jumping sumo running zigzag makes 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.370
 pirouettes and take the curves at 90 degrees 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.960
 jumping sumo uses only two wheels 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.290
 to perform some maneuvers 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.180
 really amazing and combining the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.660
 Traction of the jump mechanism 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.090
 possibilities are almost unlimited their 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.460
 Maximum speed is 7 km 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.770
 hour and the jumps may be 80 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.110
 centimeters both horizontally and in 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.490
 vertical jumping sumo can take 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.620
 catches at 640 by 480 pixels as well as 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.710
 Capture videos at 30 frames per second 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.150
 the battery life is somewhat scarce 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.699
 since they are 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.829
 only 20 minutes and its price 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.960
 around 150 euros 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.939
 and up to here our selection with the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.099
 most curious and striking drones 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.810
 market if you do not agree and you think 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.879
 that we have left some for the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.340
 way as we always invite you to 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:37.050
 leave us your recommendations below in 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.050
 the comments to fly
