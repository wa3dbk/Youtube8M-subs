to the end of the hair and what you'll

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.469 
to the end of the hair and what you'll
find<00:01:18.500> is<00:01:18.979> when<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.250> do<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.759> that<00:01:20.420> that

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
find is when you do that that that

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.440 
find is when you do that that that
starts<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.409> kind<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.679> twist<00:01:21.950> in<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:23.030> itself

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
starts to kind of twist in on itself

then we're going to work on big fat

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.929 
then we're going to work on big fat
sections<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> next<00:01:49.799> one's<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.399> from

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
sections the next one's going to be from

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
sections the next one's going to be from
the<00:01:51.000> recession<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.079> through<00:01:52.259> -<00:01:52.530> just

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the recession of going through - just

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.350 
the recession of going through - just
underneath<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> cramp<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.970> were<00:01:54.060> probably

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
underneath the cramp we were probably

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.090 
underneath the cramp we were probably
going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.689> split<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> top<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.890> about

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
going to split the top up into about

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
going to split the top up into about
four<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.030> five<00:01:57.179> six<00:01:57.569> sections<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.200> going

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
four or five six sections so I'm going

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.809 
four or five six sections so I'm going
to<00:01:58.409> cut<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.649> my<00:02:00.979> I've<00:02:01.979> twisted<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.520> Lena's

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
to cut all my I've twisted all Lena's

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.539 
to cut all my I've twisted all Lena's
hair<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.209> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.569> see<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:05.039> sections

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
hair up you can see that the sections

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.949 
hair up you can see that the sections
are<00:02:05.670> very<00:02:05.700> very<00:02:06.090> round<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.630> what<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:06.929> doing

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
are very very round and what I'm doing

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.380 
are very very round and what I'm doing
now<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.319> really<00:02:07.590> bake<00:02:07.950> these<00:02:08.640> curls<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.269> I'm

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
now to really bake these curls in I'm

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.720 
now to really bake these curls in I'm
just<00:02:09.599> using<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.929> straightening<00:02:10.380> irons

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
just using my straightening irons

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.759 
just using my straightening irons
interests<00:02:11.730> literally<00:02:12.380> going<00:02:13.380> over<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
interests literally going over the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.479 
interests literally going over the
twists<00:02:14.250> my<00:02:14.849> advice<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.330> always<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.810> overfeed

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
twists my advice is always to overfeed

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.120 
twists my advice is always to overfeed
rather<00:02:17.489> than<00:02:17.760> under<00:02:18.269> heat<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.780> let<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.799> cool

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
rather than under heat and let that cool

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.890 
rather than under heat and let that cool
down<00:02:20.269> now<00:02:21.269> take<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.840> curl<00:02:22.110> out<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.690> what<00:02:24.810> I'm

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
down now take that curl out so what I'm

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.050 
down now take that curl out so what I'm
doing<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.200> literally<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:26.130> separating<00:02:26.910> this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
doing is literally just separating this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.930 
doing is literally just separating this
one<00:02:27.450> twist<00:02:27.920> into<00:02:28.920> little<00:02:29.220> pieces<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.790> can

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
one twist into little pieces and you can

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.930 
one twist into little pieces and you can
see<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.420> curl<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.739> very<00:02:32.069> shining<00:02:32.579> it's<00:02:32.819> got

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
see this curl is very shining it's got

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.759 
see this curl is very shining it's got
loads<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.329> texture<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.959> loads<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.440> volume

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
loads of texture to it loads of volume

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.590 
loads of texture to it loads of volume
so<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.910> take<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.329> rest<00:02:36.480> of
