hello<00:00:00.690> everyone<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.230> professor<00:00:01.680> irony<00:00:02.100> and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hello everyone I'm professor irony and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello everyone I'm professor irony and
this<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.270> video<00:00:03.419> testing<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.080> YouTube<00:00:04.650> 60

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
this is video testing on YouTube 60

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.760 
this is video testing on YouTube 60
frames<00:00:05.490> per<00:00:05.819> second<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:07.379> seems<00:00:07.620> that

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
frames per second and it seems that

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.850 
frames per second and it seems that
YouTube<00:00:08.220> has<00:00:08.519> updated<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:10.170> channels<00:00:10.710> that

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
YouTube has updated the channels that

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.549 
YouTube has updated the channels that
can<00:00:11.040> use<00:00:11.219> 60fps<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.110> probably<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.259> rolling

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
can use 60fps and probably just rolling

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.560 
can use 60fps and probably just rolling
out<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> ability<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.190> everyone<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:15.000> use<00:00:15.030> 60

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
out the ability for everyone to use 60

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.279 
out the ability for everyone to use 60
frames<00:00:15.809> per<00:00:15.900> second<00:00:16.440> no<00:00:17.369> matter<00:00:17.580> who<00:00:17.910> they<00:00:18.119> are

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
frames per second no matter who they are

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.160 
frames per second no matter who they are
so<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> wanted<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> test<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.640> myself<00:00:21.170> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so I wanted to test it out myself the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.929 
so I wanted to test it out myself the
video<00:00:22.410> you're<00:00:22.560> watching<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.980> screen<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.640> half

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
project which is a a total conversion

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.729 
project which is a a total conversion
mod<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.529> sonic<00:00:32.250> generations<00:00:32.780> sonic<00:00:33.780> looks

mod for sonic generations sonic looks
beautiful<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.640> 60fps<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> why<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> chose

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
beautiful in 60fps which is why I chose

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.520 
beautiful in 60fps which is why I chose
it<00:00:38.540> I'm<00:00:39.540> also<00:00:39.750> doing<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.110> direct

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it I'm also doing this direct

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
it I'm also doing this direct
side-by-side<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> beginning<00:00:41.700> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
side-by-side here in the beginning so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
side-by-side here in the beginning so
that<00:00:42.540> people<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.200> see<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> difference

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that people can see the difference

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.529 
that people can see the difference
between<00:00:44.489> 60<00:00:45.390> FPS<00:00:45.780> video<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.260> 30fps<00:00:46.739> video

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
between 60 FPS video and 30fps video

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.670 
between 60 FPS video and 30fps video
because<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> lot<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> people<00:00:49.050> seem<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> say<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
because a lot of people seem to say that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
because a lot of people seem to say that
they<00:00:49.800> don't<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.190> don't<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> difference

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
they don't they don't see a difference

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.709 
they don't they don't see a difference
between<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:52.910> maybe<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.149> will<00:00:54.300> help<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
between them maybe this will help out a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
between them maybe this will help out a
bit<00:00:55.020> did<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> difference<00:00:56.730> now

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
bit did really see the difference now

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
bit did really see the difference now
that<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:58.260> weird

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that you don't have to go to some weird

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.420 
that you don't have to go to some weird
website<00:00:59.100> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.480> 60<00:01:01.230> FPS<00:01:01.350> comparison<00:01:02.219> we

website to get a 60 FPS comparison we
can<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> directly<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.390> YouTube<00:01:03.780> well

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
can have it directly on YouTube well

this is a direct YouTube of 30 to 60 FPS
comparison<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.700> towards<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> end<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.479> the

comparison here towards the end of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
comparison here towards the end of the
video<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.140> getting<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.920> framedrops<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
video I'm getting some framedrops on the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.020 
video I'm getting some framedrops on the
60fps<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:14.010> down<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> 55<00:01:14.760> it's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
60fps one it's going down to 55 it's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
60fps one it's going down to 55 it's
going<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.450> 40<00:01:15.930> eventually<00:01:16.409> goes<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> 38

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
going down 40 eventually goes down to 38

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
going down 40 eventually goes down to 38
I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.420> an<00:01:18.990> issue<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.530> my

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I think that's a that's an issue with my

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
I think that's a that's an issue with my
with<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.430> capture<00:01:21.000> software<00:01:21.350> combined<00:01:22.350> with

the<00:01:22.590> new<00:01:22.710> hard<00:01:22.950> drive<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.340> set<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.689> specifically

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the new hard drive I set up specifically

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.830 
the new hard drive I set up specifically
a<00:01:24.810> faster<00:01:25.350> hard<00:01:25.560> drive<00:01:26.330> 150<00:01:27.330> megabytes<00:01:27.659> right

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a faster hard drive 150 megabytes right

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.480 
a faster hard drive 150 megabytes right
speed<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:29.090> 60fps<00:01:30.090> video<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.430> don't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
speed for 60fps video in which I don't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
speed for 60fps video in which I don't
know<00:01:32.729> why<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.299> speed<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.869> went<00:01:34.140> down

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
know why the right speed just went down

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
know why the right speed just went down
in<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> middle<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> recording<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.729> couple<00:01:36.240> of

in the middle of recording a couple of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.120 
in the middle of recording a couple of
times<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.290> those<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.500> kinks<00:01:37.979> I'm

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
times but you know those are kinks I'm

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580 
times but you know those are kinks I'm
still<00:01:38.340> working<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.140> my<00:01:40.290> channel

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
still working out and I want my channel

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.520 
still working out and I want my channel
moving<00:01:40.979> forward<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.880> 60fps<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.350> as

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
moving forward to be in 60fps as much as

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
moving forward to be in 60fps as much as
possible<00:01:44.119> 60fps<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.420> essential<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> playing

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
possible 60fps is essential to playing

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
possible 60fps is essential to playing
video<00:01:46.770> games<00:01:47.040> sure<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.149> gives<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.630> double<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
video games sure it gives you double the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340 
video games sure it gives you double the
frames<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.610> react<00:01:50.990> essentially<00:01:51.990> playing<00:01:52.200> at

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
frames to react essentially playing at

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920 
frames to react essentially playing at
double<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.590> speed<00:01:52.939> but<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.360> watching<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
double the speed but I think watching it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
double the speed but I think watching it
is<00:01:55.049> also<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.500> experience<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.460> more

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
is also an experience that is more

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.020 
is also an experience that is more
enjoyable<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.979> 60fps<00:01:59.670> it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
enjoyable when it's at 60fps it's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.929 
enjoyable when it's at 60fps it's
smoother<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> looks<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.430> 60fps

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
smoother it looks it's so good at 60fps

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.469 
smoother it looks it's so good at 60fps
compared<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> 30<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> hope<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.210> can

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
compared to 30 then I I hope I can

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.119 
compared to 30 then I I hope I can
deliver<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> buy<00:02:07.560> capture

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
deliver that if I need to buy capture

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.070 
deliver that if I need to buy capture
card<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.209> something<00:02:09.390> too

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
card or something too

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.390 
card or something too
to<00:02:10.140> make<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.500> happen<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.950> will<00:02:12.410> but<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.830> think

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
to make that happen I will but I I think

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.790 
to make that happen I will but I I think
it's<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.790> important<00:02:15.300> for<00:02:15.660> readings<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.710> be

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
it's really important for readings to be

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.550 
it's really important for readings to be
captured<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.190> 60fps<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:18.120> forward<00:02:18.630> now<00:02:19.290> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
captured in 60fps going forward now that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.340 
captured in 60fps going forward now that
you<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:20.040> presumably<00:02:20.610> allows<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.840> for

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
you two presumably allows for that for

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.920 
you two presumably allows for that for
that<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.620> happen

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that to happen

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.080 
that to happen
no<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.170> gameplay<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.890> simply<00:02:26.670> the

no this gameplay here is simply the

hopefully<00:02:31.440> your<00:02:31.590> eyes<00:02:31.740> have<00:02:31.980> adjusted

hopefully your eyes have adjusted
already<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.150> tell<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> difference

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
already and you can tell the difference

already and you can tell the difference
this<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.940> big<00:02:36.270> deal<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.260> it

there's<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.390> couple<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.630> frame<00:02:45.840> drops<00:02:46.140> here<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
there's a couple of frame drops here and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.900 
there's a couple of frame drops here and
there<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.890> those<00:02:50.430> are<00:02:50.610> kinks

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
there as you can see but those are kinks

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.750 
there as you can see but those are kinks
that<00:02:50.940> need<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.360> worked<00:02:51.660> out<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.440> think<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.250> I'm

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that need to be worked out I think I I'm

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.250 
that need to be worked out I think I I'm
uploading<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.390> video<00:02:54.510> anyways<00:02:54.930> with<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
uploading this video anyways with the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.070 
uploading this video anyways with the
frame<00:02:55.500> drops<00:02:55.800> cuz<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.910> never<00:02:56.970> falls<00:02:57.480> below

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
frame drops cuz it never falls below

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.970 
frame drops cuz it never falls below
about<00:02:58.350> 40<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.160> 38<00:02:59.490> fps<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.590> still

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
about 40 to 38 fps so it's still

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.199 
about 40 to 38 fps so it's still
technically<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:03.180> video<00:03:03.930> that's<00:03:04.140> faster<00:03:04.980> than

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
technically a video that's faster than

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.150 
technically a video that's faster than
that's<00:03:06.209> that's<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.959> higher<00:03:07.140> quality<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:08.070> a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that's that's of a higher quality of a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.810 
that's that's of a higher quality of a
higher<00:03:08.580> FPS<00:03:09.230> than<00:03:10.230> anything<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:11.580> you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
higher FPS than anything that you

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.420 
higher FPS than anything that you
normally<00:03:12.390> see<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:14.489> YouTube<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:16.100> it's<00:03:17.100> still

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
normally see on on YouTube so it's still

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.650 
normally see on on YouTube so it's still
it's<00:03:18.150> still<00:03:18.269> better<00:03:18.630> can't<00:03:19.200> complain

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
it's still better can't complain

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.199 
it's still better can't complain
it<00:03:21.660> just<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.320> makes<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.739> even<00:03:22.890> more<00:03:23.250> great

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it just it just makes it even more great

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.150 
it just it just makes it even more great
the<00:03:24.360> difference<00:03:24.750> between<00:03:24.930> 30fps<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.769> 60fps
