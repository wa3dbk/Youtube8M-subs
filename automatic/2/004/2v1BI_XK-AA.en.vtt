00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the coffin all the guys who rests on and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660
 we are here with a new course video 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.730
 to be a hacker, it seems to me like the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 29 things to you today, I'll show you a 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.089
 like we could say a mixture between 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 what makes the video grow 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 the computer is the video files it does 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.619
 leaving the computer is what I have it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.699
 stop in there is a lot of command 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.050
 harmful very harmful than practically 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 we could say destroy ends 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.969
 possible ex file limits and delete 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.410
 including computer operating systems so 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.440
 much more difficult to recover 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.930
 many times it is too late and therefore 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 very harmful and meanwhile I wanted to do one 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.660
 premise is the ace I'll show this 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.969
 command but they do n't take it and play 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 marry and of no responsibility for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.789
 your actions for this video field 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.000
 informational purpose 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.730
 so whatever you have been doing for years 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 people like that are your stuff 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 it does not deserve to say however it can already school 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 where of the video is his fault your fault 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.049
 and must that goes well so if you accept 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.790
 these premises we can 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.790
 start well we begin 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.590
 ok this is the command 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.910
 practically this command what 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.030
 eliminates bootstrap type that would be later 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.880
 who did not know it would be kind is not a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 program because I have to say I do n't know how 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.790
 explain it easily as we could 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 say a program that is inside the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.880
 computer you want to take a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 application that you find on the desktop for 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.400
 understand it as a fantasy like skype no 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.890
 padua sand computer centers 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.720
 alone to boot the whole computer 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 sure to start tt all the systems 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.729
 computer or interface type 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.860
 graphics to file folders 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.170
 if it was the one, don't do anything 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.900
 so if limina bootstrap is just del 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.780
 a little bit month later maybe open up 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.500
 quarters of pure sausage stuff there is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.750
 own computer 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.180
 there is the roll but does nothing turn 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.110
 over and so on 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.450
 well 32 minutes this video here guys 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.700

 the graphics of the channel that made a 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.609
 the purpose channel for graphics and 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:23.530

 kind of blog without webcam then 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.900
 future projects I will make other videos 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:43.419
 especially if you're interested in html where 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.730
 I will explain a little to you which tml that 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.370
 would be the katia mind would be a 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.659
 language for doing city â€‹â€‹ie a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.449
 language for making websites if 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.459
 you every site you see made of 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:57.040
 html which are a series of commands for 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.810
 do certain things like I do n't know type 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.519
 rests on the web 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.949
 no here my page could be called 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.349
 what square everything already on the web you have to do it 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.389
 I have to capitalize a mail command 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.000
 to make it yellow colored to put 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.319
 however, the time set is not the background 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.419
 then maybe put them pictures of 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.799
 put videos on the site for maybe 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.389
 put that thing that makes you record 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.280
 name that thing that makes you donate 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.109
 money so one maybe video in the money 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.579
 I do n't know those things there and nothing is all there 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.370

 you can also see to learn more about 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:38.500
 more on visual basic and visual basic 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.820
 visual studio would be the program of 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.490
 hubble its bisol beautiful but then when 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.349

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.479
 of tutorials if you want to support shock like 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.280

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.500
 as we say with xv sometimes minecraft 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.200
 with the stuff there or otherwise the register with 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.780

 vegas pro12 of the crime as well then the 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.950
 future of the future I would like to register 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.920
 even with a program that is inside the 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.400
 my graphics card nvidia geforce gtx 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.690
 170 which practically shadow play e 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.470
 records in very precious avi format 20 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.680

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.160
 I wanted to make you want updates too 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.020

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.360
 yes I wanted to thank you very much look 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.260
 fat boys I never would 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.730
 waited to reach this goal 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.990
 515 and written passages if I don't remember 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.790
 thank you very much 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.470
 I'm really concerned about her ever 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.840
 waited for what to achieve 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.520
 thanks to all the guys really too 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.160
 displays per day go up to 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.940
 less than 300 400 impressions are 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.800
 I would be really happy from a channel 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.810
 channel and powerful 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.900
 oh well after this absurd crap that I have 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.370
 said we can finish that video and me 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.020
 sorry if maybe you hang out with this one 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.520
 these last three four minutes of 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.460
 explanations to the update channel 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.050
 all these things if these things what 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.120
 you want in the videos of the day of video 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.610
 if you don't tell me in a comment maybe if 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.860
 you want a blog if you even have one 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.370
 webcam as well as other channels we do 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.370
 of blogs 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.260
 ok then all the various links are 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.150
 description and also the command promises 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.680
 discretion as always so maybe not 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.260
 you have to watch a couple of videos 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.420
 to see the command you may not have 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.240
 a good line because to put quality 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.590
 minor because if it doesn't go it stops 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.100
 so you can't wait for them 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.030
 let's place the video can end 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.030
 square boys
