look<00:03:34.230> at<00:03:34.319> those<00:03:34.470> dangles<00:03:35.280> manhole<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:35.879> should

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
look at those dangles manhole you should

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.530 
look at those dangles manhole you should
then<00:03:36.239> BAM<00:03:37.220> Shea<00:03:38.220> Weber<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.579> think<00:03:38.849> pretty<00:03:39.090> mad

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
then BAM Shea Weber I think pretty mad

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.080 
then BAM Shea Weber I think pretty mad
yet<00:03:39.989> Shea<00:03:40.290> Weber<00:03:40.410> yeah<00:03:40.739> there<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.160> go<00:03:41.190> look<00:03:42.000> at

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
yet Shea Weber yeah there we go look at

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.699 
yet Shea Weber yeah there we go look at
that<00:03:42.180> net<00:03:42.480> look<00:03:42.720> at<00:03:42.810> those<00:03:42.930> graphics<00:03:43.440> just<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
that net look at those graphics just the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.770 
that net look at those graphics just the
nets<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> crowd<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.790> right<00:03:45.480> here<00:03:45.660> gonna

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
nets in the crowd and right here gonna

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.780 
nets in the crowd and right here gonna
pause<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.169> right<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:46.560> right<00:03:47.220> here<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.549> what

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
pause it right here right here is what

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.939 
pause it right here right here is what
EA<00:03:47.970> Sports<00:03:48.359> were<00:03:48.510> talking<00:03:48.840> about<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.440> 12<00:03:49.739> men

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
EA Sports were talking about the 12 men

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.479 
EA Sports were talking about the 12 men
physics<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:52.079> says<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.680> don't<00:03:52.889> like<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.340> not

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
physics it says I don't like it's not

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.670 
physics it says I don't like it's not
something<00:03:53.879> major<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.989> can<00:03:55.109> see<00:03:55.319> that<00:03:55.530> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
something major but you can see that the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.890 
something major but you can see that the
puck<00:03:55.889> is<00:03:56.370> actually<00:03:56.879> going<00:03:57.060> over<00:03:57.480> Brent

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
puck is actually going over Brent

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.129 
puck is actually going over Brent
Seabrook<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.220> he<00:03:59.340> doesn't<00:03:59.549> touch<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.090> puck<00:04:00.269> so

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
Seabrook so he doesn't touch the puck so

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.470 
Seabrook so he doesn't touch the puck so
I<00:04:01.500> don't<00:04:01.889> know<00:04:01.949> if<00:04:02.069> it's<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.060> would<00:04:03.209> count

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
I don't know if it's if you would count

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.270 
I don't know if it's if you would count
this<00:04:03.629> as<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> penalty<00:04:04.230> because<00:04:04.470> he<00:04:04.709> jumped<00:04:04.919> over

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
this as a penalty because he jumped over

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.369 
this as a penalty because he jumped over
and<00:04:05.609> iron<00:04:06.480> if<00:04:06.629> you<00:04:06.720> call<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:07.019> call<00:04:07.230> this

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
and iron if you call we call this

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.280 
and iron if you call we call this
tripping<00:04:07.859> but<00:04:08.699> hope<00:04:08.849> people<00:04:09.540> don't<00:04:09.659> spam<00:04:10.049> this

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
tripping but hope people don't spam this

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.050 
tripping but hope people don't spam this
all<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> time<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:11.040> actually<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:11.519> make<00:04:11.909> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
all the time and actually like make the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.610 
all the time and actually like make the
player<00:04:12.269> trip<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.019> actually<00:04:13.169> would

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
player trip and if you actually would

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.349 
player trip and if you actually would
trip<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:14.040> player<00:04:14.280> then<00:04:14.819> it'd<00:04:14.909> be<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> penalty

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
trip the player then it'd be a penalty

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.909 
trip the player then it'd be a penalty
but<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.169> touch<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.590> puck<00:04:16.709> first

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
but if you touch the puck first

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.210 
but if you touch the puck first
obviously<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:18.479> wouldn't<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> penalty<00:04:19.220> so

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
obviously it wouldn't be a penalty so

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.560 
obviously it wouldn't be a penalty so
there's<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:20.729> little<00:04:20.970> something<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.389> point

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
there's just a little something to point

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.709 
there's just a little something to point
out<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.870> just<00:04:22.019> hope<00:04:22.229> people<00:04:22.289> don't<00:04:22.889> abuse<00:04:23.460> this

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
out I just hope people don't abuse this

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.620 
out I just hope people don't abuse this
so<00:04:24.719> let's<00:04:25.050> continue<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:25.620> video<00:04:25.830> yes

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
so let's continue the video yes

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.000 
so let's continue the video yes
there<00:04:26.750> we<00:04:26.810> go<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.050> Toulmin<00:04:27.440> physics<00:04:27.830> actually

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
there we go the Toulmin physics actually

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.190 
there we go the Toulmin physics actually
real<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.090> if<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.300> know<00:04:29.420> you<00:04:29.480> would<00:04:29.660> try<00:04:30.020> and

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
real so if you know you would try and

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.990 
real so if you know you would try and
trip<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.740> actually<00:04:30.890> fall<00:04:31.280> on<00:04:31.460> him<00:04:31.610> if<00:04:31.850> you

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
trip you you actually fall on him if you

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.810 
trip you you actually fall on him if you
tripped<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.110> see<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.740> see<00:04:34.100> more<00:04:34.340> physics

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
tripped so you see I see more physics

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.180 
tripped so you see I see more physics
there<00:04:35.690> we<00:04:35.840> go<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.080> can<00:04:36.200> see<00:04:36.380> BAM<00:04:36.740> more

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
there we go you can see BAM more

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.070 
there we go you can see BAM more
realistic<00:04:37.940> look<00:04:37.970> at<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:38.420> crowd<00:04:38.660> actually<00:04:38.870> in

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
graphics just that like the shadow and

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.100 
graphics just that like the shadow and
everyone<00:05:04.670> okay<00:05:04.970> right<00:05:05.270> here<00:05:05.450> way<00:05:05.660> right<00:05:06.080> here

everyone okay right here way right here

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.310 
everyone okay right here way right here
you<00:05:07.040> see<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.400> they're<00:05:07.610> fighting<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.320> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
you see that they're fighting and the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.600 
you see that they're fighting and the
players<00:05:09.530> aren't<00:05:09.710> there<00:05:10.250> just<00:05:10.430> standing

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
players aren't there just standing

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.880 
players aren't there just standing
around<00:05:10.850> maybe<00:05:11.300> sometimes<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.290> happens<00:05:12.470> when

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
around maybe sometimes it happens when

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.990 
around maybe sometimes it happens when
they're<00:05:13.010> staying<00:05:13.250> around<00:05:13.430> but<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.910> doesn't

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
they're staying around but it doesn't

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.350 
they're staying around but it doesn't
look<00:05:14.210> like<00:05:14.270> NHL<00:05:14.870> 14<00:05:15.370> when<00:05:16.370> like<00:05:16.820> they're<00:05:17.180> just

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
look like NHL 14 when like they're just

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.430 
look like NHL 14 when like they're just
standing<00:05:17.540> around<00:05:17.690> like<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.110> want<00:05:18.290> to<00:05:18.320> see

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
standing around like I want to see
