so as you can see we have a few

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.200 
so as you can see we have a few
tournaments<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.170> can<00:00:07.319> select<00:00:07.500> from<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
tournaments so you can select from and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.730 
tournaments so you can select from and
the<00:00:09.210> major<00:00:09.389> ones<00:00:09.690> eight<00:00:09.929> twelve<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.500> sixteen

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
teams and they get really complex as

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.470 
teams and they get really complex as
well<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> 12<00:00:15.240> team

you're<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.260> see<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.699> get

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you're going to see that you can get

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
you're going to see that you can get
quite<00:00:24.150> complex<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> beauty<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
quite complex now the beauty of the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
quite complex now the beauty of the
system<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.960> logic<00:00:28.439> for

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
system is that all the logic for

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.279 
system is that all the logic for
determining<00:00:29.449> who<00:00:30.449> goes<00:00:30.660> where<00:00:30.869> after<00:00:31.199> they

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
determining who goes where after they

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
determining who goes where after they
win<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.560> lose<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.160> taken<00:00:32.460> care<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.910> you

before we get started is this kind of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.850 
before we get started is this kind of
area<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.899> drag<00:00:55.170> team<00:00:55.410> obviously

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
area right here the drag team obviously

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
area right here the drag team obviously
is<00:00:55.920> where<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.250> would<00:00:56.489> drag<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> team<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.510> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
here and here and here

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660

those<00:01:06.150> come<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.750> play<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.189> actually

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
those come into play when we actually

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
those come into play when we actually

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
of game eight so those will

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910 
of game eight so those will
automatically<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.869> populated<00:01:19.049> once<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.740> put

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
automatically be populated once we put

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.340 
automatically be populated once we put
the<00:01:20.009> scores<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.840> put<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> score<00:01:22.200> and

the scores in and to put a score and
it's<00:01:22.500> pretty<00:01:22.710> simple<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it's pretty simple all you got to do is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's pretty simple all you got to do is
put<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.960> cursor<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.680> zero<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
put your cursor on the zero there and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
put your cursor on the zero there and
you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> type<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> score<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> system

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you can type a score in and the system

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
you can type a score in and the system
smart<00:01:30.299> enough<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.799> whether<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
smart enough to know whether it's a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
smart enough to know whether it's a
whether<00:01:33.060> who's<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> winner<00:01:33.659> who's<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> loser

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
whether who's the winner who's the loser

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.590 
whether who's the winner who's the loser
or<00:01:34.740> even<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> tie<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.570> no

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
or even if it's a tie right and then no

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
or even if it's a tie right and then no
one<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:36.900> show<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.640> let's<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.909> go

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
one will show up here so let's just go

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.340 
one will show up here so let's just go
through<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.540> drag<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> couple<00:01:40.110> more

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
through and just drag a couple more

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.630 
through and just drag a couple more
teams<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.829> here

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760 

and<00:01:49.730> once<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.720> have<00:01:50.870> all<00:01:50.900> my<00:01:51.170> teams<00:01:51.440> I'm<00:01:51.620> just

and once I have all my teams I'm just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:02.360 
and once I have all my teams I'm just
going<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.950> go<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.460> fill<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.760> some<00:01:52.790> scores

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.750 

and<00:02:02.870> there<00:02:03.870> we<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.160> can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.580> that

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
and there we go so now you can see that

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.880 
and there we go so now you can see that
loser<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> Game<00:02:06.930> seven<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.470> game<00:02:07.590> eight<00:02:07.740> is
