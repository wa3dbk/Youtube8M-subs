and<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> almost<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.120> lock<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> our<00:00:36.540> prize<00:00:36.780> box

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and I almost a lock of our prize box

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.709 
and I almost a lock of our prize box
there<00:00:37.489> but<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> need<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.420> just

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
there but what you need to do is just

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.720 
there but what you need to do is just
make<00:00:39.930> sure<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.800> before<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.219> die<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> tag

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
make sure right before you die you tag

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
make sure right before you die you tag
them<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> blows<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.600> before<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
them because if it blows up before you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
them because if it blows up before you
die<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> ribbons<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.610> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
die you don't get the ribbons and it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
die you don't get the ribbons and it's
like<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> waste<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> time<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.559> see

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
like a waste of time so as you can see

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
like a waste of time so as you can see
there<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> ribbons<00:00:47.969> from<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
there I got a lot of ribbons from that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.910 
there I got a lot of ribbons from that
it's<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.570> far<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> quickest<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.770> them

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it's by far the quickest way to get them

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
it's by far the quickest way to get them
and<00:00:50.039> gives<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.309> judgment<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> find<00:00:51.300> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and gives more judgment that I find so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.200 
and gives more judgment that I find so
