00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.870
 I will use labor calibrated until 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 8 millimeters and so one meter 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.220
 freeze the solution so that here 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:47.400
 there was a mound only here we will leave 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:51.670
 centimeter take a twig 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:01:09.490
 12 millimeters we smear vertical 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 the seams immediately on four bricks we remove the pond 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.810
 and arrange the brick 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.509
 watch out with the bones here look here 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.390
 to 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.899
 before this brick coincided with the edges 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899
 lower 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.070
 nick chase here under the level 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.420
 We will love was a straight line 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 paving two rows take a plumb and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.060
 check for plumb 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:33.630
 edges 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.630
 stoves should converge in response with the cord
