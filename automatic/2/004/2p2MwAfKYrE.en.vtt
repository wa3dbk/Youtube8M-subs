00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
might ask because that happened earlier

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.010 
might ask because that happened earlier
when<00:02:28.110> when<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> had<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> pupil<00:02:29.490> or<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:30.330> singer<00:02:30.780> and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
when when I had a pupil or a singer and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.979 
when when I had a pupil or a singer and

that was asking me questions that's not
really<00:02:36.989> within<00:02:37.170> my<00:02:37.440> style<00:02:37.800> singing<00:02:38.190> then<00:02:38.670> I

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
really within my style singing then I

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.970 
really within my style singing then I
would<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.120> maybe<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.690> little<00:02:39.720> bit<00:02:39.989> afraid<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.349> say

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
would be maybe a little bit afraid I say

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.370 
would be maybe a little bit afraid I say
I<00:02:41.010> can't<00:02:41.580> answer<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.630> now<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.140> more

I can't answer that but now I have more
answers<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.520> broader<00:02:44.790> spectrum<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
answers in a broader spectrum the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.010 
answers in a broader spectrum the
Kachina<00:02:47.250> settling<00:02:47.640> has<00:02:48.210> been<00:02:48.420> studying<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
Kachina settling has been studying the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.020 
Kachina settling has been studying the
the<00:02:50.240> what<00:02:51.240> happens

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the what happens

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.850 
the what happens
in<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.330> food<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.780> what<00:02:52.930> happens<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.710> it's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
in the food and what happens is so it's

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.730 
in the food and what happens is so it's
it's<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.520> scientific<00:02:55.180> than<00:02:55.800> maybe<00:02:57.720> older

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
it's more scientific than maybe older

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's more scientific than maybe older
ways<00:02:59.740> of<00:03:00.100> explaining<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.930> use<00:03:01.960> of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.320> voice

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
ways of explaining the use of the voice

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.580 
ways of explaining the use of the voice
and<00:03:02.740> we<00:03:02.860> have<00:03:03.040> no<00:03:04.080> concept<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.290> one<00:03:07.590> particular

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and we have no concept of one particular

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.420 
and we have no concept of one particular
sound<00:03:09.250> being<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.790> right<00:03:10.030> one<00:03:10.080> it's<00:03:11.080> more<00:03:11.230> like

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
sound being the right one it's more like

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.490 
sound being the right one it's more like
trying<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.550> map<00:03:12.880> all<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.960> sounds<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
trying to map all the sounds that a

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.610 
trying to map all the sounds that a
voice<00:03:14.740> can<00:03:15.010> make<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.330> freer<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:17.230> it's

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
voice can make so it's freer it's it's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.090 
voice can make so it's freer it's it's
more<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.870> terms<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.260> singer<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.830> not

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
more on the terms of the singer and not

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.400 
more on the terms of the singer and not
so<00:03:21.250> much<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.700> teacher<00:03:22.170> that's<00:03:23.170> what<00:03:23.380> I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
so much of the teacher that's what I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.949 
so much of the teacher that's what I
think<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.920> most<00:03:24.100> important<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:25.450> helps<00:03:25.690> to

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
think is the most important it helps to

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.840 
think is the most important it helps to
know<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.290> you're<00:03:26.410> not<00:03:26.560> passing<00:03:27.190> something

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
know that you're not passing something

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.350 
know that you're not passing something
on<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.770> believe<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.550> true<00:03:30.760> it's

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
on that you just believe is true it's

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.930 
on that you just believe is true it's
it's<00:03:31.780> good<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.290> know<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.740> somebody<00:03:33.400> really

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
it's good to know that somebody really

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.280 
it's good to know that somebody really
looked<00:03:34.270> into<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:36.360> because<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.630> think<00:03:37.870> that's

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
looked into it because I think that's

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.520 
looked into it because I think that's
you<00:03:39.190> have<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.550> respect<00:03:39.970> singers<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:41.320> have

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
you have to respect singers and you have

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.890 
you have to respect singers and you have
