00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 for all this trick is dedicated to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 theme of the washing machine and how to extract the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.070
 same how to get it out when we have it 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.740
 placed in a large space like 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.750
 would be this with two side walls in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.990
 the one the only way to get the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.840
 washing machine would be asia is to plant and not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.060
 we have options to damage it to be able to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 stretch out of it because nothing is going to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.480
 see how we would do it simply to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.400
 come out easily 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.480
 the problem that the machine does not come out 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.000
 is that the legs of it are rubber 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.860
 said legs with the use and 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.559
 vibrations of the washing machine little by little 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.589
 they stick to the ground making a 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.269
 kind of windy effect because in the 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.589
 moment to try to stretch in the 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.890
 machine we have no option to move 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.870
 it costs us a lot of difficulty 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.460
 well nothing a simple method to be able 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.370
 perform the movement of the washing machine 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.630
 would be 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.570
 drastically because nothing we take a glass 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.980
 of water without making a glass by the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.930
 lower part and would move the 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.020
 doctor so that that water 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 will be placed on the bottom of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 the legs but I already say is a method that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.070
 it would take us all the water floor 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.860
 we can do it more easily and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
 which is equally effective wetting me a lot 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.530
 least for this we need a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 the syringe of 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.420
 typical of use in pharmacy the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.760
 greatest horse that you can 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 find what you have to buy the post 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.420
 since for example in medicines 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 which comes with syringe is a size 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.299
 much smaller then nothing 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.560
 we take a syringe we will also use 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:56.170
 a straw used in the soft drinks 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.710
 drinks typical of bars 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.080
 we can the cane 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.180
 We hold the toe cap with a bit of 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.850
 insulating tape for the first two 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.420
 legs would not need this trick but 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.090
 for the lower legs yes that can 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.470
 be recommendable we throw some water 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.010
 on the two front legs 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.380
 add a little more water 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.030
 introduce we aim approximately at 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.030
 where would the hind leg be 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.240
 and the same with the other one does not have to be said 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.480
 that if we remove the straw 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.080
 the syringe will be filled much more 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.080
 effectively 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.180
 we have to throw again 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:58.629
 and now it's just moving slightly 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:01.590
 life so that it says water and 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.410
 already approximately without difficulty 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.040
 we can take out the machine 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.020
 being much easier than not 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.120
 we would have thrown into the water because nothing 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.330
 I hope this little trick signs you 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.100
 of helping so much when it comes to getting the 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.320
 machine how to put it back for 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.730
 replace the machine rather than 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.560
 throw something with a glass so what 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 we would do it would be to pass the mop 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.620
 we would mop the floor 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.560
 wet to it from the back 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.459
 where I would place the machine and the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.459
 time to have to push 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.209
 the machine would enter with much more 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.370
 ease we would not pass any kind of 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.040
 effort to have to place the same 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.290
 Waiting bag retains the utility 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.969
 the little trick a greeting and that you follow 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.269
 visiting the videos can for you 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.269
 same
