 background and group coaches 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.940
 speed coaches we hit the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.650
 task first that all of our 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.989
 students could pass the credits 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.060
 needed to participate in the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.400
 just as this has been 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.480
 by tradition a difficulty that has 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.099
 they have to have an average 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.470

 prepared numbers we understood that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.410
 we could have approximately 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.250
 150 points and in the end we could get it 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.810
 with the sacrifice of each of the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.970

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.280
 Well, this was my second year and I can 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.040
 to say that I do not enjoy this year as 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.020
 the first year I do not enjoy myself not no what 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.660
 I enjoyed this year so much this year 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.820
 I enjoyed it to the fullest every jump for 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.230
 I was a smile I was still very 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.630
 my coach's instructions well 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.580
 confident because I had worked for 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.010
 achieve my goal so I was 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.770
 well committed to a smile did my 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.990
 work and we celebrated if the track is 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.840
 New track 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.090
 and what do you think the track can not 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.810
 track too stick throws half of 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.490
 helps too much help if because 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.860
 now the javelin rail was more 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.540
 comfortable to launch since the year 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.630
 for last year I was a little 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.460
 how hard and well now it was more or 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.530
 less to the mold of each athlete 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.630
 since many managed to improve 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.960
 personal brands as brands lai 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.990
 also and then one had very excellent 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.940
 flower pencil and experience in general 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.380
 the truth because I felt very well 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.260
 although the first day that was the 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.900
 semifinal it rained a lot and so we saw that 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.060
 throw and well I did not feel good with 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.590
 launch that but I had faith that the 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.720
 next day I was going to improve my 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.580
 mark and then it happened and the truth 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.860
 it seems something very wonderful this is 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.259
 and they trust in day I will continue like this for 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.900
 keep giving the best for me and me 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.920
 and for my university, power was for 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.300
 all of us 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.800
 this year we had a very young group 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:42.030
 we had replaced many of the 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.080
 athletes who had participated in the year 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.240
 previous 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.800
 but we understood that they were 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.810
 young athletes I understand that this is 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.110
 one of the best teams that I have 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.120
 had in the law because they are an athlete 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.880
 which are new promotion but have 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.830
 a lot of breeding has a lot of breeding and we hope 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.720
 continue to improve the results and
