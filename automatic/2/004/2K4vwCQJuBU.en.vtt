in<00:00:00.210> today's<00:00:00.599> program<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.949> look

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
in today's program we're going to look

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.619 
in today's program we're going to look
at<00:00:02.280> systems<00:00:02.639> that<00:00:02.909> are<00:00:03.060> mounted<00:00:03.149> permanently

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
at systems that are mounted permanently

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.379 
at systems that are mounted permanently
on<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.620> roof<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.549> motorhome<00:00:08.210> again<00:00:09.210> there

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
on the roof of the motorhome again there

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.620 
on the roof of the motorhome again there
are<00:00:09.480> many<00:00:09.740> different<00:00:10.740> types<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.880> fixed

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
are many different types of fixed

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.110 
are many different types of fixed
satellite<00:00:13.259> dish<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> most<00:00:14.280> basic

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
satellite dish this is the most basic

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.550 
satellite dish this is the most basic
and<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> cheapest<00:00:15.809> around<00:00:16.020> four<00:00:16.260> or<00:00:16.350> five

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and the cheapest around four or five

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
and the cheapest around four or five
hundred<00:00:16.920> pounds<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:18.449> operated<00:00:18.930> from

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
hundred pounds or so it's operated from

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.830 
hundred pounds or so it's operated from
inside<00:00:19.609> it's<00:00:20.609> called<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.850> crank<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:23.840> once

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
inside it's called a crank up and once

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
inside it's called a crank up and once
you've<00:00:25.080> achieved<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.189> elevation<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
you've achieved the elevation use a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.540 
you've achieved the elevation use a
little<00:00:27.210> handle<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.410> turn<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.859> using

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
little handle you have to turn it using

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.510 
little handle you have to turn it using
the<00:00:29.670> big<00:00:29.910> norm<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.769> course<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> those

to<00:00:51.989> control<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.010> system<00:00:53.219> put<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> dish<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.059> we

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to control the system put the dish up we

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.029 
to control the system put the dish up we
switch<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> system<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:58.550> and<00:01:00.079> in<00:01:01.079> fact<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
switch the system on and in fact the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
switch the system on and in fact the
last<00:01:02.219> satellite<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.120> selected<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.870> after

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
last satellite that I selected was after

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
last satellite that I selected was after
28<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.990> dish<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.650> up

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.490 

you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.260 

so<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:21.680> we<00:01:21.770> are<00:01:21.799> up<00:01:22.159> on<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.640> roof<00:01:22.820> with<00:01:23.090> my

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
so here we are up on the roof with my

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.359 
so here we are up on the roof with my
folding<00:01:24.049> satellite<00:01:24.619> dish<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.130> just

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
folding satellite dish that I just

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.609 
folding satellite dish that I just
controlled<00:01:26.150> from<00:01:26.360> down<00:01:26.600> inside<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
controlled from down inside the

now<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.090> kind<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.450> dish<00:01:29.630> often<00:01:29.869> has<00:01:30.400> dish<00:01:31.400> the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
now this kind of dish often has dish the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.830 
now this kind of dish often has dish the
size<00:01:32.390> between<00:01:32.869> 60<00:01:33.440> 80<00:01:33.920> 85<00:01:34.759> centimeters<00:01:35.299> in

and<00:01:39.610> it's<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:41.060> good<00:01:41.360> if<00:01:41.479> you're<00:01:41.600> going

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
and it's really good if you're going

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.649 
and it's really good if you're going
down<00:01:42.049> into<00:01:42.770> Europe<00:01:43.310> now<00:01:44.210> then<00:01:44.360> there's<00:01:44.570> a

down into Europe now then there's a

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.240 
down into Europe now then there's a
slight<00:01:44.899> problem<00:01:45.440> here<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.649> I<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:45.950> talk

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
later in 2013 or maybe early 2014 we

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860 
later in 2013 or maybe early 2014 we
just<00:02:25.220> don't<00:02:25.430> know<00:02:25.670> exactly<00:02:26.299> what's<00:02:26.600> going<00:02:26.780> to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
just don't know exactly what's going to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.350 
just don't know exactly what's going to
happen<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.410> frankly<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.579> bigger<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> dish

happen and frankly the bigger the dish

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600 
happen and frankly the bigger the dish
the<00:02:29.959> better<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.530> chances<00:02:31.040> you're<00:02:31.190> gonna<00:02:31.280> have

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the better the chances you're gonna have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.349 
the better the chances you're gonna have

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
Europe this sort of dish has a big

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.789 
Europe this sort of dish has a big
disadvantage<00:02:38.239> though<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.989> can't<00:02:39.260> watch

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
disadvantage though you can't watch

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.880 
disadvantage though you can't watch
television<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:41.000> can't<00:02:41.239> use<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.959> system<00:02:42.440> if

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
television you can't use the system if

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.420 
television you can't use the system if
there's<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.220> high<00:02:43.760> wind<00:02:44.560> they<00:02:45.560> will<00:02:45.920> be<00:02:46.160> caught

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
there's a high wind they will be caught

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.270 
there's a high wind they will be caught
and<00:02:46.700> they<00:02:47.090> will<00:02:47.359> blow<00:02:48.019> over<00:02:48.049> no<00:02:48.890> permanent

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and they will blow over no permanent

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.890 
and they will blow over no permanent
damage<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.209> won't<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.510> able<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.750> watch

television and that's where sack domes
like<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.470> come<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.609> it<00:02:56.540> doesn't<00:02:56.780> matter<00:02:56.930> what

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
like this come in it doesn't matter what

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.410 
like this come in it doesn't matter what
the<00:02:57.500> weather<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.829> like<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.700> watch<00:02:58.850> TV

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the weather is like you can watch TV

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.280 
the weather is like you can watch TV
with<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> dome<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.829> no<00:03:01.760> problem<00:03:02.290> it's

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
with a dome like this no problem it's

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.030 
with a dome like this no problem it's
not<00:03:03.440> affected<00:03:03.950> by<00:03:04.130> wind<00:03:04.480> nor<00:03:05.480> rain<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:06.859> course

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
not affected by wind nor rain of course

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.130 
not affected by wind nor rain of course
the<00:03:07.250> dish<00:03:07.400> inside<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.970> smaller<00:03:08.390> than<00:03:08.930> these

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the dish inside is smaller than these

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.349 
the dish inside is smaller than these
dishes<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.799> that's<00:03:10.280> going<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.519> limit<00:03:10.820> the

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
dishes and that's going to limit the

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.590 
dishes and that's going to limit the
range<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:12.290> new<00:03:12.500> Astra<00:03:13.040> satellites<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:14.269> got

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
range the new Astra satellites have got

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.500 
range the new Astra satellites have got
a<00:03:14.630> tighter<00:03:15.140> beam<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.430> footprint<00:03:17.120> that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
a tighter beam and the footprint that

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.330 
a tighter beam and the footprint that
means<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.870> area<00:03:18.319> in<00:03:18.739> which<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.190> receive

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
means the area in which you can receive

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.840 
means the area in which you can receive
satellite<00:03:20.150> TV<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:21.190> drastically<00:03:22.190> reduced<00:03:22.609> and

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
satellite TV is drastically reduced and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.390 
satellite TV is drastically reduced and
we<00:03:22.910> think<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.620> when<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.769> changes<00:03:25.190> actually

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
we think that when the changes actually

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.729 
we think that when the changes actually
happen<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.060> system<00:03:26.750> like<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.170> will<00:03:27.470> be<00:03:27.590> able

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
happen a system like this will be able

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.159 
happen a system like this will be able
to<00:03:27.859> receive<00:03:28.160> all<00:03:28.370> British<00:03:28.699> TV<00:03:28.910> maybe<00:03:29.780> as<00:03:29.930> far

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
to receive all British TV maybe as far

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.730 
to receive all British TV maybe as far
south<00:03:30.199> as<00:03:30.519> Bordeaux<00:03:31.570> however<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:32.930> not

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
south as Bordeaux however it's not

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.250 
south as Bordeaux however it's not
a<00:03:33.800> serious<00:03:34.610> problem<00:03:34.880> okay<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> serious

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
a serious problem okay it is a serious

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.450 
a serious problem okay it is a serious
problem<00:03:36.320> it's<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.920> end<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.250> world

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
problem it's not the end of the world

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.800 
problem it's not the end of the world
because<00:03:38.000> there<00:03:38.240> are<00:03:38.330> lots<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.660> other

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
within the space of a few months I think

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.150

that<00:05:03.320> there<00:05:03.440> might<00:05:03.530> be<00:05:03.590> some<00:05:03.860> very

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
that there might be some very
