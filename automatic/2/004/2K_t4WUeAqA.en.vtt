00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.730
 there we will see how to train a 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.230
 Budgerigar you need a lot of advance 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 patience, I'm going to leave some things 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 you can not do at any time and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.470
 never grid with your black never take off 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 gross form and speaking however not four 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.099
 sudden movements 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.960
 never been told to do something you want 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.290
 if you want to scale it at most 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.940
 bursting and bursting 20 minutes 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.610
 training 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.030
 if he has the feathers of the great 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.520
 by leaving a video of how to cut and how 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.520
 count the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:01.469
 then take it in the quiet place in the room 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.489
 for example I get the small pot of ration 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.420
 in the hand and with the parakeet in the same 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.170
 no, not because she eats 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170
 first 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:37.439
 let him usually be restless 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:41.700
 if he stays fast expect a 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:47.070
 and asks for calmness by trying to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 He's talking food very softly. 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:56.040
 getting it in your hand 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.140
 have to be caring and always in a 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:05.250
 place of the body that he can come 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.729
 It was worth it when gradually to places and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.690
 few more agitated in Syria each 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.420
 so he adapts to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:22.380
 environment that is not afraid of everything 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.160
 or if you want to get a cloth with 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.940
 very careful and approaching being 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.130
 said and picked up in one place plus increases 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:42.450
 dark and place the floor on the head 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.310
 him caressing and puts down 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.170
 him on his lap or finger and do it 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.230
 every day 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:03:01.040
 talk to him quite well 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:05.270
 it's the same procedure as a calopsita 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.630
 much more but time consuming 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:13.380
 the cheese then ours in sales at 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.780
 next chapter to see how Cortazar 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.780
 of a parakeet bye
