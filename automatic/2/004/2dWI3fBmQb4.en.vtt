 all kinds of prejudice is that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.610
 there could be prejudices that do not have a 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.670
 homosexual daughter who shows up in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.660

 aunt the pseudo had someone I created 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 and he will then be part of this 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.810
 family 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.450
 I have a neighbor in this family. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 that the divine light that is said of crazy 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.880
 that is said crazy moves and is said to be 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.119
 treated is said to be diagnosed only 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 have money to buy the medication 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.150
 So she remembers with a lot of affection. 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 when she's done therapy with 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.979
 because she felt that the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.000
 from that moment on she improved 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.280
 very 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.229
 so it's a way I have to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
 show that there is no 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.079
 prejudice against how much this 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.240
 electroconvulsive therapy and also 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.649
 show that people from 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.579
 when they assume their illness 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.399
 mental 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.799
 before society they can be more 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.739
 well accepted and we can also help 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.380
 if you say mentally ill people will 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.020
 scared by the disease that is the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.290
 psychiatric illness because it shows itself 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.240
 as well as the dermatological and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.580
 then this causes a certain strangeness 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.770
 who watches because everyone wants to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.440
 hide their illness when in 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 reality that you are sick is a 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.390
 step of healing because it is the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.400
