00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:15.170 

you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.940 

these<00:01:16.180> literally<00:01:16.720> are<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.170> shapes<00:01:17.470> really

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
these literally are just shapes really

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.980 
these literally are just shapes really
and<00:01:18.250> if<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.640> were<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.970> cut<00:01:19.240> these<00:01:19.420> out<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.840> place

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
and if I were to cut these out and place

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.390 
and if I were to cut these out and place
them<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.290> white<00:01:20.560> piece<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.800> paper<00:01:20.950> you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
them on a white piece of paper you

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.160 
them on a white piece of paper you
wouldn't<00:01:21.700> have<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.850> clue<00:01:22.090> what<00:01:22.390> they<00:01:22.570> were<00:01:22.600> but

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
wouldn't have a clue what they were but

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.410 
wouldn't have a clue what they were but
because<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.040> whole<00:01:24.220> scene<00:01:24.550> is<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> bow<00:01:25.390> tie

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
because the whole scene is is a bow tie

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.770 
because the whole scene is is a bow tie
sort<00:01:25.870> of<00:01:26.020> seeing<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.590> river<00:01:27.250> scene<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.540> just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
sort of seeing the river scene you just

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.690 
sort of seeing the river scene you just
assume<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.260> these<00:01:29.410> dark<00:01:29.740> shapes<00:01:30.130> will<00:01:30.460> be

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
assume that these dark shapes will be

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.080 
assume that these dark shapes will be
our<00:01:31.120> boats<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:32.140> as<00:01:32.740> soon<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:33.010> I<00:01:33.100> put<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.340> mast<00:01:33.700> in

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
our boats and as soon as I put a mast in

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.830 
our boats and as soon as I put a mast in
on<00:01:34.240> them<00:01:35.670> they've<00:01:36.670> cut<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:37.120> comes<00:01:37.360> obvious

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
on them they've cut it comes obvious

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.220 
on them they've cut it comes obvious
that<00:01:38.020> they<00:01:38.170> are<00:01:38.350> boats<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.810> their<00:01:40.990> boats

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
that they are boats but their boats

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.740 
that they are boats but their boats
without<00:01:41.440> any<00:01:41.800> any<00:01:42.190> details<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.720> eye

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
without any any details so the eye

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.660 
without any any details so the eye
doesn't<00:01:44.080> dwell<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.500> them<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:44.890> takes<00:01:45.370> them

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
doesn't dwell on them it just takes them

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.370 
doesn't dwell on them it just takes them
in<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:45.970> then<00:01:46.090> moves<00:01:46.300> on<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.660> next<00:01:46.930> part<00:01:47.140> of

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
in and then moves on to the next part of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.910 
in and then moves on to the next part of
the<00:01:47.470> painting<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.940> painting<00:01:49.920> basically

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
the painting the painting basically

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.960 
the painting the painting basically
relies<00:01:51.250> on<00:01:52.140> light<00:01:53.140> shapes<00:01:53.640> against<00:01:54.640> dark

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
relies on light shapes against dark

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.010 
relies on light shapes against dark
shows<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:57.150> think<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.270> arts<00:01:58.510> are<00:01:58.600> putting<00:01:58.900> in

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
shows I think the arts are putting in

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.960 
shows I think the arts are putting in
windows<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.680> not<00:01:59.710> to<00:02:00.009> put<00:02:00.220> them<00:02:00.369> all<00:02:00.580> in

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
windows is not to put them all in

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.240 
windows is not to put them all in
exactly<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.840> same<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.619> inexperienced

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
exactly the same the inexperienced

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.100 
exactly the same the inexperienced
painter<00:02:03.700> tends<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.090> just<00:02:04.270> paint<00:02:04.479> them<00:02:04.660> all<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
painter tends to just paint them all the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.910 
painter tends to just paint them all the
same<00:02:05.140> color<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.009> same<00:02:06.250> tone<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:08.320> makes<00:02:08.619> for

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
same color the same tone it makes for

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.889 
same color the same tone it makes for
much<00:02:09.009> more<00:02:09.250> interesting<00:02:09.759> composition<00:02:10.600> if<00:02:10.750> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
much more interesting composition if you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.890 
much more interesting composition if you
can<00:02:11.110> vary<00:02:11.470> some<00:02:11.860> dark<00:02:12.160> some<00:02:12.610> light<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.690> just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
can vary some dark some light you just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.480 
can vary some dark some light you just
really<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:14.560> your<00:02:14.709> own<00:02:14.770> thing<00:02:14.890> with<00:02:15.459> it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
really have to do your own thing with it

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.880 
really have to do your own thing with it
and<00:02:15.730> not<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.390> copy<00:02:16.720> what's<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.350> front<00:02:17.620> of

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and not really copy what's in front of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.420 
and not really copy what's in front of
you<00:02:19.320> these<00:02:20.320> windows<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.739> pretty<00:02:21.310> dark<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:23.430> think

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
you these windows a pretty dark I think

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.300 
you these windows a pretty dark I think
I<00:02:24.489> can<00:02:24.670> start<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.300> get<00:02:25.480> some<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.680> bottom

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
I can start to get some of the bottom

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.710 
I can start to get some of the bottom
windows<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:28.030> now<00:02:30.330> I've<00:02:31.330> got<00:02:32.370> reasonably<00:02:33.370> dark

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
windows in now I've got reasonably dark

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.380 
windows in now I've got reasonably dark
light<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.620> i<00:02:35.650> feel<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.160> needs<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.670> be<00:02:36.820> quite

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
light so i feel that needs to be quite

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.330 
light so i feel that needs to be quite
quite<00:02:37.750> strong<00:02:38.140> down<00:02:38.410> there<00:02:38.680> even<00:02:39.010> though<00:02:39.190> it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
quite strong down there even though it

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.800 
quite strong down there even though it
is<00:02:39.370> reasonably<00:02:40.180> light<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:41.709> reality<00:02:42.160> i<00:02:45.810> quite

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
is reasonably light in reality i quite

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.840 
is reasonably light in reality i quite
like<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.170> way<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.350> working<00:02:47.470> where<00:02:47.950> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
like this way of working where the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.340 
like this way of working where the
previous<00:02:49.690> wash<00:02:50.370> provides<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.790> base<00:02:52.060> for<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
previous wash provides the base for the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.220 
previous wash provides the base for the
next<00:02:53.769> wash<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:55.000> me<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.269> seems<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.810> quite<00:02:56.140> a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
next wash to me it seems to be quite a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.470 
next wash to me it seems to be quite a
good<00:02:56.470> way<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.620> working<00:02:56.920> because<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.459> keeps<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
good way of working because it keeps the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.960 
good way of working because it keeps the
colors<00:02:58.930> in<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.200> same<00:02:59.470> family<00:03:00.280> really<00:03:00.760> you're

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
colors in the same family really you're

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.910 
colors in the same family really you're
not<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.180> mixing<00:03:01.810> completely<00:03:02.290> new<00:03:02.470> colors

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
not just mixing completely new colors

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.729 
not just mixing completely new colors
all<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.310> time<00:03:03.519> one<00:03:04.269> color<00:03:04.570> leads<00:03:04.989> on<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
all the time one color leads on to the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.250 
all the time one color leads on to the
next<00:03:05.980> thing<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:07.360> remember<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.870> you're<00:03:08.110> doing

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
next thing to remember is you're doing

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.780 
next thing to remember is you're doing
the<00:03:08.470> painting<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:09.100> yourself<00:03:09.459> you're<00:03:09.730> not

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
the painting for yourself you're not

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.040 
the painting for yourself you're not
trying<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.620> copy<00:03:11.620> exactly<00:03:11.980> what's<00:03:12.459> there

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
trying to copy exactly what's there

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.310 
trying to copy exactly what's there
it's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.740> great<00:03:14.040> fun<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:15.080> extremely<00:03:16.080> rewarding

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
it's a great fun and extremely rewarding

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.470 
it's a great fun and extremely rewarding
so<00:03:17.180> all<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.270> can<00:03:18.510> say<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.660> good<00:03:18.810> painting
