down<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> structure<00:02:26.590> there's<00:02:27.590> four<00:02:27.860> phases

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
down the structure there's four phases

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.490 
down the structure there's four phases
to<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> program<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.540> first<00:02:29.750> phase<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
to the program the first phase is the

accumulate in these areas and the last
and<00:02:55.700> final<00:02:55.880> phase<00:02:56.240> space<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.710> goal

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
and final phase space for and the goal

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.750 
and final phase space for and the goal
here<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.880> achieve<00:02:59.080> six-pack<00:03:00.080> abs<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.800> in
