00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
system or are they open to that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.080 
system or are they open to that
possibility<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:14.150> one<00:03:14.420> interpretation

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.160 

production<00:03:18.090> from<00:03:18.180> new<00:03:18.420> mines<00:03:18.660> will<00:03:18.990> likely

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
production from new mines will likely

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.809 
production from new mines will likely
decline<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.800> in<00:03:19.920> addition<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> supply

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
decline so in addition to all the supply

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.400 
decline so in addition to all the supply
for<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.180> excuse<00:03:21.690> me<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> demand<00:03:22.230> factors

that we outline thus far in this video

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.479 
that we outline thus far in this video
there's<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.050> issue<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.500> production<00:03:26.130> from

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
there's the issue that production from

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.600 
there's the issue that production from
new<00:03:26.700> mines<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:28.440> likely<00:03:28.860> decline<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.550> year

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
new mines is is likely decline this year

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.360 
new mines is is likely decline this year
2012<00:03:30.360> could<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.319> sort<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.860> know<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.130> peak

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
2012 could be sort of you know the peak

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.300 
2012 could be sort of you know the peak
as<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.270> Chardon<00:03:33.630> screen<00:03:33.989> illustrates

a<00:03:36.900> very<00:03:37.900> small<00:03:38.170> market<00:03:38.770> there's<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.980> bunch<00:03:39.220> of

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
a very small market there's a bunch of

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.370 
a very small market there's a bunch of
examples<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:40.300> this<00:03:40.450> but<00:03:40.720> basically<00:03:40.989> one

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
examples of this but basically one

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.600 
examples of this but basically one
percent<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.489> u.s.<00:03:42.520> m1<00:03:43.239> money<00:03:43.510> supply<00:03:43.930> is

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
percent of the u.s. m1 money supply is

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.120 
percent of the u.s. m1 money supply is
13<00:03:45.610> times<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.989> amount<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.380> all<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.890> gold

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
13 times the amount of all the gold

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.520 
13 times the amount of all the gold
coins<00:03:48.310> purchased<00:03:48.880> last<00:03:49.300> year<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.349> really

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
coins purchased last year so it really

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.620 
coins purchased last year so it really
doesn't<00:03:50.709> take<00:03:50.860> much<00:03:51.190> for<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.910> know<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.450> money

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
doesn't take much for you know the money
