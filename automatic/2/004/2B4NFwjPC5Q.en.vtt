and shape here in the tea shop really
what<00:00:45.190> is<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.430> important<00:00:45.940> is<00:00:46.089> we're<00:00:46.420> in<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.570> very

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
what is so important is we're in a very

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.240 
what is so important is we're in a very
linear<00:00:47.230> kind<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.190> boxcar<00:00:48.970> shape<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:50.680> wanted

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
linear kind of boxcar shape and I wanted

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.570 
linear kind of boxcar shape and I wanted
to<00:00:51.309> bring<00:00:51.579> in<00:00:51.760> an<00:00:51.909> element<00:00:52.479> of<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:53.049> circle<00:00:53.580> the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
to bring in an element of the circle the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.700 
to bring in an element of the circle the
circle<00:00:54.610> of<00:00:55.059> community<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.989> you<00:00:56.140> might<00:00:56.350> find

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
circle of community that you might find

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.189 
circle of community that you might find
in<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.489> yurt<00:00:57.879> or<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:59.320> Kiva<00:01:00.309> or<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:01.330> teepee

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
in a yurt or a Kiva or a teepee

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.439 
in a yurt or a Kiva or a teepee
so<00:01:02.470> that<00:01:02.619> there<00:01:02.769> was<00:01:02.830> a<00:01:02.890> sense<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.250> intimacy<00:01:03.580> so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
so that there was a sense of intimacy so

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.359 
so that there was a sense of intimacy so
underneath<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.989> skylight<00:01:05.409> here<00:01:05.650> we<00:01:06.130> brought

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
underneath the skylight here we brought

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.210 
underneath the skylight here we brought
in<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.909> idea<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.630> circle<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.439> what

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
in the idea of the circle and what

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.050 
in the idea of the circle and what
better<00:01:09.540> material<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:11.110> use<00:01:11.470> than<00:01:11.830> concrete<00:01:12.340> to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
better material to use than concrete to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.950 
better material to use than concrete to
shape<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.900> circle<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.330> center<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:16.689> this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
shape a circle and at the center of this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.880 
shape a circle and at the center of this
is<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.829> tea<00:01:17.979> bar<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:19.000> tea<00:01:19.150> bar<00:01:19.360> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
is the tea bar and the tea bar is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.219 
is the tea bar and the tea bar is
following<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.100> shape<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.630> traditional

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
following the shape of this traditional

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.370 
following the shape of this traditional
guy<00:01:23.439> wan<00:01:23.710> which<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.340> tea<00:01:24.850> serving<00:01:25.380> vessel

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
guy wan which is a tea serving vessel

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.399 
guy wan which is a tea serving vessel
and<00:01:26.740> you'll<00:01:27.580> notice<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.150> curved<00:01:28.720> shape<00:01:28.750> here

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
and you'll notice the curved shape here

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.780 
and you'll notice the curved shape here
and<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.860> took<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.460> shape<00:01:31.360> as<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:33.040> inspiration

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
and I took this shape as the inspiration

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.270 
and I took this shape as the inspiration
for<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.180> shape<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.600> tea<00:01:34.780> bar<00:01:35.130> around<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
for the shape of the tea bar around the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.000 
for the shape of the tea bar around the
central<00:01:36.760> form<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.720> tea<00:01:37.930> bar<00:01:38.170> we<00:01:38.860> have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
central form of the tea bar we have

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.700 
central form of the tea bar we have
concentric<00:01:39.729> rings<00:01:40.180> sort<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:40.990> established<00:01:41.560> by

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
concentric rings sort of established by

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.430 
concentric rings sort of established by
the<00:01:41.770> floor<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.700> by<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.210> walls<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:44.260> by<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
the floor and by the walls and by the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.310 
the floor and by the walls and by the
shelving<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.570> emphasized<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.900> idea<00:01:47.260> of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
shelving that emphasized this idea of

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.580 
shelving that emphasized this idea of
the<00:01:47.409> circle<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:48.430> also<00:01:48.580> draws<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.870> customer<00:01:50.409> in

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the circle it also draws the customer in

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.850 
the circle it also draws the customer in
to<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.640> center<00:01:52.409> starting<00:01:53.409> with<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.620> floor

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
to the center starting with the floor

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.469 
to the center starting with the floor
for<00:01:54.070> example<00:01:54.190> we<00:01:54.580> have<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.850> self-leveling

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
for example we have the self-leveling

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.020 
for example we have the self-leveling
concrete<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:56.020> green<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:57.280> ringed<00:01:57.729> with

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
concrete in green and it's ringed with

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.870 
concrete in green and it's ringed with
this<00:01:58.540> brass<00:01:58.930> edge<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.220> contrasts<00:02:00.850> with

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
this brass edge and that contrasts with

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.500 
this brass edge and that contrasts with
the<00:02:01.000> black<00:02:01.500> Brazilian<00:02:02.500> slate<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.270> Shelf

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
the black Brazilian slate in the Shelf

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.530 
the black Brazilian slate in the Shelf
we<00:02:05.290> have<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> curved<00:02:06.220> gray<00:02:06.700> concrete<00:02:07.299> cast

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
we have a curved gray concrete cast

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.270 
we have a curved gray concrete cast
shelf<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:08.080> sort<00:02:08.259> of<00:02:08.289> cantilevers<00:02:08.950> out<00:02:09.099> from

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
shelf that sort of cantilevers out from

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880 
shelf that sort of cantilevers out from
the<00:02:09.369> wall<00:02:09.580> also<00:02:10.030> sort<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.869> skirting<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
the wall also sort of skirting you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.369 
the wall also sort of skirting you
around<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.370> t-bar<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.629> then<00:02:13.840> at<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.140> backend

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
around the t-bar and then at the backend

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.369 
around the t-bar and then at the backend
where<00:02:14.920> our<00:02:15.129> connoisseur<00:02:16.030> tea<00:02:16.629> ware<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.049> kept

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
where our connoisseur tea ware is kept

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.460 
where our connoisseur tea ware is kept
we<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:17.920> another<00:02:18.159> curve

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
we have another curve

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.760 
we have another curve
that<00:02:19.620> sort<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.100> echoes<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.910> same<00:02:21.360> curve<00:02:21.960> so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that sort of echoes that same curve so

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.120 
that sort of echoes that same curve so
these<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.880> idea<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.420> reinforcing<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.410> curve

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
these this idea of reinforcing the curve

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.160 
these this idea of reinforcing the curve
kind<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.850> brings<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.570> sets<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.050> an
