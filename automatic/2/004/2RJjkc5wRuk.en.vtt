00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 Today, Minderjahn says great people thank you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.970
 yet they have turned on today shows 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.920
 you from a tram so friendly 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.539
 show from a completely different side 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 squats or poor's short 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.170
 accomplished 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.009
 that means for stability 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 muscle strength which also shit can 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.360
 her the classic post short man 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.360
 goes down and keeps showing ours 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 the classic olympia go down 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.290
 and sit down in this position 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.060
 and again today we want 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.770
 really stabilize the customer 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.400
 coordinate and that I show you 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.090
 now it was quads of a very different 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.240
 time and completely whole times 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.240
 underneath 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.280
 The goal now is to go under 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.280
 not suspend 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.880
 So far that means you are not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.100
 on the back and in this position 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:42.819
 Baumann thrilling extensive hold exciting 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:45.590
 Five seconds back up that, above all 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:48.020
 for many today in the context of 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.420
 Squats on the right side to produce and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.240
 then march out obmann 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.670
 we exclude that theirs 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.560
 possible stability has the whole 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.409
 house lying and there we can with the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.189
 upper body connects and bombproof 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.140
 weaknesses 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.360
 Just try the post office 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.610
 Now I'll show you more effective ones 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.970
 had if for example to apply or 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.930
 Towels are not a wide and though 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.110
 The bottle looked with him 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.110
 Wine 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.819
 and who there 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.980
 where usually their shoulders 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.980
 has and you go here with you to find 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.430
 the beautiful tight 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 the rod that you have to first course 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.430
 stabilize times 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.640
 and now the same game as you husband 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.989
 wore and go down 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.989
 do not settle 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.730
 then of course I would have to do that then 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.680
 accustom 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.710
 if you do not have a fight today 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.200
 as well as towels live about it 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.070
 would hold the same game and after 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.230
 tighten down 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.270
 the advantage here or disadvantage is 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.710
 that we have less stability up here 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.360
 that means you have to do much more 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.970
 focus on that you really 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.800
 here stabilize four city drawn 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.200
 but you have're up here as I 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.620
 just look that was stuck through the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.410
 belt 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.160
 but it does attract many if stabilize 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.630
 you do not want to go down then 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.550
 he must be firm 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.440
 that the hull is stabilized that is 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.820
 not fit and we can do that 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.400
 For example, if you finished squats 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.820
 you made from 100 or 120 times sat 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.070
 Take 70 kilos 60 I'll tell you that 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.100
 is exhausting and keep five 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.190
 seconds back up 500 apartments five 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.530
 sentences and I tell you you will 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.670
 men have never stabilized at the euro 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.959
 before that , I hope that was 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.470
 clearly or I make it clear what 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.090
 I wanted to show 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.470
 I hope I can not help it up 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.470
 to the next video
