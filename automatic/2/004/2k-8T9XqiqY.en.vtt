00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

now<00:00:00.210> we<00:00:00.269> are<00:00:00.450> looking<00:00:00.510> at<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:01.070> z87<00:00:02.070> pro<00:00:02.639> so

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
now we are looking at the z87 pro so

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.430 
now we are looking at the z87 pro so
it's<00:00:03.030> actually<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.360> more<00:00:03.659> mainstream<00:00:03.959> but

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
it's actually a more mainstream but

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.880 
it's actually a more mainstream but
higher<00:00:04.650> NS<00:00:05.040> or<00:00:05.190> pen<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.879> z87<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.049> C<00:00:07.259> so

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
higher NS or pen to the z87 a and C so

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.180 
higher NS or pen to the z87 a and C so
the<00:00:08.849> Israelis<00:00:09.750> there's<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.440> one-step<00:00:10.980> feature

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the Israelis there's a one-step feature

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400 
the Israelis there's a one-step feature
that<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.759> can<00:00:11.849> see<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.630> know<00:00:12.660> there's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that you can see that you know there's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.870 
that you can see that you know there's
so<00:00:13.469> definitely<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.980> higher-end<00:00:14.700> models

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
so definitely a higher-end models

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.599 
so definitely a higher-end models
compared<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> previous<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.490> firstly<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
compared to the previous one firstly the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.429 
compared to the previous one firstly the
door<00:00:17.820> intelligent<00:00:18.300> processor<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.289> you're

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
door intelligent processor for so you're

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
door intelligent processor for so you're
getting<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.949> best<00:00:19.980> digital<00:00:20.670> performance<00:00:21.449> or

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
getting the best digital performance or

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.170 
getting the best digital performance or
in<00:00:21.779> terms<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.080> circuitry<00:00:22.769> design<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.850> this

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
in terms of circuitry design in this

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.580 
in terms of circuitry design in this
motherboard<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.869> let's<00:00:25.109> take<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.289> look<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.500> this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
motherboard so let's take a look at this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.089 
motherboard so let's take a look at this
matter<00:00:25.830> spot<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> whole<00:00:27.029> overview<00:00:28.099> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
matter spot as a whole overview and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.769 
matter spot as a whole overview and
firstly<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> high-end

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
firstly you can see it's a high-end

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
firstly you can see it's a high-end
market<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.369> when

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
market where you can see you when

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.520 
market where you can see you when
there's<00:00:32.759> LED<00:00:33.090> postcodes<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.930> well<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> on

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
there's LED postcodes as well as the on

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.100 
there's LED postcodes as well as the on
button<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.489> definitely<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.329> features<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> i

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
button so definitely not features that i

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
button so definitely not features that i
just<00:00:37.530> had<00:00:37.770> seen<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.190> entry-level<00:00:38.489> model<00:00:38.940> box

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
just had seen in entry-level model box

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
just had seen in entry-level model box
so<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.940> bios<00:00:41.940> flash<00:00:42.059> back<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
so we also have bios flash back so we

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
so we also have bios flash back so we
can<00:00:43.440> flash<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.800> bios<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> bios

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
can flash your bios if there is a bios

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
can flash your bios if there is a bios

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
overclocking so let's take a look we

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.580 
overclocking so let's take a look we
have<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.610> first<00:01:24.820> PCI<00:01:25.600> Express<00:01:25.840> x1<00:01:26.320> slot

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
have the first PCI Express x1 slot

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.750 
have the first PCI Express x1 slot
followed<00:01:27.220> by<00:01:27.370> x16<00:01:28.060> this<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.360> full<00:01:28.600> x.x<00:01:28.900> in<00:01:29.110> slot

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
followed by x16 this is full x.x in slot

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.070 
followed by x16 this is full x.x in slot
fits<00:01:30.760> both<00:01:30.940> physically<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.450> electrically

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
fits both physically and electrically

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.670 
fits both physically and electrically
then<00:01:32.410> we<00:01:32.590> have<00:01:32.950> two<00:01:33.280> more<00:01:33.550> feet<00:01:34.270> pcie<00:01:34.780> x1<00:01:35.380> slots

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
then we have two more feet pcie x1 slots

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.670 
then we have two more feet pcie x1 slots
as<00:01:35.860> well<00:01:36.040> as<00:01:36.160> another<00:01:36.840> pci<00:01:37.840> express<00:01:38.320> x16

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
as well as another pci express x16

can<00:01:42.430> see<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.880> pizza<00:01:43.300> only<00:01:43.570> witches<00:01:43.750> here<00:01:44.080> then

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
can see the pizza only witches here then

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.110 
can see the pizza only witches here then
lastly<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.490> this

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
lastly we have this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.110 
lastly we have this
another<00:01:47.480> PCI<00:01:47.750> x1<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:48.860> believe<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.700> both

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
another PCI x1 so I believe this is both

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.590 
another PCI x1 so I believe this is both
in<00:01:50.770> sli<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:51.920> well<00:01:52.070> as<00:01:52.250> across<00:01:52.580> Wyatt<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.420> let's

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
in sli as well as across Wyatt so let's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.680 
in sli as well as across Wyatt so let's
look<00:01:53.810> at<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.020> site<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.130> six<00:01:55.850> SATA

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
look at the site we have six SATA

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.200 
look at the site we have six SATA
siskiyou<00:01:57.050> because<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.470> can<00:01:57.700> connect<00:01:58.700> SATA

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210

chipset as well as an l2 which i guess
is<00:02:04.610> also<00:02:06.160> 60<00:02:07.160> because<00:02:07.430> again<00:02:07.730> based<00:02:08.030> on<00:02:08.270> a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
is also 60 because again based on a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.470 
is also 60 because again based on a
different<00:02:08.780> chipset<00:02:09.910> as<00:02:10.910> compared<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.390> the

lower although the lower end models you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.710 
lower although the lower end models you
can<00:02:14.360> see<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.260> heat<00:02:15.800> things<00:02:16.100> are<00:02:16.280> much

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
