00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
much as you do really I mean it's really

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.000 
much as you do really I mean it's really
in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> hands<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> riders<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.469> think

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
in the hands of the riders but I think

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.100 
in the hands of the riders but I think
it's<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.250> great<00:00:11.370> opportunity<00:00:11.700> for<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.750> really

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
it's a great opportunity for a really

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
it's a great opportunity for a really
interesting<00:00:13.410> storyline<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.340> season<00:00:14.700> 3<00:00:15.000> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
interesting storyline for season 3 I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
interesting storyline for season 3 I
mean<00:00:15.990> we're<00:00:16.109> not<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> open<00:00:16.560> season<00:00:16.890> 3<00:00:17.130> up

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
mean we're not going to open season 3 up

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.609 
mean we're not going to open season 3 up
with<00:00:17.520> them<00:00:17.940> coming<00:00:18.210> home<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:19.289> another

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
with them coming home with another

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950 
with them coming home with another
Vietnamese<00:00:20.130> baby<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.609> an<00:00:20.730> airplane<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.810> did

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
Vietnamese baby on an airplane as we did

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.820 
Vietnamese baby on an airplane as we did
in<00:00:21.990> season<00:00:22.410> 1<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.039> think<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.830> it's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
in season 1 but I think that it's it's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
in season 1 but I think that it's it's
interesting<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.490> never<00:00:26.640> saw<00:00:26.849> Cameron

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
interesting that we never saw Cameron

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.779 
interesting that we never saw Cameron
Mitchell<00:00:27.390> before<00:00:27.960> Lily<00:00:28.710> we've<00:00:29.070> only<00:00:29.580> known

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
Mitchell before Lily we've only known

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.040 
Mitchell before Lily we've only known
him<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.090> Lily's<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.929> what

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
him with Lily's so we don't know what

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
him with Lily's so we don't know what
that<00:00:31.080> struggle<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> adopt

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that struggle was like for them to adopt

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.750 
that struggle was like for them to adopt
another<00:00:33.450> baby<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.860> season<00:00:35.430> three<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
another baby so I think season three is

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
another baby so I think season three is
a<00:00:35.790> great<00:00:36.000> opportunity<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.570> maybe<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:37.110> what

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a great opportunity to maybe see what

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
a great opportunity to maybe see what
process<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.969> might<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.750> men<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.260> what

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
process that might have on men what what

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
process that might have on men what what
sort<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> told<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> might<00:00:41.610> take<00:00:41.790> off<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.180> them

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
sort of told that might take off on them

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
sort of told that might take off on them
how<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> rest<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> family

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
how do you think the rest of the family

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.760 
how do you think the rest of the family
would<00:00:44.399> react<00:00:44.930> well<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.640> mean<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:47.789> father<00:00:48.059> didn't

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
would react well I mean my father didn't

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
would react well I mean my father didn't
completely<00:00:49.770> accept<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> lily<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> little

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
completely accept the lily the little

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.930 
completely accept the lily the little
pot<00:00:51.329> sticker<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.670> off<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> bat

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
pot sticker you know right off the bat

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
pot sticker you know right off the bat
but<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.219> think<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> they<00:00:56.520> would

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
but I think that I think that they would

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
but I think that I think that they would
be<00:00:57.059> maybe<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:57.960> concerned<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.620> maybe

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
be maybe a little concerned that maybe

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.889 
be maybe a little concerned that maybe
were<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.789> over<00:00:59.879> over<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:00.750> head

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
were a little in over over our head

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.830 
were a little in over over our head
already<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:03.149> might<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.570> great<00:01:03.750> idea

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
already so it might not be a great idea

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
already so it might not be a great idea
but<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.880> they'd<00:01:06.090> be

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
but I think that I think that they'd be

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
but I think that I think that they'd be
excited<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.650> also<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> actors

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
excited about it I think also the actors

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
excited about it I think also the actors
themselves<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.740> excited<00:01:11.010> by<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
themselves are really excited by the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.899 
themselves are really excited by the
prospect<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.479> expanding<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> cast

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
prospect of you know expanding the cast

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.429 
prospect of you know expanding the cast
there<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.150> been<00:01:15.180> rumors<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.720> Lily<00:01:16.229> might

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
there have been rumors that Lily might

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
there have been rumors that Lily might
be<00:01:16.500> recast<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> future<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:17.970> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
were so vocal about it I mean it only

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.140 
were so vocal about it I mean it only
means<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.350> they<00:02:23.590> they're<00:02:23.950> invested<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
means that they they're invested in the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.520 
means that they they're invested in the
characters<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.630> they<00:02:25.840> love<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> characters

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.730 
characters and they love the characters
but<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.920> did<00:02:27.340> think<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.610> there<00:02:27.910> was<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.090> lot<00:02:28.300> of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
but I did think that there was a lot of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.260 
but I did think that there was a lot of
hoopla<00:02:29.740> over<00:02:29.860> nothing<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.670> thought<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.060> it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
hoopla over nothing I thought that it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.330 
hoopla over nothing I thought that it
was<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> bit<00:02:31.660> over<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> top<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.350> they<00:02:32.560> were<00:02:32.620> so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
was a bit over the top that they were so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160 
was a bit over the top that they were so
angry<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.970> hadn't<00:02:34.390> kissed<00:02:34.630> when<00:02:34.959> really

the show but I I really was very pleased
with<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.000> way<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.420> riders<00:02:55.720> dealt<00:02:55.989> with

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
with the way that the riders dealt with

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.290 
with the way that the riders dealt with
that<00:02:56.200> episode<00:02:56.650> Mitchell's<00:02:57.400> issues<00:02:58.150> with

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
that episode Mitchell's issues with

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.810 
that episode Mitchell's issues with
public<00:02:59.080> displays<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.410> affection<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.430> think

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
public displays of affection and I think

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.220 
public displays of affection and I think
it's<00:03:00.910> something<00:03:01.060> that's<00:03:01.269> very<00:03:01.330> real<00:03:01.720> wasn't<00:03:02.200> a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it's something that's very real wasn't a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's something that's very real wasn't a
comp<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.650> our<00:03:02.800> wasn't<00:03:03.130> like<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.310> was<00:03:03.370> trying<00:03:03.610> to

comp at our wasn't like I was trying to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160 
comp at our wasn't like I was trying to
get<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:03.940> situation<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:05.050> that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
get out of situation I think that that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.170 
get out of situation I think that that
was<00:03:05.290> always<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.980> plan<00:03:06.100> for<00:03:06.700> them<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.970> have<00:03:07.150> a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
storyline that dealt with Mitchell's

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.090 
storyline that dealt with Mitchell's
uptightness<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:11.080> apart<00:03:11.410> from<00:03:11.440> expanding<00:03:12.010> his
