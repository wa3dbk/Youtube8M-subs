00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
I'm just hoping it's not going to be

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.660 
I'm just hoping it's not going to be
somewhere<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.070> have<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.310> keep<00:04:11.459> on

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
somewhere like you have to keep on

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.220 
somewhere like you have to keep on
fighting<00:04:12.060> your<00:04:12.180> enemy<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:12.690> that's<00:04:13.019> when

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
fighting your enemy and that's when
