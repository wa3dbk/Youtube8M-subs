00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
even the reflection from the lights

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.119 
even the reflection from the lights
behind<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.019> joystick<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.500> can<00:03:53.709> see<00:03:53.919> right

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
behind the joystick you can see right

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.390 
behind the joystick you can see right
through<00:03:54.159> it<00:03:54.489> man<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:56.079> thing<00:03:56.319> is<00:03:56.349> no<00:03:56.799> joke

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.700 
when you take the joystick out this
looks<00:05:09.160> like<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:10.509> screw<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.440> comes<00:05:11.620> with

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
looks like the screw that it comes with

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.600 
looks like the screw that it comes with
so<00:05:11.949> that<00:05:12.099> you<00:05:12.220> can<00:05:12.400> actually<00:05:13.380> go<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.580> can

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
so that you can actually go so you can

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.570 
so that you can actually go so you can
take<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.849> apart<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.240> take<00:05:16.449> the<00:05:17.340> ball<00:05:18.340> off<00:05:18.550> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
take it apart and take the ball off the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.469 
take it apart and take the ball off the
joystick<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.389> show<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:20.289> how<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.500> set<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.830> up

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
joystick and show you how to set it up

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.339 
joystick and show you how to set it up
so<00:05:22.479> I'm<00:05:22.570> guessing<00:05:22.870> that's<00:05:22.960> what<00:05:23.139> those

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
so I'm guessing that's what those

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.260 
so I'm guessing that's what those
styrofoam<00:05:23.889> pieces<00:05:24.310> are<00:05:24.550> on<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.759> inside<00:05:25.090> is

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
styrofoam pieces are on the inside is

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.409 
styrofoam pieces are on the inside is
that<00:05:25.300> you<00:05:25.479> can<00:05:25.630> put<00:05:25.810> these<00:05:26.080> little<00:05:27.419> I'm

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
that you can put these little I'm

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.210 
that you can put these little I'm
guessing<00:05:28.840> this<00:05:28.900> yep<00:05:29.110> it's<00:05:29.349> the<00:05:29.620> screwdriver

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
guessing this yep it's the screwdriver

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.890 
guessing this yep it's the screwdriver
and<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.550> bits<00:05:30.789> you<00:05:31.000> can<00:05:31.300> actually<00:05:31.449> fit<00:05:31.780> inside

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
and the bits you can actually fit inside

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.629 
and the bits you can actually fit inside
the<00:05:32.409> controller<00:05:32.800> so<00:05:32.919> if<00:05:33.159> you're<00:05:33.280> traveling

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
the controller so if you're traveling

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.589 
the controller so if you're traveling
with<00:05:33.789> it<00:05:34.139> you<00:05:35.139> can<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:36.880> can<00:05:36.909> fix<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.270> on<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.449> go

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
with it you can you can fix it on the go

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.300 
with it you can you can fix it on the go
