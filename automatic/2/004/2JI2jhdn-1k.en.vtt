00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
relaxing it actually isn't relaxing it's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.250 
relaxing it actually isn't relaxing it's
more<00:00:28.830> she<00:00:29.310> said<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.760> more<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.269> taking

more she said it's more like taking

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.540 
more she said it's more like taking
whatever<00:00:33.320> grade<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.649> hair<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.370> going

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
whatever grade your hair is and going

whatever grade your hair is and going
down<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> grade<00:00:36.350> using<00:00:37.350> yogurt<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> some

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
down a grade using yogurt and some

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.900 
down a grade using yogurt and some
coconut<00:00:40.890> cream<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.730> coconut<00:00:42.000> oil<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.910> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
coconut cream and coconut oil and you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.180 
coconut cream and coconut oil and you
know<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> certain<00:00:46.079> proportions<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.950> thought

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
know in certain proportions so I thought

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
know in certain proportions so I thought
it<00:00:47.520> looked<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> good<00:00:48.090> idea<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.600> thought

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it looked like a good idea and I thought

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:49.490 
it looked like a good idea and I thought
I'd<00:00:48.960> try<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I'd try it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.360 
I'd try it
I<00:00:49.700> really<00:00:50.700> am<00:00:51.239> against<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> chemicals<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I really am against the chemicals as you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.410 
I really am against the chemicals as you
know<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:55.309> with<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> length<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.969> hair<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
know but with the length of my hair as

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
know but with the length of my hair as
it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.440> difficult<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it is it's really really difficult for

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.049 
it is it's really really difficult for
me<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:01.190> it's<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.670> all-day

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
me to do it and it's really an all-day

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
me to do it and it's really an all-day
project<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.619> takes<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.979> 8<00:01:05.369> hours

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
project right now it takes about 8 hours

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.359 
project right now it takes about 8 hours
for<00:01:05.909> me<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.450> wash<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.200> dry<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.299> know

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
for me to just wash and dry and you know

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
for me to just wash and dry and you know
put<00:01:11.369> apply<00:01:11.790> oil<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.510> braid<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
put apply oil and braid it and all of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.920 
put apply oil and braid it and all of
that<00:01:13.500> takes<00:01:13.950> over<00:01:14.310> 8<00:01:14.430> hours<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> thought

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that takes over 8 hours so I thought

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.510 
that takes over 8 hours so I thought
maybe<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.320> try<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.880> goes<00:01:18.409> I

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
maybe I try this and see how it goes I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
maybe I try this and see how it goes I
think<00:01:20.520> I've<00:01:20.909> mentioned<00:01:21.180> my<00:01:21.659> hair<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
think I've mentioned my hair is

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
this around the periphery is 4b 4c and

right<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> crown<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.329> bit

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
right at the crown I have a little bit

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870 
right at the crown I have a little bit
of<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.650> wave<00:01:40.860> pattern<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
of a more of a wave pattern to it I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
of a more of a wave pattern to it I
don't<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.930> would<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.259> called<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
don't know what that would be called and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
don't know what that would be called and
in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> nape<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.899> hair

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
was like a supermarket brand so I ended

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.110 
was like a supermarket brand so I ended
up<00:02:38.100> getting<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.580> Greek<00:02:38.820> Greek<00:02:40.340> yogurt<00:02:44.120> it's

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
acidophilus in it and I think that she

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.250 
acidophilus in it and I think that she
said<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.520> an<00:02:53.880> important<00:02:54.720> aspect<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.140> it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
said that's an important aspect to it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.040 
said that's an important aspect to it
it's<00:02:55.830> eight<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.310> ten<00:02:56.550> ounces<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.690> yogurt

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
it's eight to ten ounces of the yogurt

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.010 
it's eight to ten ounces of the yogurt
plus

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.350 

and<00:03:03.860> I'll<00:03:03.980> put<00:03:04.190> her<00:03:04.340> link<00:03:04.580> down<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.060> bottom

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
and I'll put her link down to the bottom

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.600 
and I'll put her link down to the bottom
because<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.690> don't<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:07.040> proportions

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
because I don't have the the proportions

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.630 
because I don't have the the proportions
right<00:03:07.820> in<00:03:07.910> front<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.180> me<00:03:08.240> but<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.640> coconut
