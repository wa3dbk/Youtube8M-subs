00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you'll notice it generates my brick wall

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.130 
you'll notice it generates my brick wall
but<00:03:14.280> here<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.940> did<00:03:15.120> something<00:03:15.390> funny<00:03:15.750> with<00:03:15.990> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
but here it did something funny with the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.080 
but here it did something funny with the
roof<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.590> has<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.800> little<00:03:17.040> exposed<00:03:17.459> thing<00:03:17.850> and

roof and has a little exposed thing and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.770 
roof and has a little exposed thing and
also<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.450> attic<00:03:18.840> wall<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.350> not<00:03:19.830> brick<00:03:20.780> well

also the attic wall is not brick well

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.750 
also the attic wall is not brick well
that's<00:03:21.959> because<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.650> had<00:03:22.800> generated<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.490> roof

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
that's because we had generated the roof

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.270 
that's because we had generated the roof
with<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.180> stucco<00:03:24.540> walls<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.650> simply<00:03:26.100> go

kind<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.310> cool<00:05:32.520> right<00:05:32.820> so<00:05:33.539> now<00:05:33.930> we<00:05:33.990> can<00:05:34.410> see<00:05:34.740> and

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
kind of cool right so now we can see and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.250 
kind of cool right so now we can see and
better<00:05:35.490> control<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.389> line<00:05:36.630> weights<00:05:36.990> that

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
better control the line weights that

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.920 
better control the line weights that
print<00:05:37.620> out<00:05:37.830> on<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.639> final<00:05:39.000> print<00:05:39.449> set<00:05:39.690> which

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
print out on the final print set which

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.230 
print out on the final print set which
is<00:05:40.080> very<00:05:40.349> handy<00:05:40.560> also<00:05:41.340> a<00:05:41.520> few<00:05:41.729> other<00:05:41.880> things<00:05:42.000> we

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
is very handy also a few other things we

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.469 
is very handy also a few other things we
can<00:05:42.479> do<00:05:42.570> in<00:05:42.840> this<00:05:43.260> elevation<00:05:43.740> tool<00:05:44.479> this

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
can do in this elevation tool this

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.870 
can do in this elevation tool this
elevation<00:05:46.050> view<00:05:46.349> excuse<00:05:46.800> me<00:05:46.979> this<00:05:47.400> part<00:05:47.760> of

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
elevation view excuse me this part of

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.820 
elevation view excuse me this part of
the<00:05:47.940> house<00:05:48.120> is<00:05:48.150> closer<00:05:48.720> than<00:05:49.139> that<00:05:49.440> part<00:05:49.770> of

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
the house is closer than that part of

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.649 
the house is closer than that part of
the<00:05:49.889> house<00:05:49.979> so<00:05:50.550> wouldn't<00:05:50.820> it<00:05:50.909> be<00:05:51.000> cool<00:05:51.210> if<00:05:51.240> this

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
the house so wouldn't it be cool if this

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.170 
the house so wouldn't it be cool if this
stays<00:05:52.020> nice<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:52.409> thick<00:05:52.949> and<00:05:53.250> these<00:05:53.760> lines

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
stays nice and thick and these lines

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.629 
stays nice and thick and these lines
maybe<00:05:54.630> get<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.169> little<00:05:55.199> thinner<00:05:55.770> well<00:05:56.370> we<00:05:56.490> can

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
maybe get a little thinner well we can

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.529 
maybe get a little thinner well we can
do<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.789> as<00:05:57.090> well

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
do that as well

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.189 
do that as well
I<00:05:57.919> can<00:05:58.919> go<00:05:59.070> to<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.340> Edit<00:05:59.760> layout<00:06:00.000> tool<00:06:00.449> and<00:06:00.750> I

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
I can go to the Edit layout tool and I

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.710 
I can go to the Edit layout tool and I
can<00:06:01.260> then<00:06:01.620> select<00:06:02.010> the<00:06:02.639> lines<00:06:02.909> I<00:06:03.240> don't<00:06:03.300> want

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
can then select the lines I don't want

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.740 
can then select the lines I don't want
to<00:06:03.840> be<00:06:03.990> so<00:06:04.229> thick<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:04.860> tone<00:06:05.460> them<00:06:05.729> down<00:06:05.760> let's

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
to be so thick and tone them down let's

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.430 
to be so thick and tone them down let's
say<00:06:06.930> we<00:06:07.080> take<00:06:07.260> these<00:06:07.470> down<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:08.010> maybe<00:06:08.190> 25

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
say we take these down to it maybe 25

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.010 
say we take these down to it maybe 25
select<00:06:10.440> that<00:06:10.620> line<00:06:11.419> click<00:06:12.419> in<00:06:12.599> here<00:06:12.810> select

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.219 
this line and pretty quickly you can see
I'm<00:06:18.510> changing<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:20.490> defaults<00:06:21.180> when<00:06:21.659> i<00:06:21.690> zoom<00:06:21.840> in

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
I'm changing the defaults when i zoom in

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.990 
I'm changing the defaults when i zoom in

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
other big thick line there it is we're

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.600 
other big thick line there it is we're
just<00:06:27.599> going<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.750> bring<00:06:28.169> them<00:06:28.320> on<00:06:28.470> down<00:06:28.800> now<00:06:29.580> I

notice in this one

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.110 
notice in this one
I<00:06:30.889> could<00:06:31.889> select<00:06:32.190> the<00:06:32.340> full<00:06:32.580> line<00:06:32.789> that<00:06:33.000> goes

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
I could select the full line that goes

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.730 
I could select the full line that goes
all<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.389> distance<00:06:34.110> and<00:06:34.320> I'm<00:06:34.380> just<00:06:34.500> going<00:06:34.650> to

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
all the distance and I'm just going to

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.989 
all the distance and I'm just going to
pull<00:06:34.950> that<00:06:35.130> down<00:06:35.190> to<00:06:35.580> there

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:35.999 
pull that down to there

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.359 
pull that down to there
and<00:06:36.319> select<00:06:37.319> this<00:06:37.559> line<00:06:37.860> which<00:06:38.039> is<00:06:38.069> the

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:38.369 
and select this line which is the

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:41.269 
and select this line which is the
thinner<00:06:38.669> one<00:06:38.909> the<00:06:39.119> one<00:06:39.269> in<00:06:39.299> behind<00:06:40.099> make<00:06:41.099> sure

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:41.279 
thinner one the one in behind make sure

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.329 
thinner one the one in behind make sure
it's<00:06:41.429> 25<00:06:42.029> and<00:06:42.419> now<00:06:42.989> it<00:06:43.169> gives<00:06:43.349> kind<00:06:43.709> of<00:06:43.860> a<00:06:43.949> clear

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:44.339 
it's 25 and now it gives kind of a clear

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.759 
it's 25 and now it gives kind of a clear
representation<00:06:44.879> of<00:06:45.599> what's<00:06:45.869> closer<00:06:46.199> what's

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:46.769 
representation of what's closer what's

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:49.100 
representation of what's closer what's
further<00:06:47.039> away<00:06:47.459> you<00:06:47.759> can<00:06:48.539> also<00:06:48.659> get<00:06:48.929> more

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
further away you can also get more

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.319 
further away you can also get more
specific<00:06:49.739> like<00:06:49.889> let's<00:06:50.159> say<00:06:50.369> this<00:06:50.669> window<00:06:51.149> is

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:51.329 
specific like let's say this window is

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:54.409 
specific like let's say this window is
existing<00:06:52.319> but<00:06:52.589> this<00:06:52.829> window<00:06:53.189> is<00:06:53.309> new<00:06:53.579> so<00:06:54.269> we'll

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
existing but this window is new so we'll

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.539 
existing but this window is new so we'll
hold<00:06:54.569> down<00:06:54.749> or<00:06:55.139> click<00:06:55.439> one<00:06:55.649> time<00:06:55.679> on<00:06:55.889> my<00:06:56.159> edit

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:56.549 
hold down or click one time on my edit

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.549 
hold down or click one time on my edit
layout<00:06:56.729> holding<00:06:57.509> down<00:06:57.659> shift<00:06:58.139> I'm<00:06:58.349> going<00:06:58.499> to

00:06:58.549 --> 00:06:58.559 
layout holding down shift I'm going to

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:00.919 
layout holding down shift I'm going to
drag<00:06:58.860> over<00:06:58.919> this<00:06:59.399> window<00:06:59.819> I'll<00:07:00.360> select<00:07:00.779> that

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:00.929 
drag over this window I'll select that

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:03.559 
drag over this window I'll select that
whole<00:07:01.199> window<00:07:01.559> open<00:07:01.949> it<00:07:02.069> up<00:07:02.219> and<00:07:02.459> maybe<00:07:03.299> make

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
whole window open it up and maybe make

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.189 
whole window open it up and maybe make
it<00:07:03.719> 35<00:07:04.110> and<00:07:05.089> I<00:07:06.089> don't<00:07:06.479> know<00:07:06.569> let's<00:07:06.869> make<00:07:07.169> it

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 
it 35 and I don't know let's make it

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.759 
it 35 and I don't know let's make it
like<00:07:07.469> a<00:07:07.499> blue<00:07:07.829> color<00:07:08.179> and<00:07:09.179> we<00:07:09.629> can<00:07:09.869> designate<00:07:10.169> a
