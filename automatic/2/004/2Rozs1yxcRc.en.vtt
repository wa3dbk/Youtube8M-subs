the<00:01:39.180> reason<00:01:39.450> why<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.750> braces<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.380> because

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the reason why I got braces is because

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
the reason why I got braces is because
um<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.220> dentist<00:01:41.939> said<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.509> teeth<00:01:42.750> were

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
um my dentist said my teeth were

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.310 
um my dentist said my teeth were
shifting<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.689> way<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
shifting so like I think this way I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.630 
shifting so like I think this way I
don't<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.979> weird<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.369> they're

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
don't know it's weird because they're

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
don't know it's weird because they're
straight<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.299> they're<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.570> shifting<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
straight but they're not shifting a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
straight but they're not shifting a
certain<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> bottom<00:01:51.000> ones<00:01:51.180> are

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
certain way and then the bottom ones are

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
certain way and then the bottom ones are
a<00:01:51.360> cricket<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.409> an<00:01:52.500> overbite

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
a cricket and then I have an overbite

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
a cricket and then I have an overbite
so<00:01:53.670> that's<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.210> they're<00:01:54.360> gonna<00:01:54.450> fix<00:01:54.810> um<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so that's what they're gonna fix um I
