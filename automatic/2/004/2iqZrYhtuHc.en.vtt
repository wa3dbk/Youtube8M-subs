00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
play against Maxie so often in I think

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.609 
play against Maxie so often in I think
that<00:00:21.670> it's<00:00:21.820> going<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.090> be<00:00:22.270> such<00:00:22.690> a<00:00:22.720> vital<00:00:23.140> part

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
that it's going to be such a vital part

of this format that you're going to need

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.790 
of this format that you're going to need
to<00:00:25.660> know<00:00:25.779> how<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.050> count<00:00:26.260> in<00:00:26.410> this<00:00:26.500> car<00:00:26.650> because

of this play and that will kind of
a lot<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.080> times<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.440> will<00:02:17.620> let<00:02:17.769> you<00:02:17.920> know<00:02:17.950> if

are pretty obvious in my opinion like if

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
are pretty obvious in my opinion like if
your<00:02:27.370> best-case<00:02:27.819> scenario<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.720> something

your best-case scenario is something

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.470 
your best-case scenario is something
like<00:02:29.709> la<00:02:29.950> Valse<00:02:30.190> where<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.730> put<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> quasar<00:02:31.420> on

best-case scenario is ending the game
generally<00:02:47.860> that's<00:02:47.980> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.430> weigh<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.610> lot

generally that's going to weigh a lot
with<00:02:49.060> me<00:02:49.180> because<00:02:49.510> then<00:02:49.750> card<00:02:50.019> advantage

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
with me because then card advantage

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.750 
with me because then card advantage
doesn't<00:02:50.590> matter<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:50.980> doesn't<00:02:51.040> matter<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.519> you

game<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.250> went<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.519> game<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.750> know<00:02:55.870> damage

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
game I went to game and you know damage

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.949 
game I went to game and you know damage
or<00:02:57.090> advantage<00:02:58.090> becomes<00:02:58.390> irrelevant<00:02:58.630> I

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
or advantage becomes irrelevant I

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.449 
or advantage becomes irrelevant I
especially<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.650> la<00:02:59.829> Valse<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.280> case

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
especially like la Valse in that case

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.100 
especially like la Valse in that case
because<00:03:00.760> they<00:03:00.940> can<00:03:01.120> negate<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.540> Gores<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
because they can negate the Gores and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.100 
because they can negate the Gores and
Gore's<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:02.950> obviously<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.310> counter<00:03:03.610> card

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
Gore's is obviously a counter card

Gore's is obviously a counter card
another<00:03:05.110> thing<00:03:05.379> you<00:03:05.530> need<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:06.040> way<00:03:06.220> in

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
another thing you need to the way in

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.690 
another thing you need to the way in
this<00:03:07.090> decision<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.079> risk<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.129> what

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
this decision is the risk you know what

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.789 
this decision is the risk you know what
is<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.940> likelihood<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.660> me<00:03:10.959> getting<00:03:11.349> this<00:03:11.590> if

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
is the likelihood of me getting this if

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.830 
is the likelihood of me getting this if
you<00:03:11.920> decide<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.610> know<00:03:12.760> you're<00:03:13.299> going<00:03:13.599> to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
you decide you know you're going to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.110 
you decide you know you're going to
attempt<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:15.190> know<00:03:15.280> big<00:03:15.549> push<00:03:15.819> where

again i think that the only time i'm

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.220 
again i think that the only time i'm
really<00:03:18.579> gonna<00:03:18.700> try<00:03:18.940> for<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.269> push<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.780> for<00:03:20.170> an

really gonna try for this push is for an
otk<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.650> need<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.040> weigh<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.280> risk<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:21.850> think

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
otk you need to weigh the risk and think

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.879 
otk you need to weigh the risk and think
what<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> likelihood<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.380> me<00:03:23.590> getting

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
what is the likelihood of me getting

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.550 
what is the likelihood of me getting
this<00:03:24.040> otk<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:25.030> know<00:03:25.180> ken<00:03:25.600> my<00:03:25.780> opponent<00:03:26.290> draw

this otk you know ken my opponent draw
an<00:03:26.889> effect<00:03:27.430> veiler<00:03:27.609> that<00:03:28.150> completely<00:03:28.540> stops

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
an effect veiler that completely stops

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.080 
an effect veiler that completely stops
my<00:03:29.109> otk<00:03:29.500> can<00:03:29.709> my<00:03:29.859> opponent<00:03:30.310> draw<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:30.730> course

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
my otk can my opponent draw of course

my otk can my opponent draw of course
you<00:03:31.660> know<00:03:31.780> if<00:03:32.019> you're<00:03:32.200> playing<00:03:32.440> against<00:03:32.769> a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
you know if you're playing against a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.900 
you know if you're playing against a
deck<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.160> hero<00:03:33.849> beat<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.660> they<00:03:34.810> use<00:03:35.019> maxi<00:03:35.590> uh

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
deck like hero beat and they use maxi uh

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.280 
deck like hero beat and they use maxi uh
there's<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.970> pretty<00:03:37.389> decent<00:03:37.870> chance<00:03:38.079> they

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
there's a pretty decent chance they

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.660 
there's a pretty decent chance they
might<00:03:38.470> not<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.920> words<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.579> to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
might not have words and you have to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.460 
might not have words and you have to
calculate<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.569> mean<00:03:40.959> they<00:03:41.109> might<00:03:41.349> be

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
calculate that I mean they might be

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.170 
calculate that I mean they might be
using<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.829> maxi<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.310> bluff<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.730> but<00:03:42.940> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
using the maxi to bluff you but that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.640 
using the maxi to bluff you but that
Bluff<00:03:43.480> doesn't<00:03:43.810> matter<00:03:43.989> if<00:03:44.230> they<00:03:44.349> don't<00:03:44.530> have

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
Bluff doesn't matter if they don't have

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.370 
Bluff doesn't matter if they don't have
Gore's<00:03:44.950> or<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.639> they<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.540> know<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:47.079> card
