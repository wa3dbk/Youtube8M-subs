here<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.730> one<00:01:50.730> of<00:01:50.760> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
here and that's kind of one of the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.820 
here and that's kind of one of the
people<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.810> built<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.230> this<00:01:52.470> school<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
people that have built up this school to

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.470 
people that have built up this school to
