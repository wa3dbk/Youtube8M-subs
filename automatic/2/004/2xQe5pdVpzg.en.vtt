00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.190
 at the current episode of pcgh in 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.599
 danger we test such a segway and yes 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.549
 Mr. Meier how dangerous she is 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.559
 Actually, that's actually relative 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.020
 dangerous because they're slower for 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.700
 father is it is intuitively controlled that 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.110
 means you automatically do the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.940
 Movements you run while also 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.690
 makes you go forward accelerated 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.520
 there you go back slowed me down 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.470
 turn left before the left turn 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.360
 right for the right turn because of that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 I personally think of it as relative 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.539
 not dangerous we are the cornerstones like 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.839
 a lot of ps and how many km h can do that 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:41.179
 thing per ps is just over-polled 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.039
 fast it is limited to 20 km / h like 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.929
 it looks like with the range so the 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.429
 range is theoretically 40 kilometers 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.129
 That depends on the weight of the driver 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.260
 on it on the texture and on 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.449
 the slopes and the route 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.699
 here and what is there now exactly installed 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.249
 a complete pc with how much cpu 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.989
 cores or how does the technology work? 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.449
 so it is calm it is a built-in 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.420
 ever two batteries as he on the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.770
 lithium ion base happen then is 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 I have a complete electronics 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.219
 now, of course, asking what exactly 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.640
 inside it works the direction 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.460
 that sensors are installed 100 times 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.990
 the second match what the driver 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.780
 just what makes the texture of the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.469
 Bodens makes and then the segway 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.240
 Stabilize or balance yourself 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.930
 then each system is double- installed in 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.909
 the segway 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.680
 that has simply with a the background 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.420
 system fails that it is equal to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.859
 next can be adopted similarly 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.030
 as with aircraft or at 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.030
 medical equipment is 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.149
 that as fast as possible 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.149
 raging tires unfortunately does not see 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.130
 I do not want that 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.650
 the first pcgh editor tries to be 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.650
 luck 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.420
 this high-tech costs around 8,000 euros 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.790
 fortbewegungsmittel 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.039
 who would like to try the segway 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.700
 The device can be used for touring as well 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.209
 borrow 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.860
 the price is about 40 euro who for 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.860
 this very special experience 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.629
 the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 gate 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.230
 completely harmless is the segway 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.450
 Of course not during the shooting 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.160
 You could always do that again 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.570
 bring border situations 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.570
 if you need it 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.360
 By the way, our copy will be 220 km h 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.880
 cordoned off 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.070
 although significantly more would go with it 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 a corresponding casemod one could 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.200
 So certainly more speed out 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.200
 pick up 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.280
 rather dangerous 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.280
 to go uphill 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.920
 The manufacturer also offers for the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.780
 Police wales on 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.850
 These drive a little faster than that 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.069
 serial version as well, there are special ones 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.120
 models for golf courses with one 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.120
 better tires
