00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello everyone, today I want with you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.069
 talk about sugar why am i 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.680
 I think that sugar consumption 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.190
 little people it's not only not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.429
 useful very even harmful in the diet 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.770
 My child is now 16 months, I have it 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.140
 practically i try to avoid 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.580
 high sugar intake 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.100
 for this you have to apply 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.109
 some effort to find products 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.230
 which is not much of this harmful 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.869
 sugar but I will not tell for a long time 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.450
 why is sugar harmful about it can 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.180
 get into any search engine and give you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.210
 many references to what for 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.910
 sugar is bad for kids and why is it necessary 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 avoid as much as possible 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 so I made the decision that what 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.550
 less sugar the better not at all 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 necessarily a child at that age 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.190
 buy candy sweets in general it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.410
 show that there is something to it to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 it is used to all, therefore, absolutely not 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 I buy no special for him 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 hara little stupid baby candy 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.460
 nobody's sweet cookies and just about such 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.119
 things he does not know my example 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 we buy such children's candy bars 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 some cookies but out to content 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.750
 sugar is very minimal she pay it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.909
 attention example here in america a little 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 content is indicated differently 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.920
 items as a product which you 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.650
 buy here there is such a table or 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.829
 suga is always indicated how much sugar 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.030
 contained in this product 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.950
 if you live in america do you 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 come here you can too 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.409
 pay attention to this i'm for example 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.479
 myself making a choice that sugar should 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.250
 should be 24 grams 5 maximum 10 well 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 for example just recently were in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.510
 a restaurant and qing asks a child 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.100
 bring juice and but also 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.780
 this is not thought of the brand of course why 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.530
 don't have a child order juice bring juice 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.190
 ordinary bank and I watch immediately move 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.380
 sahara sahara there was 47 grams of course 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.480
 I quickly brought this bottle back and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 no juice and speech can not be everything 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.780
 what is drinking movie is a large number 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.510
 I always drink water myself 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.460
 and also I cook some kind of compost and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.780
 because i have there and dried 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.590
 berries 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.010
 rosehip apples and these infusions I give him 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.410
 I give the boil I donâ€™t add sugar 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.970
 also what can drink this kefir montage 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.740
 savory but also some kind of childish than 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 sugar drinks i always try 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.150
 avoid and not add specially I 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.880
 against the use of juices small 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.190
 children firstly if purchased juice then 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.140
 there firstly high sugar content 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.970
 there preservatives this juice can be 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.730
 Naturally of course he is added 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.670
 various non- baby substances 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.860
 preservatives and if you do this juice 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.410
 home summit i have a juicer i 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.200
 I know what it is you need to get 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.540
 make juice because clean remains 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.150
 cake that remain these useful 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.489
 items that may well fall into 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.370
 organism to the child and here they remain not 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.080
 and you spend time bothering about it 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.890
 to make from child juice 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.190
 but in the end I make you a choice in that favor 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.360
 you just need to give fresh fruit 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.880
 whole baby 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.630
 expect a banana orange and thank god 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.390
 ronnie everyone likes to eat it with whole 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.569
 whole fruit and get all the healthy 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.060
 the cops therefore drinking juices for 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.520
 Kids, I think that it is not possible 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.260
 it is possible to avoid the next product 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.780
 which may contain sugar which 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.690
 consumes the example my child is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.390
 yogurt and i buy just plain 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.790
 natural yogurt without additives in it 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.940
 sugar content is usually 24 grams 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.800
 perfectly acceptable and accept the need 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.910
 if i want to add flavor add 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.970
 there fresh berries fruit or honey honey 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.739
 It is a useful sugar which may well be 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.780
 consume children if they are not 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.970
 low level valers to allergy no 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.310
 so I very often add honey to 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.920
 yogurt he likes these divorces which 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.799
 there are obtained or, if desired, you can 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.440
 add a little carbon paper soaring too 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.150
 some bright divorces get on 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 yogurt kids love it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.180
 example if brothers yogurt with fruit 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.720
 supplements there peach strawberry then in 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.290
 it already has a sugar content of 17 20 grams 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.950
 why buy a product with preservatives 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.660
 which is more sugar if you can 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.340
 buy absolutely natural yogurt and 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.860
 just diversify it for your 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.640
 baby's useful sugar belongs 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.290
 like honey fruit and dried fruit and 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.200
 a large number of arum is 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.960
 uses it really is not more expensive 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.780
 some sweets and cookies and much 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.580
 more useful therefore try to do too 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.160
 opt for some kind of natural 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.220
 products than buying any children 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.650
 sweets cookies and not the fact that if 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.590
 it is written that it is for children really 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.740
 it will be useful only where am I 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.020
 add sugar when I cook for the baby 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.060
 porridge really to a little and 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.370
 sweeten add quite literally 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.830
 half a teaspoon of sugar is brown 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.000
 turbine yes I already told about him 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.940
 what am I 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.810
 choice favor this sugar and this 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.760
 the only thing 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.530
 and adding sugar to my diet 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.660
 baby, I think that at his age 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.680
 it is possible to avoid consumption 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.320
 ice cream sugary sweets and that's all 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.110
 it will not be useful that I do not know 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.110
 now this taste is not at all scary 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.770
 time will come and he will eat ice cream 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.040
 will eat what he likes but 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.810
 Of course, under the clear guidance of me 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.410
 because i'm going to follow up further 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.870
 by the fact that he eats and how to enter another 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:05.340
 my meal advice for you 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:08.880
 and your children fruits and vegetables we always 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.130
 eat before meals before the main course 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.260
 In fact, it does not affect the appetite 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.870
 he eats up a child with pleasure 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.380
 a plate of berries before you eat 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.220
 example soup first so feed 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.230
 French people 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.750
 This is due to the fact that when products 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.940
 your stomach gets into the example of a berry and 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.919
 fruits they digest much faster 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.660
 literally in 10 15 minutes and for 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.140
 digesting heavy staple food 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.060
 it takes hours there and when you ate 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.550
 some main course and then for and 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.560
 give it to fruit then you 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.720
 fermentation process occurs in the body 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.450
 and these fruits are very long and wait 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.580
 their turn when their process comes 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:51.300
 digestion but it's like so complicated and 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.540
 figuratively and this fermentation process he 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.190
 not at all good for your stomach 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.220
 so for the french fruit it is go 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.000
 in they are dessert and we stick too 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.090
 such a rule 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.130
 so here are our little tips 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.130
 maybe someone will be useful to all for now
