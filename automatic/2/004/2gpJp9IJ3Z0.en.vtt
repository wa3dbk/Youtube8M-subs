of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> components<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.939> stays

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

exactly<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.930> same<00:01:19.140> bar<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> few<00:01:19.770> mishaps<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
exactly the same bar a few mishaps and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.320 
exactly the same bar a few mishaps and
returns<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:23.130> case<00:01:24.030> itself<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
returns the case itself if I just a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
returns the case itself if I just a
second<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.380> around<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> front<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
second then take around the front the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.420 
second then take around the front the
case<00:01:30.090> itself<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.759> cooler<00:01:32.759> master<00:01:33.240> cosmos<00:01:33.479> s

it<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.729> originally<00:01:36.299> released<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.229> 2008<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it was originally released in 2008 I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.460 
it was originally released in 2008 I
think<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:40.920> hefty<00:01:41.460> case

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
think it's a very hefty case

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.500 
think it's a very hefty case
as<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.800> can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.160> at<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.460> front<00:01:44.910> I<00:01:45.150> just

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
as you can see at the front I just

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.720 
as you can see at the front I just
closed<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.650> have<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:48.680> EK<00:01:49.680> spin<00:01:50.430> Bay

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
fan controller it's up then below that I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.220 
fan controller it's up then below that I
have<00:02:00.120> top<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> bottom<00:02:01.260> my<00:02:02.130> DVD<00:02:03.000> rewriter<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
have top to bottom my DVD rewriter and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.540 
have top to bottom my DVD rewriter and

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
also a blu-ray and HD DVD reader as well

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.750 
also a blu-ray and HD DVD reader as well
by<00:02:11.570> taking<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> background<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.350> side<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
by taking a background to the side and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.590 
by taking a background to the side and
you<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.260> side<00:02:16.830> panel<00:02:17.600> isn't

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
you can see that the side panel isn't

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.980 
you can see that the side panel isn't
actually<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.670> complete<00:02:20.670> side<00:02:21.240> panel<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.780> have

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
actually the complete side panel I have

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.790 
actually the complete side panel I have
taken<00:02:22.350> away<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:24.050> mesh<00:02:25.050> from<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.530> side<00:02:25.770> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
taken away the mesh from the side I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.580 
taken away the mesh from the side I
think<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.160> makes<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.870> looking<00:02:27.870> at<00:02:27.990> cleaner<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
think it makes it looking at cleaner I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.410 
think it makes it looking at cleaner I
do<00:02:29.190> plan<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.940> complete<00:02:32.090> clear<00:02:33.090> panel

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
do plan to have a complete clear panel

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
do plan to have a complete clear panel
replacement<00:02:34.320> for<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.890> at<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.220> point<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:37.080> if

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
replacement for this at some point so if

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.010 
replacement for this at some point so if
I<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:38.130> pop<00:02:38.400> side<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:41.510> take<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.959> look

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
I just pop side up and take a look

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.800 
I just pop side up and take a look
inside<00:02:43.850> now<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.910> first<00:02:45.120> thing<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.450> strikes

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
inside now the first thing that strikes

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.060 
inside now the first thing that strikes
you<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.800> amazing<00:02:47.280> green<00:02:48.000> coloring<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
you is the amazing green coloring of the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.100 
you is the amazing green coloring of the
cotton<00:02:50.070> which<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.910> emotional<00:02:51.390> bc<00:02:51.630> six

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
cotton which is the emotional bc six

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.740 
cotton which is the emotional bc six
color<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.980> UV<00:02:53.580> neon<00:02:53.940> green<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.250> i<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.640> just

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
color is UV neon green so if i can just

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.420 
color is UV neon green so if i can just
move<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.080> camera<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.470> bit<00:02:58.500> closer<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.250> them

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
move the camera a bit closer with them

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.780 
move the camera a bit closer with them
