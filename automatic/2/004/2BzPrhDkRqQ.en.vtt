00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.519
 hello I'm back with weigel today 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:19.680
 looks very thirsty for a short time 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.410
 do two times yes pusch 1 0 2 0 2 0 1 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.660
 so that we can lift and squat 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 The goals are clear 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.109
 For once I'm not going anymore 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 except that we just now when for 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.769
 later generations the growth phase 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 have paired down a bit and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.620
 We also did not say we want 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.710
 per week as often as possible 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 go training four times a week 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 have more because I have time for it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.469
 As I said goes longer training 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 Of course, the intensity of the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.450
 a few days up a bit 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.219
 quite logically we come to the same 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.920
 null 2 red 2 I wrote down that way 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 that's what the police would look like 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 Tuesday in my case where I am 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 say man just makes monday 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.680
 tuesday thursday friday so hold it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
 Hold on like that you hold that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.750
 weekend free via detours to cross 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.810
 avoid we have more attention 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.689
 directly on tuesday at the desk two brothers 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.520
 4 x 10 watt train 2 times 10 actually two 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.790
 basic exercises that we have in here 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.580
 then it goes a bit further with the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.369
 Both legs have to stretch 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.259
 we'll join you at bosch 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.850
 bit done then we go 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.650
 they were actually a push 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.090
 exercise that has me from concept yes but 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.930
 a bit better in the direction fit 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.409
 There we also do three pz cologne three times 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.630
 or barbell or what I totally 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.829
 like to do is an isolated 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.079
 history that I stabilize here 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.640
 must and then as far as I can I can 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.409
 even if in a long action at 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.470
 I always have a pain in the sz 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.670
 Forearm that is a bit bent over there 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.189
 I also come for the stretching and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.469
 Last but not least, we need it 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.900
 So then on friday so at 0 2 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.230
 0 1 of course back in there 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.970
 that will be the belly with 70 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.550
 again in the week small 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.500
 Muscle groups with 70 repetitions 72 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.630
 to be exact, if it is three times twelve 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
 are then so six times twelve are 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.240
 but 72 repetitions that briefly and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 scarcely 0 2 unfortunately I do not have today 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 enough air around the video yet 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 great to stay up you are 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.330
 Maybe you too happy that you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.520
 my waldschrate fused fraser 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.640
 do not have to endure two 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.820
 of course, make reference to the breast 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.890
 Bavarians were vice commander's belly 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.700
 Machine crunches depending on what your in 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.280
 we have seen your studio at push 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.350
 two thursday again that is not 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.270
 a lot different except that we just the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.640
 follow the clip the squat 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.870
 maybe we'll watch 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.400
 also that we do the exercises a bit 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.870
 this could vary on thursday 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.610
 little else do the monday 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.680
 that was so many very long 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.270
 different repetitions different 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.640
 we have some exercises with us 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.600
 increase weight naturally in all 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.690
 can 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.380
 that was 0 2 we'll see you at push 1 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.340
 again, it's good 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.340
 continue with that
