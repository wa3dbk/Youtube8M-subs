once I get the idea 100 home how do I
set<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:42.990> well<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.070> simple<00:01:44.159> there

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
set it up well it's really simple there

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
set it up well it's really simple there
are<00:01:44.670> two<00:01:44.820> ways<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.869> connect<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
are two ways that you can connect it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
are two ways that you can connect it
both<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.040> use<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> digital<00:01:47.970> output

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
both of which use the digital output

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.200 
both of which use the digital output
from<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> ID<00:01:48.720> 100<00:01:49.320> firstly<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.610> connect

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
from the ID 100 firstly you can connect

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
from the ID 100 firstly you can connect
it<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> an<00:01:51.600> external<00:01:51.960> digital<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> analog

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it to an external digital to analog

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.760 
it to an external digital to analog
converter<00:01:53.220> DAC<00:01:54.090> such<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.750> our<00:01:54.899> own<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.409> magic

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
converter DAC such as our own that magic

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.620 
converter DAC such as our own that magic
which<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.549> turn<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.790> connected<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
which will then in turn be connected to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.190 
which will then in turn be connected to
a<00:01:57.659> pair<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.009> speakers<00:01:59.009> through<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> amplifier

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
a pair of speakers through the amplifier

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.630 
a pair of speakers through the amplifier
otherwise<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.649> connect<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> directly<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
otherwise you can connect it directly to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.550 
otherwise you can connect it directly to
anything<00:02:03.149> else<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> digital<00:02:03.930> input<00:02:04.020> such

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
anything else with a digital input such

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.950 
anything else with a digital input such
as<00:02:04.770> an<00:02:05.100> AV<00:02:05.310> receiver<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:05.909> example<00:02:06.390> where<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
as an AV receiver for example where the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
as an AV receiver for example where the
digital<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> analog<00:02:07.829> conversion<00:02:08.160> will<00:02:08.399> take

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
digital to analog conversion will take

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.150 
digital to analog conversion will take
place<00:02:09.170> thanks<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.349> then<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.860> you'd<00:02:11.039> like

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
place thanks for that then if you'd like

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.979
