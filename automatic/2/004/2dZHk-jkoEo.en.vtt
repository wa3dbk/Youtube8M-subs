scoop that'll be a full scoop when you

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.869 
scoop that'll be a full scoop when you
unfold<00:00:57.109> it<00:00:57.499> and<00:00:57.649> then<00:00:58.249> you<00:00:58.339> can<00:00:58.429> go<00:00:58.519> ahead<00:00:58.760> and

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
unfold it and then you can go ahead and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:11.540 
unfold it and then you can go ahead and
cut<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.179> scoop

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.590 

next<00:01:12.550> we're<00:01:12.670> going<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.820> separate<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.360> scoop

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
next we're going to separate the scoop

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.090 
next we're going to separate the scoop
and<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.930> comb<00:01:14.140> by<00:01:14.320> cutting<00:01:14.590> them<00:01:14.710> both<00:01:14.920> in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
and the comb by cutting them both in

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.770 
and the comb by cutting them both in
half<00:01:15.310> there's<00:01:15.610> two<00:01:15.850> identical<00:01:16.300> pieces<00:01:16.450> of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
half there's two identical pieces of

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.890 
half there's two identical pieces of
each

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 

to<00:01:25.320> begin<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.650> gluing<00:01:25.920> process<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.550> your

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to begin the gluing process when your

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.190 
to begin the gluing process when your
hot<00:01:26.850> glue<00:01:27.000> gun<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> heated<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.110> go

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
hot glue gun is heated up you can go

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
hot glue gun is heated up you can go
ahead<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.440> apply<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> thin<00:01:28.920> line<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> glue<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
ahead and apply a thin line of glue to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.820 
ahead and apply a thin line of glue to
piece<00:01:30.120> together<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.510> scoop<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> cone<00:01:31.230> do

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
piece together the scoop and the cone do

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.990 
piece together the scoop and the cone do
this<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.100> both<00:01:32.250> pieces<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.730> make<00:01:32.850> sure

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
this for both pieces and make sure

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.130 
this for both pieces and make sure
you're<00:01:33.090> gluing<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> insides<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.080> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you're gluing with the insides of the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.969 
you're gluing with the insides of the
fabric<00:01:34.500> facing<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.870 

now<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.040> should<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.549> identical

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
now you should have two identical

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
now you should have two identical
icecream<00:01:45.360> cones<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.869> flip<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.500> over

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
icecream cones so flip one of them over

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
icecream cones so flip one of them over
and<00:01:47.039> line<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> pattern<00:01:48.000> facing

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and line it up with the pattern facing

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.330 
and line it up with the pattern facing
each<00:01:48.570> other<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> inside<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
each other on the inside and with the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.920 
each other on the inside and with the
glue<00:01:50.490> gun<00:01:50.520> starting<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> tip<00:01:51.539> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> cone

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
glue gun starting at the tip of the cone

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.080 
glue gun starting at the tip of the cone
I'm<00:01:52.140> applying<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.649> short<00:01:53.039> thin<00:01:53.280> line<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.820> close

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I'm applying a short thin line as close

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
I'm applying a short thin line as close
to<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> edge<00:01:54.539> as<00:01:54.570> possible<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.439> pressing<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to the edge as possible and pressing the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.010 
to the edge as possible and pressing the
two<00:01:56.250> pieces<00:01:56.460> together<00:01:56.700> basically<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
two pieces together basically this is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
two pieces together basically this is
just<00:01:58.049> sewing<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.619> lazy<00:01:58.890> people<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.640> make

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
just sewing for lazy people so just make

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.160 
just sewing for lazy people so just make
sure<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.939> keep<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.299> glue<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.630> close<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
sure to keep the glue as close to the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.160 
sure to keep the glue as close to the
outside<00:02:01.289> as<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> continue<00:02:03.810> gluing<00:02:03.990> at

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
outside as you can so continue gluing at
