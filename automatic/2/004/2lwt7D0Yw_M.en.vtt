00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.370
 the constitution of this team is 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:08.560
 based on what is the identity of 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.600

 entry an advantage a disadvantage 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.500
 competitive since we are new to the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.750
 block and there are no tools that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.420
 directions or conditions 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.199
 market block like 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.769
 then moves us the possibility of 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.710
 develop guidelines for orders 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.809

 this market so big and that for 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.110
 of course this supposes for us as 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.170
 generation of relay and for 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.250
 future generations the advantages that in 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.290
