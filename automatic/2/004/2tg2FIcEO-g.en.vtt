00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.880
 this clock has 32 and computing in the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:25.179
 three truth is the serial communication 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.830

 Let's now connect the equipment. 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.170
 The first thing I do is actually 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.110

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.579

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:15.810
 After attaching to the wall a cable

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.080
 the ideal is to check with the technician has the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.160
 company which dp class that has a 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.080
 ideal network is also to put the intercity 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.740
 the clock to no other machine 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.369
 conflict with it on the network is 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:53.550

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:28.349
 pedro henrique is a new 2008 0 and the end 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:37.410

 button to the location on the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.380

 Let's learn now how to call a non- coil. 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.200

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.890
 written paper raps on us baby 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.760
 flamenco everybody puts the government 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.760
 There was this cover, right? 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.960
 take the reel in that direction you are 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.500
 leaving emilio camacho places the support 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.150
 bovine and watch case 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.250

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 What are you going to do next? 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.910
 printer and load paper below the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:36.290
 goalkeeper of the male 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:38.210
 thus observed in paper and 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.790
 printer 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:57.170
 My advice is to give a makeover it 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:04:02.610
 until meniscus closes in a store 131 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:07.020

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.670
 coast to look green printer already 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 sets the cut type 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.459
 I advise setting the cut type 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.280
 total comprehension in green and then 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.430
 press the office button in total to 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.840
 state has done so affects once 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.390
 the red and green button normally 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.940
 until the next attempt to cut not 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:35.419
 It is near green paper setting in 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.849
 button to advance and cut I go forward 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.839
 Until the paper left class. 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.819
 after he left the person may 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:47.499
 take out the paper and you're done 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.289
 placed in the 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:54.249
 hp printer red button until back 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:57.939
 to the main menu is giving the message 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.949

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:04.209
 The way I put the small obina 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.039
 that is, the actor paper sensor or the 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:10.259
