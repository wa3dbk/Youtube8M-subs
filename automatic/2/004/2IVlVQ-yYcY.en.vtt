00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
opinion the 4222 formation has the best

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
opinion the 4222 formation has the best
possibility<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.899> build<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> hybrid<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.649> and

i'm<00:01:55.049> building<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.409> squad<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> weird<00:01:56.070> by

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
i'm building the squad in a weird by

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
i'm building the squad in a weird by
this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> how<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> built<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> was

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
this is how I built it when I was

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.090 
this is how I built it when I was
thinking<00:01:58.259> about<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> hybrid<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> make

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
thinking about a hybrid to make

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
thinking about a hybrid to make
considering<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.670> i<00:01:59.759> don't<00:02:00.000> use<00:02:00.180> foot<00:02:00.420> head

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
considering that i don't use foot head

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
considering that i don't use foot head
or<00:02:00.689> anything<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:01.110> i<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.320> these<00:02:01.469> hybrids

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
or anything when i make these hybrids

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
or anything when i make these hybrids
this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.210> thought<00:02:03.630> process<00:02:04.079> went

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
this is how that my thought process went

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.230 
this is how that my thought process went
essentially<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.579> we'll<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.880> moving<00:02:06.030> over

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520 
essentially so now we'll be moving over
