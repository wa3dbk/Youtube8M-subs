00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.390 

no<00:01:19.119> footballer<00:01:20.119> Barcelona<00:01:20.619> but<00:01:21.619> sorry's<00:01:22.220> it

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
no footballer Barcelona but sorry's it

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.480 
no footballer Barcelona but sorry's it
is<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.880> key<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.570> your<00:01:24.470> defenders<00:01:25.070> not<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
is the key to it your defenders not to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.969 
is the key to it your defenders not to
panic<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.240> easy<00:01:26.479> when<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.619> don't<00:01:27.770> have

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
panic it's easy when you don't have

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.770 
panic it's easy when you don't have
possession<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.640> ball<00:01:28.729> such<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> long<00:01:29.510> time

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
possession of the ball such a long time

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.850 
possession of the ball such a long time
later<00:01:30.080> my<00:01:30.290> panic

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.070 

I<00:01:32.890> think<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.030> balance<00:01:34.180> has<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.630> be<00:01:34.750> good

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
I think that the balance has to be good

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.440 
I think that the balance has to be good
within<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.830> team<00:01:36.070> because<00:01:36.880> we're<00:01:37.030> not<00:01:37.120> just<00:01:37.210> a

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
within the team because we're not just a

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.000 
within the team because we're not just a
defender<00:01:37.870> study<00:01:38.110> thing<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.620> know<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:38.860> the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
defender study thing you know it's the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.880 
defender study thing you know it's the
whole<00:01:39.190> thing<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.090> know<00:01:40.870> you<00:01:41.470> need<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.770> be

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
whole thing so you know you need to be

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.970 
whole thing so you know you need to be
able<00:01:42.010> to<00:01:42.570> close<00:01:43.570> out<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.960> spaces<00:01:44.410> as<00:01:44.560> much<00:01:44.800> as

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
able to close out the spaces as much as

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.130 
able to close out the spaces as much as
possible<00:01:45.190> early<00:01:45.730> if<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.120> threat<00:01:46.480> as<00:01:46.720> much<00:01:46.960> as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
possible early if the threat as much as

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.550 
possible early if the threat as much as
possible<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:47.940> ultimately<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.300> know<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
possible but ultimately you know the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:07.500 
possible but ultimately you know the
quality<00:01:51.010> of<00:02:05.160> after<00:02:06.160> after<00:02:06.580> sees<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.330> game

quality of after after sees in the game

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.170 
quality of after after sees in the game
where<00:02:07.960> Barcelona<00:02:08.470> has<00:02:08.619> created<00:02:09.190> 24<00:02:09.700> chances

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
where Barcelona has created 24 chances

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.870 
where Barcelona has created 24 chances
and<00:02:10.680> chosen<00:02:11.680> has<00:02:11.800> one<00:02:11.920> grade<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.340> one<00:02:12.370> shot<00:02:12.760> on

and chosen has one grade in one shot on

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.570 
and chosen has one grade in one shot on
target<00:02:13.060> which<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.630> before<00:02:14.250> beauty<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
target which is before beauty in the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.490 
target which is before beauty in the
poster<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.030> half<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.750> deserve<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.230> lose

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
poster on a half you deserve to lose

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.140 
poster on a half you deserve to lose
today<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:19.740> think<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.370> win<00:02:22.030> this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
today I think that when you win this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.170 
today I think that when you win this
cargo<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> win<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> game<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.880> think<00:02:25.090> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
cargo and you win a game I think you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.140 
cargo and you win a game I think you
deserve<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.750> win

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
deserve to win

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.339 
deserve to win
certainly<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:30.840> opposition

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
certainly the opposition

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.000 
certainly the opposition
few<00:02:33.680> more<00:02:33.859> times<00:02:34.189> and<00:02:34.400> targets<00:02:34.879> but<00:02:35.749> they<00:02:36.560> they

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
few more times and targets but they they

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.039 
few more times and targets but they they
had<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.519> this<00:02:37.639> effort<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.599> need<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.930> be

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
had all this effort so you need to be

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.989 
had all this effort so you need to be
clearly<00:02:39.379> helpful<00:02:39.859> to<00:02:39.980> think<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.280> charges<00:02:40.790> from

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:40.999 
clearly helpful to think of charges from

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.300 
clearly helpful to think of charges from
play<00:02:41.329> as<00:02:41.540> well<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.829> know<00:02:43.010> you're<00:02:43.189> gonna

next week
I'm<00:04:05.530> finding<00:04:05.860> yesterday<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.370> was<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.790> biggest

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
I'm finding yesterday it was the biggest

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.620 
I'm finding yesterday it was the biggest
test<00:04:07.680> actually<00:04:09.090> let<00:04:10.090> me<00:04:10.150> find<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
test actually let me find that the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.260 
test actually let me find that the
Africa<00:04:10.960> was<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.170> biggest<00:04:11.530> test<00:04:11.800> then<00:04:12.090> we<00:04:13.090> just

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
Africa was the biggest test then we just

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.180 
Africa was the biggest test then we just
seem<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.540> be<00:04:13.660> having<00:04:13.780> tests<00:04:14.440> all<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.590> time

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190

the<00:04:38.180> Borg<00:04:38.420> are<00:04:38.830> physically<00:04:39.830> working<00:04:41.140> two

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:52.450 
the Borg are physically working two
games<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:48.940> think<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.020> past<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:52.070> lot<00:04:52.400> of

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
games I think that in the past a lot of

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.440 
games I think that in the past a lot of
the<00:04:54.280> public<00:04:55.280> opinion<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.850> being<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.300> these

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
the public opinion is being that these

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.390 
the public opinion is being that these
boys<00:04:58.180> over<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.300> line<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.750> too<00:04:59.960> old<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:01.220> play

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
boys over the line and too old to play

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.580 
boys over the line and too old to play
two<00:05:01.550> games<00:05:06.190> on<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.220> pitch<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.550> you

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
two games on the pitch that you

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.060

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
regardless all eight games a short

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.000 
regardless all eight games a short
period<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.670> time<00:05:13.730> I<00:05:14.570> think<00:05:15.350> they<00:05:15.620> gave<00:05:15.770> the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
period of time I think they gave the

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
period of time I think they gave the
answer<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.520> beach<00:05:16.670> tonight

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030

we've<00:05:55.060> done<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.480> last<00:05:55.630> week

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:48.860 

now<00:06:41.970> we<00:06:42.120> prepared<00:06:42.510> because<00:06:46.970> so<00:06:47.970> the<00:06:48.450> team<00:06:48.690> was

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870

prepared<00:06:49.320> to<00:06:49.410> be<00:06:50.010> patient<00:06:50.330> defending<00:06:51.330> and<00:06:51.570> not

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
prepared to be patient defending and not

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.590 
prepared to be patient defending and not
get<00:06:52.500> frustrated<00:06:52.850> because<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:54.150> quality<00:06:54.360> of

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
get frustrated because the quality of

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.530 
get frustrated because the quality of
Barcelona<00:06:55.200> and<00:06:55.890> the<00:06:56.100> style<00:06:56.400> of<00:06:56.550> playing<00:06:56.820> is

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
Barcelona and the style of playing is

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.640 
Barcelona and the style of playing is
the<00:06:57.720> key<00:06:57.870> possession<00:06:58.230> and<00:06:59.570> so<00:07:00.570> you<00:07:01.170> know<00:07:01.350> I

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
the key possession and so you know I

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.920 
the key possession and so you know I
thought<00:07:02.400> you<00:07:02.790> know<00:07:02.820> we<00:07:03.060> look<00:07:03.210> very<00:07:03.240> organized

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
thought you know we look very organized

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.590 
thought you know we look very organized
and<00:07:04.200> and<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:05.160> boys<00:07:05.370> were<00:07:05.700> really<00:07:06.420> determined

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
and and the boys were really determined

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.770 
and and the boys were really determined
not<00:07:07.200> to<00:07:07.260> let<00:07:07.470> them<00:07:07.650> through<00:07:07.920> and<00:07:08.780> it's

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
not to let them through and it's

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.510 
not to let them through and it's
difficult<00:07:10.230> from<00:07:10.410> there<00:07:10.620> from<00:07:10.920> the<00:07:11.100> outside

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
difficult from there from the outside

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.910 
difficult from there from the outside
I'd<00:07:11.730> rather<00:07:11.880> be<00:07:12.060> on<00:07:12.810> the<00:07:12.990> inside<00:07:13.110> but<00:07:13.530> I

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
I'd rather be on the inside but I

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.710 
I'd rather be on the inside but I
thought<00:07:14.430> there<00:07:14.640> was<00:07:14.700> a<00:07:14.760> tremendous<00:07:15.030> effort<00:07:15.450> by

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
thought there was a tremendous effort by

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.200 
thought there was a tremendous effort by
the<00:07:15.870> group
