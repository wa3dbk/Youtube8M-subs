00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
good amount for running after the needle

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.039 
good amount for running after the needle
ran<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> still<00:01:35.759> picked<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.509> lot<00:01:36.900> of

a ton

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
a ton
after<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> needle<00:01:45.240> Roomba<00:01:46.140> works<00:01:46.350> really

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
after the needle Roomba works really

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399 
after the needle Roomba works really
good<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.729> let's<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.149> ahead<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:49.290> what

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
good but now let's go ahead and see what

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
good but now let's go ahead and see what
the<00:01:49.530> needle<00:01:49.860> picked<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.310> after<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.360> ran<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the needle picked up after it ran and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.200 
the needle picked up after it ran and
then<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> Roomba<00:01:52.680> ran<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> ran

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
then the Roomba ran and then it ran

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:08.120 
then the Roomba ran and then it ran
again<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.860> let's<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> got

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.430 

so<00:02:09.130> this<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.420> got<00:02:11.580> after<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:13.240> ran<00:02:13.780> then

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
so this is what it got after it ran then

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.820 
so this is what it got after it ran then
the<00:02:14.650> room<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.010> ran<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.520> then<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.390> ran<00:02:16.570> again<00:02:16.990> so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the room I ran and then it ran again so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.910 
the room I ran and then it ran again so
I'd<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.190> say<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.750> pretty<00:02:20.380> impressive

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
I'd have to say that's pretty impressive

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.770 
I'd have to say that's pretty impressive
I<00:02:21.370> mean<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.760> didn't<00:02:22.030> really<00:02:22.180> think<00:02:22.300> there<00:02:22.660> was

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
I mean I didn't really think there was

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.290 
I mean I didn't really think there was
much<00:02:22.990> left<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.470> anything<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.010> my<00:02:24.160> ground<00:02:24.490> my

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
much left of anything on my ground my

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.380 
much left of anything on my ground my
room<00:02:25.540> has<00:02:25.660> been<00:02:25.840> running<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> past<00:02:26.530> week<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
room has been running the past week and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.880 
room has been running the past week and
you<00:02:28.390> know<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.510> thought<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.080> got<00:02:29.260> pretty<00:02:29.650> much

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
you know I thought if it got pretty much

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.570 
you know I thought if it got pretty much
everything<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:31.570> was<00:02:31.690> down<00:02:31.900> there<00:02:32.580> but

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
everything that was down there but

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.630 
everything that was down there but
obviously<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:35.500> nito's<00:02:35.920> picking<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.430> lot

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
obviously this nito's picking up a lot

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.430 
obviously this nito's picking up a lot
more<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.420> seems<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:37.810> picking<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.350> little

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
more and it seems we picking up a little

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.410 
more and it seems we picking up a little
bit<00:02:38.650> more<00:02:38.770> fuzz

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
bit more fuzz

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.050 
bit more fuzz
whereas<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.080> didn't<00:02:42.010> get<00:02:42.340> quite<00:02:42.610> as<00:02:42.760> much<00:02:42.790> of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
whereas this didn't get quite as much of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.000 
whereas this didn't get quite as much of
the<00:02:43.150> fuzz<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.959> ran<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.530> then<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.770> ran

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
the fuzz this ran and then that ran

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.520 
the fuzz this ran and then that ran
again<00:02:45.280> after<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.930> looks<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.260> nito's

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
again after so it looks like the nito's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.840 
again after so it looks like the nito's
vacuum<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.010> probably<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.310> little<00:02:48.430> stronger

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
vacuum is probably a little stronger

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.060 
vacuum is probably a little stronger
picking<00:02:49.540> up<00:02:49.660> smaller<00:02:50.020> stuff<00:02:50.470> which<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.739> pretty

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
picking up smaller stuff which is pretty

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.240 
picking up smaller stuff which is pretty
cool<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:52.090> does<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.360> really<00:02:52.390> great<00:02:52.930> job<00:02:53.250> I'm

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
cool it does a really great job I'm

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.030 
cool it does a really great job I'm
gonna<00:02:54.489> have<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.820> say<00:02:55.060> when<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.360> compare<00:02:55.840> them

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
gonna have to say when you compare them

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.630 
gonna have to say when you compare them
the<00:02:57.040> needle<00:02:57.400> probably<00:02:57.850> does<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> better<00:02:58.420> job<00:02:59.640> it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the needle probably does a better job it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.240 
the needle probably does a better job it
picked<00:03:00.940> up<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.330> after<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.170> ran<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.709> after

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
picked up that after it ran and after

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.770 
picked up that after it ran and after
this<00:03:03.370> room<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.760> ran<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.180> I'd<00:03:04.270> have<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> say<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
this room I ran so I'd have to say the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.110 
this room I ran so I'd have to say the
needle<00:03:05.110> does<00:03:05.350> do<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> better<00:03:05.799> job<00:03:05.890> than<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.459> 500

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
needle does do a better job than my 500

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.020 
needle does do a better job than my 500
series<00:03:07.330> Roomba<00:03:07.950> but<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> 500<00:03:09.850> series

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
probably would be a little better and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.710 
probably would be a little better and
able<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.790> match<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.299> needle<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.690> little

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
able to match this needle a little

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.570 
able to match this needle a little
better

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580

what<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.610> can<00:03:18.790> say<00:03:18.970> about<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.360> Roombas<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.989> even

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
what I can say about the Roombas is even

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.289 
what I can say about the Roombas is even
my<00:03:20.950> room<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.340> red<00:03:21.489> which<00:03:21.670> I've<00:03:21.790> had<00:03:21.970> for<00:03:22.030> like

my room of red which I've had for like
10<00:03:22.600> years<00:03:22.630> still<00:03:23.260> works<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.430> needles<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:25.090> don't

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
10 years still works the needles I don't

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.060 
10 years still works the needles I don't
know<00:03:25.510> how<00:03:25.660> long<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:26.019> gonna<00:03:26.110> last<00:03:26.230> if<00:03:26.920> it

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
know how long it's gonna last if it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.800 
know how long it's gonna last if it
lasts<00:03:27.459> for<00:03:27.640> years<00:03:27.670> needing<00:03:28.299> nothing<00:03:28.600> more

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
lasts for years needing nothing more

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.930 
lasts for years needing nothing more
than<00:03:28.959> batteries<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.590> brushes<00:03:29.980> that'd<00:03:30.790> be

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
than batteries and brushes that'd be

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.500 
than batteries and brushes that'd be
awesome

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
awesome

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.600 
awesome
just<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.440> see<00:03:32.620> how<00:03:32.799> long<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:33.130> lasts<00:03:33.340> but

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
just have to see how long it lasts but

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.810 
just have to see how long it lasts but
as<00:03:34.330> for<00:03:34.570> how<00:03:34.690> much<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:34.900> picks<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.700> think<00:03:36.700> it's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
as for how much it picks up I think it's

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.240 
as for how much it picks up I think it's
the<00:03:36.940> definite<00:03:37.299> winner<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.470> anyways<00:03:38.739> guys<00:03:38.769> that

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
the definite winner so anyways guys that

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.070 
the definite winner so anyways guys that

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
was a little review again the neato vs.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.780 
was a little review again the neato vs.
the<00:03:41.170> Roomba<00:03:41.500> how<00:03:41.980> many<00:03:42.160> questions<00:03:42.610> let<00:03:42.760> me

the Roomba how many questions let me

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.170 
the Roomba how many questions let me
know

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
know

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.900
