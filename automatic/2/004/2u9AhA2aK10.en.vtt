00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 i'll show you her beauty today if 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.260
 to fold bags for example for a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 last appell calendar or just like that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:32.610
 for small gifts and for that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:36.030
 We have a wrapping paper size din a4 only 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 for the decor to quantity about 1 in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:54.110
 centimeters from the long side once 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 a centimeter from the short side 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.399
 [Music] 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.220
 [Music] 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.690
 a bit of glue and then stayed the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.379
 bag together 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.379
 [Music] 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.680
 and that will be the upper side of dull 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 bag and show down here now 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.350
 the ground for it would be about as free 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.479
 centimeter first still somehow sounds 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.890
 [Music] 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.320
 if the corners and variety 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.930
 [Music] 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.570
 what are we doing on the other side? 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.700
 just like that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.700
 [Music] 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:06.140
 so you can do it if the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:08.929
 set basin after them and you have 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.890
 now twice a time is not 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.920
 more up 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.480
 really colorful and the other side then 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.480
 also click up again 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.920
 and now folded back about like that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.310
 that's half an inch to ten 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 centimeter looks over the edge out 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.250
 if I could turn that around right away 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.260
 to go better 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.090
 [Music] 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.610
 that makes them both again 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.180
 Each side reveals the back 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.180
 up 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.460
 with the theme on it and then it is 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.649
 the floor already finished 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.649
 [Music] 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.599
 Print the whole thing through 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.769
 before you can open the bag 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.290
 I do not get it yet as accurate you 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.840
 time it looks like but find the same 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.780
 I am the official so and for the lamps 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.310
 I just have advent calendars 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.799
 out of wrapping paper a fir-tree 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.780
 cut out and again a circle 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:21.250
 glued to the newspaper and then 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.250
 all that's missing now is the ribbons 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:31.030
 that's the hall of england now 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.290
 contract 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:42.890
 you pull this once from the front 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:50.820
 behind and from there silva 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:56.280
 [Music] 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.280
 Now I do the bags with drugs 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.189
 24 stages then you have a nice 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.390
 homemade advent calendar or times 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:14.920
 for gift for christmas birthday 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.230
 once great 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.350
 I wish you much fun 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.350
