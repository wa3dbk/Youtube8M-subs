this<00:00:15.960> video<00:00:16.170> we're<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.800> looking<00:00:17.039> at

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
this video we're going to be looking at

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040 
this video we're going to be looking at
the<00:00:17.400> best<00:00:17.640> way<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> get<00:00:18.300> your<00:00:18.420> auger<00:00:18.779> kills

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

the best way to get your auger kills
ogres<00:00:19.800> are<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> rarest<00:00:20.580> units<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ogres are one of the rarest units in the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.720 
ogres are one of the rarest units in the
game<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.630> getting<00:00:21.900> 250<00:00:22.800> ogre<00:00:23.160> kills<00:00:23.369> might

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
game so getting 250 ogre kills might

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
game so getting 250 ogre kills might
seem<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> lot<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.500> isn't<00:00:25.740> if

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
seem like a lot but it really isn't if

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
seem like a lot but it really isn't if
you<00:00:26.130> put<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> bit<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> time<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:27.000> farming<00:00:27.449> them

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you put a bit of time into farming them

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
you put a bit of time into farming them
if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.349> enjoy<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.740> video<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> helps

you out then remember to hit that like
button<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.289> me<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
button for me so it's actually really

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.000

really<00:00:33.420> simple<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.380> probably<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
really simple you can probably see the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.590 
really simple you can probably see the
route<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.670> running<00:00:35.910> already<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
route that I'm running already in the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
route that I'm running already in the
video<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.170> basically<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.219> into

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
video but basically you want to get into

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
video but basically you want to get into
the<00:00:38.579> shrine<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.180> Oryx<00:00:39.570> mission<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.079> moon

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the shrine of Oryx mission on the moon

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.470 
the shrine of Oryx mission on the moon
and<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.190> want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> make<00:00:41.640> sure<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> level

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and you want to make sure that the level

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
and you want to make sure that the level
you<00:00:42.600> play<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> first<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> think

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you play is on the first one I think

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
you play is on the first one I think
it's<00:00:44.700> level<00:00:45.000> nine<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> play<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's level nine because if you play it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
it's level nine because if you play it
with<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> heroic<00:00:47.340> modifier<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.390> ogre

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
with the heroic modifier on the ogre

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
with the heroic modifier on the ogre
kills<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.469> count<00:00:49.829> towards<00:00:50.309> your

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

shooting the odor quit your back up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840 
shooting the odor quit your back up
against<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:08.100> wall<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
against this little wall so that you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
against this little wall so that you
don't<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.330> shot<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.990> by<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.260> drags

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
don't get shot in the back by the drags

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
don't get shot in the back by the drags
and<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> acolyte<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.479> any<00:01:12.659> weapon

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and the acolyte you can use any weapon

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
and the acolyte you can use any weapon
you<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> snipe<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.100> work<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> best

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you want but a snipe will work the best

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
you want but a snipe will work the best
and<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.060> pretty<00:01:15.210> sure<00:01:15.299> most<00:01:15.630> snipers<00:01:16.229> will

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and I'm pretty sure most snipers will

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
and I'm pretty sure most snipers will
kill<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.310> critical<00:01:17.820> shots

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
kill the over with two critical shots

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
kill the over with two critical shots
and<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.780> pretty<00:01:19.049> easy<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> create<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:20.040> ogre

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and it's pretty easy to create an ogre

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.399 
and it's pretty easy to create an ogre
once<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.270> killed<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> ogre<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> simply

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
once you have killed the ogre you simply

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
once you have killed the ogre you simply
