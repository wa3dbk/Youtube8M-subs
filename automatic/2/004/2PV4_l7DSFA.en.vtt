 baillargues 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.550
 alone 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.419
 among them 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.169
 filming in london 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.720
 young dad 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.979

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.050
 who pays 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.590
 I would like to have lr it's a point 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.880
 I do not understand what you are saying 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.510
 rate 10 why continue or not 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 a why 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.530
 on Monday 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.160
 braaten 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 it is this province 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.430
 it's called the disturbing do the one who falls in is not near by 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.380
 go out 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 it would be too good if it happened with the foxes it would be nice if 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.930
 life who kills more food than he needs for his food being 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 a criminal who must be severely punished 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.320
 I thought well I think we could not make the water run and the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 break the markets are still for you'll see 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.900
 finished the beasts but the last hour if that's all that happens on the contrary 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.580
 and why not what is the justifying report of a market that knows 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.580
 well 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.729
 and not at home and no new failure preview 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.880
 he's on the back of a chablon exactly like you said that m I 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.350
 been a month 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.320
 No but 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 while the real value 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.039
 this wager 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.420
 you read them well I fucked the crisis 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.119
 perhaps 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.349
 failure 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.589
 it happens that's what we wanted 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.359
 abbas that's all 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.359
 add salt and pepper 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 hortense 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.069

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 of gold - art 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.039
 he also wanted to bring down 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.179
 a second mission why 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.179
 it's time to pay the bill 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.309
 he will be able to lean 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:06.869
 it may not be 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:11.559
 true I think it's rather the beginning of the return phase and the 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.969
 justice that is still in the future 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.030
 to see below 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.119
 here 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.599
 2 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.939
 but since 2009 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.939
 good 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.329
 montebourg 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.490
 dr 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.490
 more than 2000 deaths tomorrow 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.769
 he also did not want to hurt 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.629
 bush 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.809
 in brussels brave 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.819
 good 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.289
 but devoid of interest a quest for a bmw 2 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:08.599
 delegate of the general tax society dgi bobigny m that the 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.190
 better 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.190
 the man is that said 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.489

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.309
 ap 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.780
 if you did not have it if he was there he would have continued to eat every year 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.260
 at the other end of the story 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.680
 especially helped by topiaries 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.069
 at first I did not believe it 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.389
 but now I realize that we often need a smaller than ourselves 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.569
 why not it's true that our girlfriend is often good advice the mayor 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.259
 tomic news 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.259
 why not all Bretons are stupid 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.689
 or 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.689
 the real madrid will see marne again 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.319
