00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello everyone this is your own recipe 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.800
 trivial, but in my opinion it can 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 be inspired to make sweets 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 when in a hurry 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.960
 I have here the puff pastry is my 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 a vegan puff pastry does not contain 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.769
 derivatives of bad origins like fat there is 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.499
 a vegetable margarine 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.480
 ok i also here this is not one 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:37.050
 stable mold for making tartlets 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.950
 but to the bordeaux part we say so 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.970
 a bit with a cute hem and I liked it and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.270
 or even here a pastry cutter can also be 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.030
 let's say the pasta appears with with a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.850
 glass of course what I do I go to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.850
 create t here's skates 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.930
 so so 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:21.140
 after creating all the molds I believe 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.759
 some chocolate sauce like anyway 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.679
 you can use whatever you prefer 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.890
 this is the access to chocolate 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.619
 I made it at home 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.329
 ok of cream moment in the middle 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.759
 here here this has been in 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.560
 fridge and so it is pretty firm but in 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:45.890
 reality of his is a cream that I make 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:50.060
 I think I do cisco the center of one of the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.380
 disks and then I go over with the other one like that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.380
 the close 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.030
 here it is 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.470
 the sixth 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.340
 another dessert that you can do with the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.500
 browse and this we dust the well 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.130
 worktop with sugar of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:30.270
 plenty of cane sugar 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:32.959
 here we put the pastry over 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.959
 in this way 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.580
 newlyweds 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.490
 we put with brown sugar also 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.490
 under 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.819
 with an antenna of those to make the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.860
 pasta cut in half 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:27.120
 in this way and then make gods 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.120
 rectangles just simply
