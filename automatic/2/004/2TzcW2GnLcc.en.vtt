00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to all of you guys this first video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.420
 my name is jericho 27 I deal with it 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.730
 gameplay applicators even if not 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.309
 quite huge in a moment 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 I will start the group of pokemon platinum 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.670
 it is precisely today I will make a short video 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.949
 tutorial 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.400
 as precisely being able to download the Roma 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 of pokemon platinum is the no gba emulator 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.770
 I state that to play then the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.040
 nantes endemol came out anyway of 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.510
 emulator section are many 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.239
 however for those who have a desktop computer 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 quite powerful advice of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 take the and it's boom for nintendo 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.559
 ds but for those who do not have a computer 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.899
 not very powerful but with the raiser of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.030
 I strongly recommend the well-known Bible 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.149
 because I'm leaving a wagon fairy tale 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.280
 with that site is de mutor john tanto 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 those known 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 that's how far we all go 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 also existing for ps2 ps3 virtual boy 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.729
 has had we go on the game section 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.820
 boy or by living of the same thing 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 turning on we could desmo me mobility 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.210

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 since it comes in to download anyway if 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.689

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.000
 let's go to this link and the wall of the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.700
 jar and then precisely the File menu 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.100
 quite easy to 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.100
 to use 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.390

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:16.530
 minimum description here there is a load today 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.680
 I can put very little thing of 30 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.680
 seconds 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.959
