work<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:07.280> thought<00:01:08.180> particular<00:01:08.630> their<00:01:08.750> defense

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
work I thought particular their defense

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.320 
work I thought particular their defense
was<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.860> know<00:01:09.920> we<00:01:10.130> went<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.400> tempo<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:11.180> is

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
was you know we went up tempo this is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.500 
was you know we went up tempo this is
wrong<00:01:11.540> you<00:01:11.960> know<00:01:12.049> they<00:01:13.060> started<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.210> fatigue

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
wrong you know they started to a fatigue

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.240 
wrong you know they started to a fatigue
and<00:01:14.780> did<00:01:14.960> slow<00:01:15.229> down<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:15.920> think<00:01:15.979> they

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
and did slow down and I think they

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.950 
and did slow down and I think they
thought<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.700> longer<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.270> game<00:01:17.450> went<00:01:17.750> maybe

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
thought the longer the game went maybe

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.510 
thought the longer the game went maybe
they<00:01:18.409> wanted<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.710> either<00:01:18.860> win<00:01:19.070> or<00:01:19.130> lose<00:01:19.430> it
