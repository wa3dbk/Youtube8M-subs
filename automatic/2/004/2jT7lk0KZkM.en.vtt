what I think is the best one and how in

what I think is the best one and how in
actuality<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:30.539> you're<00:00:30.929> really<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> tight

actuality if you're really on a tight
budget<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.279> only<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.030> thing<00:00:33.890> what's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
budget and only can get one thing what's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.459 
budget and only can get one thing what's
the<00:00:34.980> best<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> buy<00:00:35.510> cetera<00:00:36.510> et<00:00:36.540> cetera<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.079> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the best to buy cetera et cetera so I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.970 
the best to buy cetera et cetera so I
thought<00:00:38.100> I'd<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.520> through<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
thought I'd just go through them and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
thought I'd just go through them and
show<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.110> okay<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.320> course

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
show you what they are okay of course

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.340 
show you what they are okay of course
there<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.460> regular<00:00:45.350> Signature

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there is the regular Signature

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
there is the regular Signature
Collection<00:00:46.379> both<00:00:46.950> map<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.850> travel<00:00:48.300> sizes

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
Collection both map these travel sizes

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
Collection both map these travel sizes
they're<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.930> hard<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> find<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.649> because

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
they're kind of hard to find now because

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.040 
they're kind of hard to find now because
most<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.270> being<00:00:51.420> phased<00:00:51.809> out

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
most of them are just being phased out

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650 
most of them are just being phased out
they<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> full<00:00:53.399> size<00:00:53.640> however<00:00:54.539> they

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
they do have a full size however they

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.830 
they do have a full size however they
are<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.230> flux<00:00:55.680> cents<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.309> every<00:00:56.789> pregnant<00:00:57.600> has

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
are in flux cents not every pregnant has

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
are in flux cents not every pregnant has
a<00:00:57.870> matching<00:00:58.140> mobile<00:00:58.530> app<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.250> -<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.460> really

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a matching mobile app but - not really

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.049 
a matching mobile app but - not really
peas<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.239> people<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.850> also

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
peas some people but you can also

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.060 
peas some people but you can also
remember<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.600> regular<00:01:04.019> body<00:01:04.290> washes<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
remember that regular body washes and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.120 
remember that regular body washes and
shower<00:01:05.309> gels<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:06.350> reformulated<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.040> able

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
shower gels are reformulated to be able

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.690 
shower gels are reformulated to be able
to<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.700> used<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.420> bubble<00:01:09.780> bath<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.369> fry

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to be used as a bubble bath so don't fry

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
to be used as a bubble bath so don't fry
and<00:01:11.970> I'll<00:01:12.060> explain<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> difference<00:01:12.960> between

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and I'll explain the difference between

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
and I'll explain the difference between
the<00:01:13.560> two<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.610> isn't<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the two because there really isn't a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
the two because there really isn't a
huge<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.049> opinion<00:01:17.330> okay<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.820> when<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
huge one in my opinion okay so when you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.630 
huge one in my opinion okay so when you
use<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.659> OS<00:01:22.140> compared<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> shower<00:01:23.280> gel

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
use this OS compared to the shower gel

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.350 
use this OS compared to the shower gel
you'll<00:01:24.240> notice<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.750> things<00:01:25.850> one<00:01:26.850> obviously

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you'll notice two things one obviously

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
you'll notice two things one obviously
this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.380> thicker<00:01:28.640> little<00:01:29.640> cloudier

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
this is a little thicker little cloudier

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
this is a little thicker little cloudier
and<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.140> does<00:01:31.350> make<00:01:32.189> thicker<00:01:32.670> bubbles<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and it does make thicker bubbles the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
and it does make thicker bubbles the
bubbles<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.890> tend<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.130> last<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.729> longer

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
bubbles do tend to last a little longer

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
bubbles do tend to last a little longer
than<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> shower<00:01:36.630> gel<00:01:36.990> however<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
than the shower gel however I think that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
than the shower gel however I think that
for<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> shower<00:01:40.650> gel<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> signature<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
for a shower gel that a signature of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.530 
for a shower gel that a signature of
junior<00:01:42.750> gel<00:01:42.780> makes<00:01:43.290> okay<00:01:43.920> wet<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:45.149> not

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
junior gel makes okay wet I'm not

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
junior gel makes okay wet I'm not

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
problems and really I think the problem

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
well I mean here it it doesn't matter

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.880

but<00:02:20.280> what<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.209> saying<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.410> reformulation

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
but what I'm saying is the reformulation

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.339 
but what I'm saying is the reformulation
they<00:02:23.370> did<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.150> ago<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:25.170> made<00:02:25.319> a

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
they did it here to ago really made a

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.330 
they did it here to ago really made a
difference<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.450> sometimes<00:02:27.950> mix<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.130> with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
difference and I sometimes mix this with

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.979 
difference and I sometimes mix this with
another<00:02:29.550> bubble<00:02:29.760> bath<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.630> creates
