comparison on the boot of times between

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.910 
comparison on the boot of times between
my<00:00:14.880> imac<00:00:16.190> 27-inch<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.090> back<00:00:18.480> in

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
my imac 27-inch this is back in

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.210 
my imac 27-inch this is back in
2009-2010<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:21.260> against<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.439> macbook<00:00:23.039> air

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
2009-2010 and against my macbook air

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.939 
2009-2010 and against my macbook air
which<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.640> made<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.119> mid-2012<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.500> release<00:00:25.769> in

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
which was made in mid-2012 or release in

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.779 
which was made in mid-2012 or release in
mid-2012<00:00:27.320> first<00:00:28.320> boot<00:00:28.890> tests<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.460> i<00:00:29.490> did<00:00:29.670> with

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
mid-2012 first boot tests and i did with

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.530 
mid-2012 first boot tests and i did with
my<00:00:29.849> macbook<00:00:30.330> gear<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:31.910> for<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.149> reason

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
my macbook gear was for some reason

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.880 
my macbook gear was for some reason
slower<00:00:33.989> than<00:00:34.230> usual<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:36.320> today<00:00:37.320> i<00:00:37.350> will<00:00:37.860> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
slower than usual so today i will be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.490 
slower than usual so today i will be
showing<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.370> guys<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.579> true<00:00:39.180> speed<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.809> both<00:00:40.320> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
showing you guys a true speed of both of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
showing you guys a true speed of both of
these<00:00:40.559> computers<00:00:41.010> they're<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.910> much

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
these computers they're actually much

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.319 
these computers they're actually much
faster<00:00:42.410> than<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.469> expected<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.370> let's<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
faster than I expected so let's do a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
faster than I expected so let's do a
quick<00:00:45.750> boot<00:00:46.110> time<00:00:46.500> test<00:00:47.899> alright<00:00:48.899> alright<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
quick boot time test alright alright so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.639 
quick boot time test alright alright so
let's<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:55.430> I'm<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.579> sit<00:00:56.760> down<00:00:56.789> here

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
let's do this I'm gonna sit down here

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:11.810 
let's do this I'm gonna sit down here
hold<00:00:58.649> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.000 

so<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:13.180> did<00:01:13.660> future<00:01:14.050> prove<00:01:14.230> this<00:01:14.380> computer<00:01:14.860> for

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
so I did future prove this computer for

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.880 
so I did future prove this computer for
three<00:01:15.820> or<00:01:15.940> four<00:01:16.000> years<00:01:16.270> ago<00:01:16.570> well<00:01:17.560> actually<00:01:17.680> I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
three or four years ago well actually I

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.940 
three or four years ago well actually I
think<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.100> been<00:01:18.370> 24<00:01:18.610> years<00:01:18.670> already<00:01:19.530> well<00:01:20.530> it

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
think it's been 24 years already well it

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.900 
think it's been 24 years already well it
has<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.610> quad<00:01:21.970> core<00:01:22.240> core<00:01:23.230> i7<00:01:23.890> 2.8<00:01:24.640> gigahertz

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
has a quad core core i7 2.8 gigahertz

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.440 
has a quad core core i7 2.8 gigahertz
chip<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.160> 12<00:01:27.160> gigabytes<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.820> RAM<00:01:28.120> which<00:01:28.330> I

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
chip and 12 gigabytes of RAM which I

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.710 
chip and 12 gigabytes of RAM which I
added<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:28.990> later<00:01:29.020> from<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:30.280> 4<00:01:30.760> gigabytes<00:01:31.600> i

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
added on later from a 4 gigabytes i

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.920 
added on later from a 4 gigabytes i
believe<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.860> does<00:01:33.130> run<00:01:33.580> programs<00:01:34.570> pretty

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
believe so it does run programs pretty

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.750 
believe so it does run programs pretty
nicely<00:01:36.420> there's<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.750> apple<00:01:38.050> logo<00:01:38.760> shouldn't

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
nicely there's the apple logo shouldn't

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.990 
nicely there's the apple logo shouldn't
take<00:01:39.790> too<00:01:39.910> long<00:01:40.150> from<00:01:40.630> here<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:44.580> pit<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.610> believe

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
take too long from here I pit I believe

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
take too long from here I pit I believe
this<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.480> much<00:01:47.350> more<00:01:47.460> improvement<00:01:48.460> from<00:01:48.700> my

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this is much more improvement from my

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.950 
this is much more improvement from my
own<00:01:50.710> before<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.190> clean<00:01:51.610> installed<00:01:52.510> this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
own before I clean installed this

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.090 
own before I clean installed this
computer<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.490> reformatted<00:01:55.150> everything<00:01:55.480> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.330 

let's<00:02:03.100> see<00:02:03.430> come<00:02:03.970> on

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.430 

alright<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.840> was<00:02:11.019> around<00:02:11.319> 2<00:02:12.160> 15<00:02:12.310> I'll<00:02:13.440> make

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
alright so it was around 2 15 I'll make

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.559 
alright so it was around 2 15 I'll make
sure<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:15.010> got<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> time<00:02:15.489> right<00:02:15.670> there<00:02:15.700> now

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
sure that I got the time right there now

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.070 
sure that I got the time right there now
let's<00:02:16.750> move<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.080> my<00:02:17.410> macbook<00:02:17.890> air<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.569> let

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
let's move on to my macbook air so let

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.339 
let's move on to my macbook air so let
me<00:02:20.230> go<00:02:20.440> ahead<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.680> click<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:25.349> there

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
me go ahead and click this and there

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:34.740 
me go ahead and click this and there
goes<00:02:26.379> my<00:02:26.950> macbook<00:02:27.430> air<00:02:32.069> let's<00:02:33.069> see<00:02:33.540> there's<00:02:34.540> a

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
goes my macbook air let's see there's a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.430 
goes my macbook air let's see there's a
little<00:02:35.110> wheel<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.269> go<00:02:37.330> about<00:02:37.930> 14

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
little wheel and there you go about 14

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.000 
little wheel and there you go about 14
seconds<00:02:39.299> very<00:02:40.299> very<00:02:40.660> different<00:02:41.019> obviously

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
seconds very very different obviously

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.839 
seconds very very different obviously
but<00:02:42.880> i<00:02:43.180> do<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:44.130> noticed<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.220> there<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.819> a

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
but i do have noticed that there is a

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.500 
but i do have noticed that there is a
huge<00:02:46.329> difference<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.860> my<00:02:48.130> boot<00:02:48.640> time<00:02:48.940> with<00:02:49.269> my

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
huge difference in my boot time with my

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.770 
huge difference in my boot time with my
imac<00:02:50.220> rather<00:02:51.220> than<00:02:51.910> my<00:02:52.209> macbook<00:02:52.569> air

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
imac rather than my macbook air

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.110 
imac rather than my macbook air
obviously<00:02:53.380> my<00:02:53.530> macbook<00:02:53.920> air<00:02:54.099> if<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.790> compare

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
obviously my macbook air if you compare

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.420 
obviously my macbook air if you compare
from<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.390> last<00:02:55.599> video<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.200> much<00:02:57.129> much

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
from the last video is much much

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.750 
from the last video is much much
different<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.750> anyway<00:02:59.560> that's<00:03:00.310> out<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
different so anyway that's out of the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.030 
different so anyway that's out of the
way<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.209> hope<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.079> guys<00:03:02.230> enjoy<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.799> I
