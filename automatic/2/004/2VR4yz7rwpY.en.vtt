video is intended for runners who want
to<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> best<00:00:23.609> breathing<00:00:24.240> rate<00:00:24.480> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to know what the best breathing rate is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.439 
to know what the best breathing rate is
when<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.710> running<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> answer<00:00:27.300> will

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
when you're running now the answer will

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
when you're running now the answer will
actually<00:00:27.810> depend<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.460> running

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
actually depend on what kind of running

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.840 
actually depend on what kind of running
you<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:30.029> doing<00:00:30.330> easy<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.439> comfortable

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
you are doing easy and comfortable

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
you are doing easy and comfortable
medium<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.180> regular<00:00:33.899> pace<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.559> intense<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
medium to regular pace or intense and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.139 
medium to regular pace or intense and
fast<00:00:36.630> ready<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:38.010> each<00:00:38.250> reading<00:00:38.610> rate<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
fast ready now each reading rate is a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.000 
fast ready now each reading rate is a
little<00:00:39.300> bit<00:00:39.480> different<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
little bit different because as you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.229 
little bit different because as you
increase<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.640> pace

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
increase your pace

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.900 
increase your pace
your<00:00:42.899> body<00:00:43.200> will<00:00:43.440> demand<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.890> oxygen<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
your body will demand more oxygen and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.389 
your body will demand more oxygen and
increase<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> ventilation<00:00:46.710> rate<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.219> you're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
increase the ventilation rate so you're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.250 
increase the ventilation rate so you're
gonna<00:00:47.489> breathe<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.120> harder<00:00:48.510> let's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
gonna breathe a little bit harder let's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
gonna breathe a little bit harder let's
go<00:00:49.469> over<00:00:49.649> breathing<00:00:49.920> rates<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> find<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
go over breathing rates and find the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
go over breathing rates and find the
answer<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.600> best<00:00:51.870> breathing<00:00:52.469> rate

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
answer for the best breathing rate

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.250 
answer for the best breathing rate
that's<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.780> now<00:00:54.780> breathing

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that's right for you now breathing

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
that's right for you now breathing
rhythms<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.980> easy<00:00:56.250> comfortable<00:00:57.120> running<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
rhythms for easy comfortable running is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.099 
rhythms for easy comfortable running is
what<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.079> call<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.500> 3<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.010> 3<00:00:59.309> breathing<00:00:59.879> rate

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
what we call a 3 to 3 breathing rate

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
what we call a 3 to 3 breathing rate
meaning<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.350> every<00:01:01.559> 3<00:01:01.800> steps<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.340> take<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
meaning for every 3 steps you take you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.130 
meaning for every 3 steps you take you
an<00:01:03.120> inhale<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.970> 3<00:01:05.970> steps<00:01:06.299> after<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
an inhale and 3 steps after that you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
an inhale and 3 steps after that you
would<00:01:07.260> exhale

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
would exhale

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520 
would exhale
so<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.729> about<00:01:08.880> 3<00:01:09.240> seconds<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.350> at

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so it's about 3 seconds to be then at

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
so it's about 3 seconds to be then at
about<00:01:10.680> 3<00:01:11.040> seconds<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.970> beat<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:13.490> now<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
about 3 seconds to beat out now that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.469 
about 3 seconds to beat out now that
will<00:01:15.689> help<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.530> doing<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.280> easy<00:01:17.640> runs<00:01:18.000> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
will help you doing your easy runs so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.820 
will help you doing your easy runs so
that<00:01:18.630> way<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.930> maintain<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.590> good

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that way you can maintain a good

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
that way you can maintain a good
ventilation<00:01:20.220> rate<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:21.479> let's<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.900> over

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
ventilation rate now let's go over

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
ventilation rate now let's go over
breathing<00:01:22.320> rhythms<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.130> medium<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.520> regular

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
breathing rhythms for medium to regular

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
breathing rhythms for medium to regular
running<00:01:24.650> now<00:01:25.650> breathing<00:01:25.979> rhythms<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.729> medium

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
running now breathing rhythms for medium

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.210 
running now breathing rhythms for medium
to<00:01:27.060> weather<00:01:27.360> running<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.890> called<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to weather running it's what we called a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.020 
to weather running it's what we called a
2<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> 2<00:01:29.880> breathing<00:01:30.420> rate<00:01:31.430> now<00:01:32.430> two<00:01:32.490> steps

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
2 to 2 breathing rate now two steps

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.280 
2 to 2 breathing rate now two steps
you're<00:01:33.360> gonna<00:01:33.479> inhale<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:36.720> two<00:01:37.229> steps

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you're gonna inhale and then two steps

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.580 
you're gonna inhale and then two steps
to<00:01:37.920> exhale<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.689> breathing<00:01:40.049> rhythm<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to exhale now this breathing rhythm is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.429 
to exhale now this breathing rhythm is
preferred<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.070> most<00:01:41.610> runs<00:01:42.150> since<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.350> gets

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
preferred for most runs since it gets

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.219 
preferred for most runs since it gets
the<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:43.890> amount<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> oxygen<00:01:45.049> right<00:01:46.049> into

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the right amount of oxygen right into

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
the right amount of oxygen right into
your<00:01:46.350> system<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.369> muscles<00:01:47.790> would

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
your system so the muscles would

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
your system so the muscles would
actually<00:01:48.299> benefit<00:01:48.689> better<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.439> you're

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
actually benefit better because you're

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.210 
actually benefit better because you're
taking<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.880> seconds<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.560> two

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
taking two seconds to be then and two

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.160 
taking two seconds to be then and two
seconds<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.820> EXO<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.630> given<00:01:54.869> your

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
seconds to EXO so you're given your

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.209 
seconds to EXO so you're given your
lungs<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.369> chance<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.750> only<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
lungs a chance to not only get the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.690 
lungs a chance to not only get the
oxygen<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.969> uh<00:02:00.000> diffuse<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.950> oxygen<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
oxygen but uh diffuse the oxygen to the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.209 
oxygen but uh diffuse the oxygen to the
right<00:02:02.909> muscles<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:04.140> breathing<00:02:04.530> rhythms<00:02:04.979> for

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
right muscles now breathing rhythms for

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.359 
right muscles now breathing rhythms for
intense<00:02:05.700> or<00:02:06.299> fast<00:02:06.719> running<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.280> bit

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
intense or fast running is a little bit
