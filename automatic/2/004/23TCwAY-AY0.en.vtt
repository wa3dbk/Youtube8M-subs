00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.720
 i 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.699
 let's explain the simple three 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 exercises the number 64 and 66 the three 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.810
 They are opening with pulley of openings of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 pectorals and pulleys and what we're going to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.989
 change is the position of the bank 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.500
 inclined direct plane the difference 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.629
 between the openings and the pulley pressure 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.480
 is that in the presi we selected 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.399
 we stretch all here the elbow is going to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.579
 stay in the same position throughout 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.579
 the route 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.929
 we go 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.299
 maintaining that same position and from 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.299
 here we go back up keeping 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:31.100
 and second if I'm going to explain a way 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.260
 where you can use a little more 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.590
 exercise difficulties at the end of the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.220
 travel just when we are up the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.220
 partner 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.370
 we have to maintain that strength 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.360
 the force 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.530
 yes 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.459
 something that you have to consider here 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:32.500
 it's warm down we should not wait 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.769
 more than 6 able to control it with the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.769
 weather 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.319
 on the way it is important to arrive 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.379
 down I recommend the openings 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.190
 more alcoleas in cufflink 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.840
 agreement because the moment when more 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.390
 delicate is the bet that you feel 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.819
 over the shoulder for sure is that there 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.920
 a lot of distance but the movement up 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.280
 the place where we have placed the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.909
 load that makes there really much 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.670
 more joint stress 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.069
 in this segment x that more distance and 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.010
 from that point to this other 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.170
 when we are with some dumbbells 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.819
 Ropes are a resistance and need 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.380
 means that the door that exerts 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.580
 implant entertains the floor 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:26.930
 when a force attacks 90 degrees from 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:37.240
 axis all the putting that the others do 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:45.140
 general about this which means that the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:50.440
 work is really dedicated the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.440
 force with which it attacks the shaft 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:09.740
 because whenever you can do 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.740
 a dumbbell especially to start 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.730
 probably going to have a musculature 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.730
 That allows him 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.590
 for the field 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.930
 so in this position 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.140
 ah 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.920
 putting something 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.270
 we have
