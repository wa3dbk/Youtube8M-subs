00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:17.400
 Oh, and then the ball rolls a new beauty. 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.439
 Stop talking, one thing begins. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.570
 strength is difficult to increase weight in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.789
 gym was out of your breath 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.340
 I think they should do the reps and I know 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 have you tried everything in the diet new and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.960
 also supplements and cassava or 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.730
 almost nothing turns on the sea is starting 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 the video of this getting ports 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.420
 marola in this video is being dedicated 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.390
 for the alexandre fable 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.940
 he commented on his lack of strength 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.610
 in their training in coincidence this is 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 one of the sad themes justifying that 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.250
 you can also comment on the suggestions 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.469
 criticism of the opinion of people who are the channel 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.869
 very interactive with you 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.479
 knowing that you like that you are 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.610
 liking what our channel looks like 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.369
 this helps a lot to direct 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.860
 our focus too so you can give the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.380
 your comment there I asked for a video that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.420
 as far as possible we make a video 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.450
 on a subject that you have 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.860
 interest in 11 a lot of people do not know anymore 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.050
 strength and endurance 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.179
 you earn by doing the specific training to 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.300
 This is of course the food is super 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.310
 important but if you do not practice you 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.800
 will always keep the same level 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 our body has three types of fibers 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.960
 muscle fibers beyond 50% of the fibers 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.569
 of our body is a fiber of 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.379
 resistance and we have two fibers also 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:50.319
 that is 1 to 2 and to 2 

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:52.660
 form the other 50% of the fibers of our 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.030
 ie we are predominant 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.489
 formed for existence by summing up 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.440
 we have three kinds of fiber does not 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.869
 To do only one type of training 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.569
 therefore we should prioritize our train 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.789
 of strength resistance by atrophy so 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.289
 you work all the fibers of the body and 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.509
 consequently generates better 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.330
 results galera many want to get up 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.870
 more weight than in practice for this 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.980
 you train strength and endurance 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.769
 consequently you also improve the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.530
 hypertrophy since more weight lifted 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.810
 It's the same but broken and more children 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.239
 go lives therefore it is equal to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.459
 more for the trophy but it is clear to this 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.930
 You have to maintain a good diet. 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.760
 a shrimp thing to also always 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.830
 forget it, we 'll always have this 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.140
 exchanging training and also the diet 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.970
 It's always good to have new people a tip. 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.909
 important we are always 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.590
 concerned about catabolism but 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.700
 people do not know that a big enemy 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.890
 Ours is also homeostasis homeostasis 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 defense of our body to body 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.540
 function in our organism is to maintain 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.250
 our system is state and with it all 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.680
 long diet and all treatment 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.300
 repetitive long term 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.730
 ceased to be well utilized by the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.700
 body because it's here then 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.160
 guys, we should always be in fernando. 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.580
 our body and how I do it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.560
 you just make period changes and 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.750
 period in your diet and in your 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.670
 training these changes are always 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.010
 well used by our body 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.280
 because the adjustment for period dances in 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.440
 period does not give the time ag agencies 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.810
 it is this is the main strategy of the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.510
 Barueri is always guaranteed our 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.730
 body breaking homeostasis do this 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.280
 you also get results every time 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.060
 and never stagnate a certain weight 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.920
 measure 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.720
 she then returned to the focus of 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.650
 You do not have the strength or the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.840
 resistance 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.150
 simply because you do not train to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.280
 your 30 and will only come back to the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.190
 hypertrophy the ideal is to make a 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.950
 periodization with the three types of training 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.840
 in the week doing resistance strength and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.940
 hypertrophy you can use several 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.160
 training methods like the super 77 drop 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.650
 73 to so many types of training per se 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.230
 Do you choose the best for you? 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.069
 will differentiate between the three types and 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.019
 intensity and number of repetitions 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.269
 strength training make five sets of 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.729
 three to five repetitions with the load 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.739
 heavy and what would be a heavy load 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.919
 if you are 80 pounds on each side in the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.960
 supine at 41 minutes rest 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.490
 each series you increase the load 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.620
 and you have to make three to five 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.300
 repetitions but caution is advisable 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.419
 Do you have someone helping you to go to 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.120
 Avoid Accidents Resistance Workout 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.430
 passes four sets of 15 to 20 reflections 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.550
 with regular weight you can handle you 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.340
 make the pillow run properly 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.039
 ranges from 30 to 60 seconds of training 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.349
 hypertrophy 10 to 12 repetitions with weight 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.180
 also where you forget one or more 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.050
 two minutes remembering that for the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.610
 hypertrophy 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.189
 we are in favor of going to failure 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.669
 I managed to go from 12 repetitions per cent 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.669
 like this 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.380
 guys video conclusion 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.810
 The idea is that we want to spend is you. 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.750
 know how to train strength also 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.270
 not only hypertrophy but also change 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.250
 periodically do not stay in the 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.590
 same in the same training 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.270
 this makes you no longer able to 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.490
 develop and apply these 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.340
 strategies that we have left for you 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.120
 strength resistance is very important in 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.370
 bodybuilding 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.470
 if you practice I'm sure 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.020
 will not improve its province either. 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.449
 forget to feed yourself well as vegetables 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.280
 vegetables are rich in vitamins 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.500
 this greatly enhances your strength and 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.840
 resistance if you do not like vegetables 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.759
 vegetables or also did not ease 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.440
 is always buying use 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.090
 multivitamin will supply these 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.710
 needs and also another 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.520
 facing supplement for strength and 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.680
 creatine 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.360
 but do not forget to biava and super 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.319
 important people we are getting 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.509
 around here 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.259
 We hope to help you with this more 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.050
 video 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.000
 Thank you so much for following us, this is it. 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.310
 there another side we thank thalamus 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.900
 together here shows to strengthen 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.090
 more and more of our lives there 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.419
