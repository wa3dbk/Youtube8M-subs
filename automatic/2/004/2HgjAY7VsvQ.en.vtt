tricks inside a wind tunnel for me to do
my<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.220> time<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.640> any<00:00:20.939> feeling<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.750> modes

my first time with any feeling as modes
of<00:00:22.080> skydiving<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.980> positioning<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
of skydiving and a positioning and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.920 
of skydiving and a positioning and
aerodynamics<00:00:24.390> which<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:24.869> very

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
aerodynamics which is very very

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.779 
aerodynamics which is very very
important<00:00:25.439> obviously<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.890> both<00:00:26.039> sports<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
important obviously for both sports so

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
important obviously for both sports so
to<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.449> figured<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.140> needed<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> kind

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
to do that we figured we needed to kind

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
to do that we figured we needed to kind
of<00:00:28.920> test<00:00:29.730> each<00:00:29.939> others<00:00:30.210> worlds<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> little

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
of test each others worlds out a little

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
of test each others worlds out a little
bit<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.380> give<00:00:32.219> him<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:32.579> taste<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.149> my

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
bit and give him a little taste of my

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:52.060 
bit and give him a little taste of my
world

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.720
