00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
difference is you know cannot can change

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.270 
difference is you know cannot can change
up<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.880> game<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.450> little<00:02:19.600> bit<00:02:19.960> especially<00:02:20.950> in

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
up the game a little bit especially in

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.040 
up the game a little bit especially in
competitive<00:02:21.730> place<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.360> move<00:02:22.630> does

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
competitive place so this move does

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.650 
competitive place so this move does
still<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.430> same<00:02:24.610> thing<00:02:24.970> pretty<00:02:25.240> much<00:02:25.420> only

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
still do the same thing pretty much only

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.160 
still do the same thing pretty much only
it<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.830> not<00:02:27.490> as<00:02:27.700> close<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.630> don't<00:02:28.690> think

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
it it's not as close in I don't think

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.220 
it it's not as close in I don't think
it's<00:02:29.410> not<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.730> works<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.690> lot<00:02:31.810> better<00:02:32.050> in

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
it's not as it works a lot better in

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.050 
it's not as it works a lot better in
regular<00:02:32.590> Aikido<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.610> move<00:02:33.820> does

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
regular Aikido this this move does

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.890 
regular Aikido this this move does
naturally<00:02:35.050> or<00:02:35.530> whatever<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.360> okay<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.390> we<00:02:37.690> did

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
naturally or whatever so okay so we did

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.380 
naturally or whatever so okay so we did
space<00:02:38.170> once<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:39.460> we<00:02:39.550> do<00:02:39.790> space<00:02:40.060> again

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
space once and then we do space again

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.100 
space once and then we do space again
remember<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:41.550> here's<00:02:42.550> where<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.390> final

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
remember and then here's where the final

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.590 
remember and then here's where the final
turn<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:44.860> we're<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.430> three<00:02:45.700> turns<00:02:46.000> in<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.510> this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
turn so we're in three turns in and this

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.350 
turn so we're in three turns in and this
is<00:02:46.720> where<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.990> lift<00:02:47.440> goes<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:48.070> goes<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.270> a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
is where the lift goes up goes in a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.860 
is where the lift goes up goes in a
little<00:02:49.480> bit<00:02:49.690> okay<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.470> first<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.460> do<00:02:51.850> we<00:02:52.480> press

lifted<00:03:30.250> up<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.610> little<00:03:30.820> bit<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.300> if<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.720> get

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
lifted up a little bit so if you get

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.640 
lifted up a little bit so if you get
this<00:03:32.080> far<00:03:32.459> his<00:03:33.459> body<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.260> be<00:03:35.350> going

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
this far his body is going to be going

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.479 
this far his body is going to be going
you<00:03:36.280> know<00:03:36.630> quite<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.660> quite<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> far<00:03:38.860> away's<00:03:39.160> or

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
you know quite a quite a far away's or

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.920 
you know quite a quite a far away's or
it's<00:03:39.670> not<00:03:39.790> going<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.000> go<00:03:40.090> far<00:03:40.420> away's<00:03:40.600> but<00:03:40.810> it's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
it's not going to go far away's but it's

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.360 
it's not going to go far away's but it's
going<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> knock<00:03:41.350> them<00:03:41.530> off<00:03:41.620> balance<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.220> it's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
going to knock them off balance and it's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.130 
going to knock them off balance and it's
going<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.730> think<00:03:42.940> on<00:03:43.090> on<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.540> toe<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.810> pretty

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
going to think on on this toe is pretty

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.620 
going to think on on this toe is pretty
much<00:03:44.290> well<00:03:44.980> sort<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:46.030> he's<00:03:46.239> going<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.570> to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
much well sort of he's going to have to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.229 
much well sort of he's going to have to
think<00:03:46.810> fast<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.350> guess<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.820> your<00:03:48.970> body

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
think fast I guess but in in your body

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.940 
think fast I guess but in in your body
positioning<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.050> really<00:03:50.320> stable<00:03:50.560> check<00:03:50.830> this

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
positioning is really stable check this

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.910 
positioning is really stable check this
out<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:52.120> that's<00:03:52.989> all<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.769> teach

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
out and so that's all that I can teach

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.560 
out and so that's all that I can teach
you<00:03:53.980> here<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.580> then<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.060> can<00:03:55.180> just<00:03:55.390> keep

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
you here and then you can just keep

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.420 
you here and then you can just keep
pressing<00:03:55.870> space<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.530> your<00:03:56.680> body's<00:03:57.010> not<00:03:57.220> going

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
pressing space and your body's not going

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.900 
pressing space and your body's not going
to<00:03:57.489> move<00:03:57.660> isn't<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.750> nice<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.890> yep<00:04:00.880> that's

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to move isn't that nice so yep that's

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.840 
to move isn't that nice so yep that's
what<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.720> want<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.110> teach<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:03.090> hope<00:04:04.090> you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850

you<00:04:09.640> go<00:04:09.790> up<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.330> then<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.660> do<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.140> tiny<00:04:11.500> little

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
you go up and then you do a tiny little

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.310 
you go up and then you do a tiny little
lift<00:04:12.070> right<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.540> midsection<00:04:13.959> there

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
lift right in that the midsection there

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.310 
lift right in that the midsection there
on<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.680> right<00:04:14.860> side<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:16.510> use<00:04:16.540> pretty<00:04:17.230> much

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
on the right side you use pretty much

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.220 
on the right side you use pretty much
their<00:04:18.100> their<00:04:18.669> armpit<00:04:19.209> pretty<00:04:19.540> much<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.080> get

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
their their armpit pretty much to get

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.599 
their their armpit pretty much to get
the<00:04:20.470> lift<00:04:20.830> in

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
the lift in

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.480 
the lift in
and<00:04:22.569> I<00:04:23.020> think<00:04:23.349> it<00:04:23.439> does<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.620> pretty<00:04:23.860> good<00:04:23.949> job<00:04:24.099> I

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
and I think it does a pretty good job I

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.610 
and I think it does a pretty good job I
can't<00:04:24.819> wait<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.270> try<00:04:25.689> this<00:04:25.810> in<00:04:26.139> competitive
