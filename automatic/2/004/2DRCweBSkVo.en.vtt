the reason I picked him was because i

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.690 
the reason I picked him was because i

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
maps and I was like share and I didn't

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.670 
maps and I was like share and I didn't
know<00:00:36.550> what<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.760> expect<00:00:36.900> and<00:00:37.900> I<00:00:38.020> saw<00:00:38.230> these<00:00:38.410> at

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
know what to expect and I saw these at

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.200 
know what to expect and I saw these at
first<00:00:38.950> I<00:00:39.160> was<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.310> little<00:00:39.340> iffy<00:00:39.670> with<00:00:40.000> them

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
first I was a little iffy with them

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.840 
first I was a little iffy with them
because<00:00:40.870> they<00:00:41.740> are<00:00:41.770> kind<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.250> different<00:00:42.370> they

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
because they are kind of different they

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.380 
because they are kind of different they
are<00:00:42.880> very<00:00:43.840> short<00:00:44.310> however<00:00:45.310> I<00:00:45.640> actually<00:00:45.940> really

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
are very short however I actually really

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.240 
are very short however I actually really
liked<00:00:46.540> his<00:00:46.720> maps<00:00:46.930> because<00:00:47.290> their<00:00:47.980> way

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
liked his maps because their way

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.090 
liked his maps because their way
different<00:00:48.780> um<00:00:49.780> they<00:00:50.320> don't<00:00:50.500> have<00:00:50.650> anyone

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
different um they don't have anyone

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.819 
different um they don't have anyone
else's<00:00:51.430> style<00:00:51.790> really<00:00:52.210> in<00:00:52.480> them<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:53.620> only

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
else's style really in them the only

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.500 
else's style really in them the only
problem<00:00:54.070> on<00:00:54.220> this<00:00:54.340> map<00:00:54.579> is<00:00:54.820> sometimes<00:00:55.300> that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
problem on this map is sometimes that

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.819 
problem on this map is sometimes that
jump<00:00:55.780> if<00:00:55.900> you're<00:00:56.020> not<00:00:56.110> ready<00:00:56.320> for<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.620> back

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
jump if you're not ready for it back

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.400 
jump if you're not ready for it back
their<00:00:57.130> messes<00:00:58.000> up<00:00:58.149> in<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.480> jump<00:00:58.780> right<00:00:58.960> here

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
their messes up in this jump right here

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.780 
their messes up in this jump right here
is<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.340> hard<00:01:00.640> landing<00:01:01.090> so<00:01:01.450> I<00:01:01.480> can<00:01:01.750> mess<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.930> up

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
is a hard landing so I can mess you up

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.730 
is a hard landing so I can mess you up
but<00:01:03.790> other<00:01:03.940> than<00:01:04.030> that<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:05.019> map<00:01:05.199> works<00:01:05.440> well

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
but other than that the map works well

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.700 
but other than that the map works well
it<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.760> shorter<00:01:07.120> side<00:01:07.150> but<00:01:07.690> his<00:01:08.440> maps

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
it is on the shorter side but his maps

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.530 
it is on the shorter side but his maps
are<00:01:08.920> really<00:01:09.729> cool<00:01:09.880> because<00:01:09.940> their<00:01:10.420> way

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
are really cool because their way

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.870 
are really cool because their way
different<00:01:10.990> they're<00:01:11.800> more<00:01:12.190> focused<00:01:12.370> on

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
different they're more focused on

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.510 
different they're more focused on
scenery<00:01:13.540> kind<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:14.770> duquesne<00:01:15.190> on<00:01:15.370> our

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
scenery kind of like duquesne on our

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.289 
scenery kind of like duquesne on our
Channel<00:01:15.940> but<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:18.490> know<00:01:18.549> exactly<00:01:19.000> how<00:01:19.240> to

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
Channel but I don't know exactly how to

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.360 
Channel but I don't know exactly how to
describe<00:01:19.780> them<00:01:20.110> they're<00:01:20.770> really<00:01:20.979> cool<00:01:21.130> though

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
describe them they're really cool though

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.840 
describe them they're really cool though
I<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:22.870> one<00:01:22.930> go<00:01:23.710> jump<00:01:24.159> right<00:01:24.340> there<00:01:24.430> too

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
I like this one go jump right there too

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.930 
I like this one go jump right there too
it's<00:01:25.840> got<00:01:26.110> some<00:01:26.500> plum<00:01:26.710> jumps<00:01:27.159> it's<00:01:27.520> mostly

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
it's got some plum jumps it's mostly

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's got some plum jumps it's mostly
bordered<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.570> it's<00:01:28.720> pretty<00:01:28.990> hard<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.260> fall<00:01:29.500> off

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
bordered so it's pretty hard to fall off

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
bordered so it's pretty hard to fall off
besides<00:01:30.790> maybe<00:01:31.090> right<00:01:31.390> here<00:01:31.420> on<00:01:31.990> this<00:01:32.229> jump

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
besides maybe right here on this jump

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.080 
besides maybe right here on this jump
it's<00:01:35.409> really<00:01:35.830> competitive<00:01:35.979> for<00:01:36.700> like<00:01:36.909> when

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
it's really competitive for like when

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.460 
it's really competitive for like when
you<00:01:37.180> have<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.360> lot<00:01:37.510> of<00:01:37.540> people<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.110> know<00:01:38.229> since

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
you have a lot of people you know since

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.190 
you have a lot of people you know since
it's<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.710> tightly<00:01:39.540> compacted<00:01:40.540> map<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.960> guess

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
it's a tightly compacted map I guess

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's a tightly compacted map I guess
it's<00:01:41.950> good<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:42.369> pushing<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.729> lot<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:43.000> people

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
it's good for pushing a lot of people

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's good for pushing a lot of people
and<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:44.500> know<00:01:44.619> keeps<00:01:44.950> things<00:01:45.189> intense<00:01:45.549> i<00:01:45.850> like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
and you know keeps things intense i like

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.940 
and you know keeps things intense i like
the<00:01:46.600> little<00:01:46.689> scenic<00:01:47.229> tower<00:01:47.439> there<00:01:47.650> i'm<00:01:47.799> not

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
the little scenic tower there i'm not

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.480 
the little scenic tower there i'm not
exactly<00:01:48.250> sure<00:01:48.430> what<00:01:48.729> it's<00:01:48.880> supposed<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.270> be

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
exactly sure what it's supposed to be

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.130 
exactly sure what it's supposed to be
yes<00:01:51.490> i<00:01:51.729> was<00:01:51.970> using<00:01:52.150> boy<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.510> milk<00:01:52.689> man's<00:01:52.900> view

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.289 
here because I I guess wasn't playing
while<00:01:55.689> i<00:01:55.720> take<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> clips<00:01:56.259> but<00:01:57.100> uh<00:01:57.130> he<00:01:58.060> failed

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
while i take the clips but uh he failed

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.679 
while i take the clips but uh he failed
there<00:01:59.729> anyways<00:02:00.729> definitely<00:02:01.240> give<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:01.360> map<00:02:01.659> a

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
there anyways definitely give this map a

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.719 
there anyways definitely give this map a
try<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.259> way<00:02:02.409> different<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.369> think<00:02:03.610> it's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
try it's way different and I think it's

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.690 
try it's way different and I think it's
really<00:02:03.790> cool<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:06.040> called<00:02:06.220> coastline

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
really cool it's called coastline

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.309 
really cool it's called coastline
circuit<00:02:07.119> by<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.299> way<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.689> don't<00:02:07.960> think<00:02:08.079> I<00:02:08.139> went

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
circuit by the way I don't think I went

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.490 
circuit by the way I don't think I went
to<00:02:08.409> rent

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.720 

this<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.750> electric<00:02:13.750> forest<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.530> there's<00:02:15.460> as

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
this is a electric forest one there's as

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.450 
this is a electric forest one there's as
you<00:02:16.360> might<00:02:16.690> guess<00:02:17.080> electric<00:02:17.800> force<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.280> as

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
you might guess electric force to as

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.580 
you might guess electric force to as
well<00:02:18.700> oh<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.690> electric<00:02:20.050> forest<00:02:20.320> one

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
well oh this is electric forest one

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.570 
well oh this is electric forest one
again<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.490> shorter<00:02:22.090> map<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:23.680> like<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.070> whole<00:02:24.430> lot

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
again a shorter map not like a whole lot

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.630 
again a shorter map not like a whole lot
of<00:02:24.640> sky<00:02:25.090> or<00:02:25.510> smooth<00:02:26.200> big<00:02:26.890> turns<00:02:27.190> or<00:02:27.400> whatever

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
of sky or smooth big turns or whatever

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.540 
of sky or smooth big turns or whatever
but<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:28.570> definitely<00:02:29.140> judge<00:02:29.740> madala<00:02:30.100> style

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
but it's definitely judge madala style

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.150 
but it's definitely judge madala style
because<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.690> shorter<00:02:32.080> map<00:02:32.260> mostly

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
because it's a shorter map mostly

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.120 
because it's a shorter map mostly

electric<00:03:07.720> forest<00:03:08.020> it's<00:03:08.680> kind<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.520> short<00:03:09.900> which

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
electric forest it's kind of short which

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.330 
electric forest it's kind of short which
is<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.050> bummer<00:03:11.260> because<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.739> actually<00:03:11.980> love

judge<00:03:12.550> madalas<00:03:13.060> maps<00:03:13.300> they're<00:03:14.020> really<00:03:14.260> fun<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
judge madalas maps they're really fun I

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.470 
judge madalas maps they're really fun I
don't<00:03:15.760> know<00:03:15.820> it's<00:03:16.000> just<00:03:16.120> something<00:03:16.390> about

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
don't know it's just something about

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.330 
don't know it's just something about
them<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.290> original<00:03:17.769> i<00:03:17.890> really

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.070 
them that's just so original i really
like<00:03:18.489> them<00:03:18.670> i<00:03:18.790> don't<00:03:18.820> know<00:03:19.000> why<00:03:19.180> but<00:03:19.450> they're

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
like them i don't know why but they're

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.440 
like them i don't know why but they're
really<00:03:20.350> cool<00:03:22.170> mmm<00:03:23.730> that's<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.940> only<00:03:25.120> problem

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
really cool mmm that's the only problem

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.090 
really cool mmm that's the only problem
now<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.690> they're<00:03:25.930> short<00:03:26.170> right<00:03:26.860> here<00:03:27.070> i

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
now is that they're short right here i

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.430 
now is that they're short right here i
love<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.430> tunnel<00:03:27.880> it's<00:03:28.239> really<00:03:28.959> cool<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
love this tunnel it's really cool the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.410 
love this tunnel it's really cool the
way<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.560> colors<00:03:29.860> are<00:03:30.430> used<00:03:30.760> I'm<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.180> exactly

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
way the colors are used I'm not exactly

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.030 
way the colors are used I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:31.630> what<00:03:31.870> effects<00:03:32.110> he<00:03:32.260> has<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.530> i'm<00:03:32.650> guessing

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
sure what effects he has on i'm guessing

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.970 
sure what effects he has on i'm guessing
purple<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.730> maybe<00:03:33.970> something<00:03:34.390> else<00:03:34.510> or<00:03:35.019> juicy

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
purple and maybe something else or juicy

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.110 
purple and maybe something else or juicy
and<00:03:36.070> something<00:03:36.430> else<00:03:36.519> but<00:03:36.760> i<00:03:36.820> think<00:03:37.030> it's

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
and something else but i think it's

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.690 
and something else but i think it's
purple<00:03:37.620> about<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.709> way<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.920> lights<00:03:39.190> reflect

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
purple about the way the lights reflect

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.670 
purple about the way the lights reflect
with<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.970> purple<00:03:40.360> in<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:41.110> background<00:03:41.560> it

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
with the purple in the background it

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.000 
with the purple in the background it
looks<00:03:41.829> really<00:03:42.040> cool<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.200> again<00:03:44.590> he's<00:03:44.739> got<00:03:44.860> one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
looks really cool and again he's got one

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.340 
looks really cool and again he's got one
of<00:03:45.040> those<00:03:45.160> cool<00:03:45.400> towers<00:03:45.820> like<00:03:46.660> he<00:03:46.810> did<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:46.989> the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
of those cool towers like he did on the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.789 
of those cool towers like he did on the
coastline<00:03:47.890> circuit<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:50.290> yeah<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.739> a

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
coastline circuit and yeah so it's a

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.030 
coastline circuit and yeah so it's a
shorter<00:03:51.100> map<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.610> fun<00:03:51.820> definitely<00:03:52.450> I'm

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
shorter map but it's fun definitely I'm

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.229 
shorter map but it's fun definitely I'm
give<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.250> try<00:03:54.610> oh<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.579> dissolve<00:03:57.970> didn't

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
give it a try oh the dissolve didn't

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.990 
give it a try oh the dissolve didn't
work<00:03:58.420> for<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.750> part<00:03:59.430> guess<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.549> forgot<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.910> add

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
work for that part guess I forgot to add

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.690 
work for that part guess I forgot to add
it<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.299> anyways<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.290> um<00:04:02.650> electric<00:04:03.489> force

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
it but anyways this is um electric force

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.050 
it but anyways this is um electric force
too<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:05.680> know<00:04:05.739> technically<00:04:06.459> it's<00:04:06.700> using

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
too and I know technically it's using

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.420 
too and I know technically it's using
some<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.959> same<00:04:07.989> parts<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> map<00:04:08.769> but

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
some of the same parts of the map but

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.210 
some of the same parts of the map but
there<00:04:09.610> are<00:04:09.700> several<00:04:10.060> differences<00:04:10.510> as<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.220> can

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
there are several differences as you can

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.590 
there are several differences as you can
see<00:04:12.760> here<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.269> colors<00:04:13.720> are<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> lot<00:04:14.290> different

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
see here the colors are a lot different

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.819 
see here the colors are a lot different
also<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:17.169> going<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.709> reverse

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
also it is going in the reverse

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.729 
also it is going in the reverse
direction<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.910> other<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.500> obviously<00:04:20.500> so

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
direction of the other one obviously so

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.980 
direction of the other one obviously so
that<00:04:20.890> makes<00:04:21.099> it<00:04:21.250> seem<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:22.450> it's<00:04:22.660> not<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
that makes it seem like it's not the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.290 
that makes it seem like it's not the
same<00:04:23.229> map<00:04:23.440> at<00:04:23.620> all<00:04:23.770> which<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.520> really<00:04:24.910> isn't

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
same map at all which it really isn't

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.520 
same map at all which it really isn't
it<00:04:25.389> doesn't<00:04:25.690> even<00:04:25.750> feel<00:04:25.990> like<00:04:26.050> you're<00:04:26.289> racing

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
it doesn't even feel like you're racing

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.140 
it doesn't even feel like you're racing
on<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.710> same<00:04:26.889> map<00:04:27.069> except<00:04:27.430> for<00:04:27.610> maybe<00:04:27.849> this

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
on the same map except for maybe this

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.689 
on the same map except for maybe this
beginning<00:04:28.539> part<00:04:28.889> because<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.310> going<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
beginning part because it's going in the

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.070 
beginning part because it's going in the
opposite<00:04:31.060> direction<00:04:31.180> it's<00:04:31.810> got<00:04:31.960> different

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
opposite direction it's got different

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.749 
opposite direction it's got different
effects<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.710> which<00:04:32.919> make<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.220> lighting<00:04:33.580> and

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
effects on which make the lighting and

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.760 
effects on which make the lighting and
everything<00:04:33.879> way<00:04:34.300> different<00:04:34.659> it's<00:04:35.319> got<00:04:35.500> whole

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
everything way different it's got whole

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.040 
everything way different it's got whole
different<00:04:36.069> parts<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.849> stuff<00:04:37.150> let's<00:04:37.960> go

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
different parts to it and stuff let's go

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.020 
different parts to it and stuff let's go
this<00:04:38.199> whole<00:04:38.379> new<00:04:39.009> tunnel<00:04:39.340> here<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:39.759> using

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
this whole new tunnel here it's using

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.730 
this whole new tunnel here it's using
the<00:04:40.060> original<00:04:40.270> tunnel<00:04:40.780> here<00:04:40.990> going<00:04:41.259> backwards

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
the original tunnel here going backwards

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.279 
the original tunnel here going backwards
but<00:04:42.400> with<00:04:42.490> different<00:04:42.669> lighting<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.330> then<00:04:44.050> it

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
but with different lighting and then it

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.719 
but with different lighting and then it
connects<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.860> bridge<00:04:45.159> over<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.610> this

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
connects with a bridge over to this

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.339 
connects with a bridge over to this
other<00:04:45.879> tunnel<00:04:46.330> into<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.870> right<00:04:47.020> there<00:04:47.199> that

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
other tunnel into the right there that

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:48.960 
other tunnel into the right there that
was<00:04:47.409> a<00:04:47.530> shortcut<00:04:47.979> I<00:04:48.250> don't<00:04:48.460> use<00:04:48.639> it<00:04:48.819> in<00:04:48.879> this

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
was a shortcut I don't use it in this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.550 
was a shortcut I don't use it in this
video<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:49.539> there<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.810> shortcut<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.379> comes

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
video but there is a shortcut that comes

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.700 
video but there is a shortcut that comes
out<00:04:50.740> right<00:04:50.919> about<00:04:51.190> here<00:04:52.199> I'm<00:04:53.199> not<00:04:53.409> sure<00:04:53.560> if<00:04:53.650> you

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
out right about here I'm not sure if you

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.839 
out right about here I'm not sure if you
intended<00:04:54.069> that<00:04:54.129> but<00:04:54.370> I'm<00:04:54.460> guessing<00:04:54.639> because

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
intended that but I'm guessing because

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.230 
intended that but I'm guessing because
there's<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.210> light<00:04:55.389> in<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.539> shortcut<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:58.060> only

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
there's a light in the shortcut the only

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.209 
there's a light in the shortcut the only
thing<00:04:58.389> about<00:04:58.539> this<00:04:58.690> map<00:04:58.960> when<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.830> download

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 
thing about this map when you download

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:02.339 
thing about this map when you download
it<00:05:00.370> which<00:05:00.849> you<00:05:01.030> definitely<00:05:01.479> will<00:05:02.020> or<00:05:02.229> I'll

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
it which you definitely will or I'll

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.399 
it which you definitely will or I'll
hate<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:03.150> I'm<00:05:04.150> sorry<00:05:04.690> geez<00:05:05.319> but<00:05:05.889> um<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:07.409> two

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
hate you I'm sorry geez but um is two

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.180 
hate you I'm sorry geez but um is two
laps<00:05:08.710> or<00:05:09.039> two<00:05:09.400> times<00:05:09.729> around<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.690> map

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
laps or two times around the map

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.409 
laps or two times around the map
technically<00:05:12.190> counts<00:05:12.610> as<00:05:12.729> one<00:05:12.909> lap<00:05:13.150> I'm

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
technically counts as one lap I'm

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.209 
technically counts as one lap I'm
guessing<00:05:14.110> he<00:05:14.229> want<00:05:14.409> to<00:05:14.500> make<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.740> track<00:05:14.949> a<00:05:14.979> bit

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
guessing he want to make the track a bit

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.899 
guessing he want to make the track a bit
longer<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:16.770> when<00:05:17.770> you're<00:05:17.949> racing<00:05:18.129> three<00:05:18.669> laps

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
longer so when you're racing three laps

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.059 
longer so when you're racing three laps
it'll<00:05:19.300> technically<00:05:19.810> be<00:05:19.960> six<00:05:20.289> laps<00:05:20.500> around<00:05:20.740> to

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
it'll technically be six laps around to

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.209 
it'll technically be six laps around to
complete<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:22.590> which<00:05:23.590> is<00:05:23.740> kind<00:05:23.979> of<00:05:24.039> confusing

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
complete that which is kind of confusing

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:25.890 
complete that which is kind of confusing
at<00:05:24.699> first<00:05:24.729> but<00:05:25.150> it's<00:05:25.330> cool<00:05:25.479> because<00:05:25.509> it's<00:05:25.840> a

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
at first but it's cool because it's a

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.170 
at first but it's cool because it's a
shorter<00:05:26.259> map<00:05:26.469> and<00:05:26.740> since<00:05:27.580> judgment<00:05:28.000> all<00:05:28.090> it

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
shorter map and since judgment all it

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.580 
shorter map and since judgment all it
makes<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.479> shorter<00:05:28.780> maps<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.169> guess<00:05:29.319> it<00:05:29.440> works

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
makes the shorter maps I guess it works

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.709 
makes the shorter maps I guess it works
out<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.919> he<00:05:30.009> does<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.460> I<00:05:30.699> really<00:05:31.419> like<00:05:31.569> this

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
out that he does that I really like this

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.300 
out that he does that I really like this
little<00:05:31.900> bridge<00:05:32.169> here<00:05:32.440> though<00:05:32.590> it's<00:05:32.860> very

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
little bridge here though it's very

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.279 
little bridge here though it's very
realistic<00:05:33.610> looking<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.270> me<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.719> then<00:05:35.139> you<00:05:35.199> go

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
realistic looking to me and then you go

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.870 
realistic looking to me and then you go
into<00:05:35.319> this<00:05:35.560> tunnel<00:05:35.979> which<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.610> feel<00:05:36.789> is

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
into this tunnel which you feel is

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.249 
into this tunnel which you feel is
bordered<00:05:37.180> on<00:05:37.240> both<00:05:37.449> sides<00:05:37.750> it<00:05:37.870> would<00:05:37.990> kind<00:05:38.229> of

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
bordered on both sides it would kind of

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.529 
bordered on both sides it would kind of
