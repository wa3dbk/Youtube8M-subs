00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
snaring resistant and when I ask people

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.099 
snaring resistant and when I ask people
if<00:00:25.609> they've<00:00:25.760> got<00:00:25.970> them<00:00:26.150> most<00:00:26.599> people<00:00:26.960> do

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
if they've got them most people do

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.210 
if they've got them most people do
they've<00:00:27.349> got<00:00:27.500> them<00:00:27.590> in<00:00:27.650> their<00:00:27.769> tackle<00:00:28.099> box

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
they've got them in their tackle box

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.769 
they've got them in their tackle box
because<00:00:28.429> they<00:00:28.580> bought<00:00:28.820> them<00:00:29.060> because<00:00:29.539> they

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
because they bought them because they

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.749 
because they bought them because they
look<00:00:29.929> like<00:00:30.080> such<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.439> good<00:00:30.710> lure<00:00:30.920> but<00:00:31.640> they

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
look like such a good lure but they

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.369 
look like such a good lure but they
don't<00:00:31.970> rig<00:00:32.090> them<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.480> they<00:00:32.689> very<00:00:32.989> rarely<00:00:33.019> put

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
don't rig them and they very rarely put

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.170 
don't rig them and they very rarely put
them<00:00:33.500> on<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:33.860> they<00:00:34.250> don't<00:00:34.430> know<00:00:34.519> how<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.790> use

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
them on and they don't know how to use

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.090 
them on and they don't know how to use
them<00:00:35.420> what<00:00:36.290> I'm<00:00:36.350> going<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.559> show<00:00:36.680> you<00:00:36.739> is<00:00:37.070> a

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
them what I'm going to show you is a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.030 
them what I'm going to show you is a
really<00:00:37.309> how<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:37.670> do<00:00:37.879> it<00:00:38.149> very<00:00:38.410> simple<00:00:39.410> very<00:00:39.559> easy

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
really how I do it very simple very easy

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.319 
really how I do it very simple very easy
then<00:00:40.340> I'll<00:00:40.460> show<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:40.640> how<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:40.820> fish<00:00:41.059> with<00:00:41.239> it

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
then I'll show you how to fish with it

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.340 
then I'll show you how to fish with it
and<00:00:41.480> actually<00:00:42.079> how<00:00:42.559> snag<00:00:43.460> resistant<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.059> is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
and actually how snag resistant it is

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.440 
and actually how snag resistant it is
first<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:45.469> get<00:00:45.590> out<00:00:45.710> our<00:00:46.129> prawn<00:00:46.910> star<00:00:47.180> this

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
first we get out our prawn star this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.260 
first we get out our prawn star this
particular<00:00:47.780> models<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.350> Junior<00:00:48.940> what<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:49.969> have

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
particular models the Junior what I have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.010 
particular models the Junior what I have
done<00:00:50.420> is<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.649> use<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.829> larger<00:00:52.340> hook<00:00:52.460> in<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.699> belly

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
done is I use a larger hook in the belly

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.860 
done is I use a larger hook in the belly
because<00:00:54.020> prawns<00:00:54.520> naturally<00:00:55.520> have<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.510> sharp

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
because prawns naturally have a sharp

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.569 
because prawns naturally have a sharp
pointing<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.500> one<00:00:57.620> end<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.250> sharp

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
pointing in and one end and a sharp

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.490 
pointing in and one end and a sharp
pointy<00:00:58.969> end<00:00:59.090> than<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.210> other<00:00:59.270> most<00:01:00.050> predatory

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
pointy end than the other most predatory

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.660 
pointy end than the other most predatory
fish<00:01:00.680> grab<00:01:00.949> them<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.250> middle

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
fish grab them in the middle

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.639 
fish grab them in the middle
so<00:01:02.449> most<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.809> hook<00:01:02.989> ups<00:01:03.170> are<00:01:03.289> on<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:03.469> middle

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
so most you hook ups are on that middle

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.859 
so most you hook ups are on that middle
hook<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.970> ones<00:01:05.149> that<00:01:05.269> come<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.570> packet

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
hook the ones that come in the packet

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.200 
hook the ones that come in the packet
are<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:05.990> little<00:01:06.140> small<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.280> up<00:01:07.640> sized<00:01:07.910> them

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
are a little small so I up sized them

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.150 
are a little small so I up sized them
especially<00:01:09.080> where<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.259> fish<00:01:09.649> where<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.069> fish

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
especially where I fish where the fish

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.010 
especially where I fish where the fish
are<00:01:10.399> a<00:01:10.429> little<00:01:10.550> bigger<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:11.060> up<00:01:11.599> sized<00:01:11.840> that

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
are a little bigger so up sized that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.449 
are a little bigger so up sized that
hook<00:01:12.200> in<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.380> middle<00:01:12.470> doesn't<00:01:13.099> affect<00:01:13.369> the

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
hook in the middle doesn't affect the

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.880 
hook in the middle doesn't affect the
hook<00:01:13.610> up<00:01:13.759> in<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.479> snag<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.319> affects<00:01:15.740> your

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
hook up in the snag but it affects your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.249 
hook up in the snag but it affects your
hook<00:01:16.039> up<00:01:16.190> right<00:01:16.429> on<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.030> fish<00:01:17.209> so<00:01:18.050> I'll<00:01:18.110> show

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
hook up right on the fish so I'll show

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.580 
hook up right on the fish so I'll show
you<00:01:18.349> how<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.500> do<00:01:18.679> it<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:18.920> three<00:01:19.340> easy<00:01:19.580> steps

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
you how to do it in three easy steps

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.040 
you how to do it in three easy steps
so<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:21.679> have<00:01:21.830> our<00:01:21.860> prawn<00:01:22.190> star<00:01:22.490> Junior<00:01:23.050> when

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
so we have our prawn star Junior when

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.449 
so we have our prawn star Junior when
you<00:01:24.110> get<00:01:24.229> them<00:01:24.319> out<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.619> packet<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.340> have

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
you get them out of the packet they have

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.749 
you get them out of the packet they have
a<00:01:25.490> hook<00:01:25.700> in<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:25.880> belly<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.330> holcomb<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.259> tail

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
a hook in the belly and holcomb the tail

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.600 
a hook in the belly and holcomb the tail
what<00:01:28.759> we<00:01:28.880> do<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.330> we<00:01:29.450> put<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.780> larger<00:01:29.959> hook

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
what we do is we put the larger hook

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.719 
what we do is we put the larger hook
back<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.880> belly<00:01:32.060> in<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.690> belly<00:01:32.869> cavity

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
back in the belly in the belly cavity

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.389 
back in the belly in the belly cavity
and<00:01:34.729> clicks<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.239> and<00:01:35.739> we<00:01:36.739> place<00:01:36.950> our<00:01:37.160> leader

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
and clicks in and we place our leader

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.770 
and clicks in and we place our leader
material<00:01:37.610> in<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:39.229> hole<00:01:39.410> on<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.679> top<00:01:40.780> which

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
material in the hole on the top which

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.900 
material in the hole on the top which
means<00:01:41.959> it<00:01:42.170> goes<00:01:42.289> through<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.830> hook<00:01:43.039> in<00:01:43.429> the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
means it goes through the hook in the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.109 
means it goes through the hook in the
center<00:01:44.440> then<00:01:45.440> when<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:45.679> pull<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.890> out<00:01:46.099> I<00:01:46.340> place

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
center then when we pull it out I place

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:56.280 
center then when we pull it out I place
three<00:01:47.840> beads<00:01:48.170> on<00:01:48.410> me<00:01:51.849> one

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:07.390 

-<00:01:58.120> and<00:01:59.120> just<00:01:59.750> will<00:01:59.870> be<00:01:59.960> luck<00:02:00.400> number<00:02:01.400> three<00:02:06.400> the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
- and just will be luck number three the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.340 
- and just will be luck number three the
reason<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.730> use<00:02:07.880> those<00:02:08.090> beads<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.930> that<00:02:09.140> when<00:02:09.259> we

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
reason I use those beads is that when we

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.320 
reason I use those beads is that when we
hook<00:02:09.500> up<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> fish<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.850> two<00:02:11.030> hooks<00:02:11.240> pulled

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
hook up on a fish the two hooks pulled

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.380 
hook up on a fish the two hooks pulled
together<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.380> beads<00:02:12.670> actually<00:02:13.670> stop<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
together the beads actually stop the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.120 
together the beads actually stop the
hooks<00:02:14.570> from<00:02:14.690> pulling<00:02:14.990> together<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.650> increase

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
hooks from pulling together and increase

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.030 
hooks from pulling together and increase
the<00:02:16.520> amount<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> fish<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.060> get<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.360> boat<00:02:17.540> I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the amount of fish you get to the boat I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.160 
the amount of fish you get to the boat I
put<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.190> put<00:02:19.490> my<00:02:19.640> line<00:02:19.880> through<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> end<00:02:20.930> of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
put in put my line through the end of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.530 
put in put my line through the end of
the<00:02:21.860> hole<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> end<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.610> tail<00:02:22.820> which

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
the hole in the end of the tail which

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.590 
the hole in the end of the tail which
brings<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.900> out<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.170> other<00:02:24.290> end<00:02:25.060> then<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.270> tie

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
brings it out the other end then I tie

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.740 
brings it out the other end then I tie
on<00:02:26.750> my<00:02:26.930> smaller<00:02:27.290> hook<00:02:28.060> don't<00:02:29.060> put<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.300> larger

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
on my smaller hook don't put a larger

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.300 
on my smaller hook don't put a larger
hook<00:02:29.900> at<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> back<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.770> prawn<00:02:30.980> star

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
hook at the back of the prawn star

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.920 
hook at the back of the prawn star
because<00:02:31.940> then<00:02:32.150> it'll<00:02:32.330> start<00:02:32.570> getting<00:02:32.660> hooked

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
because then it'll start getting hooked

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.230 
because then it'll start getting hooked
up<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:33.890> said<00:02:33.920> most<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.550> your<00:02:34.790> hookups<00:02:35.090> on

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
up like I said most of your hookups on

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.380 
up like I said most of your hookups on
your<00:02:35.360> fish<00:02:35.570> or<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.350> your<00:02:36.440> middle<00:02:36.590> hook<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:38.300> we

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
your fish or on your middle hook so we

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.780 
your fish or on your middle hook so we
just<00:02:38.570> tie<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> standard<00:02:39.290> knot<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.550> tail

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
just tie a standard knot on the tail

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:53.110 
just tie a standard knot on the tail
hook

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.309 

and<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.629> pull<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:55.190> into<00:02:56.120> our<00:02:56.239> OnStar<00:02:59.319> push

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
and we pull that into our OnStar push

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.960 
and we pull that into our OnStar push
the<00:03:00.470> tail<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:02.410> clips<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.590> very<00:03:03.830> nicely<00:03:04.069> and
