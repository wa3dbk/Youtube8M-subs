00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.090
 refreshing caipirinha lemonade 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.240
 stir a bit and in cologne already 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.820
 suffice 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.890
 At the sight you get really thirsty 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.860

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:54.909
 Yummy it is really delicious 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.500
 Let's go with something sweet and grape 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.430
 to do that, I mix some mark one 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.369
 vanilla pods in natural yoghurt snap 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.320
 me a grape piss like me 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.929
 I have such long pikes here 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.640
 course in germany long and then 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.180
 I just look at yogurt 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.890
 and then into the deep then 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.000
 Repeat a few more times and then 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.830
 you can do it all in the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.709
 give freezer and that's great 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.080
 yummy crisp fresh sweet but 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.900
 still healthy then what ever more or 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.200
 from sweet to hearty to delicious 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.540
 buns I have a normal one 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.489
 pawn dolls made like the go white 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.200
 I guess everyone thinks of the recipe 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.910
 or you can find all the recipes of course 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.810
 on my blog there necessarily 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.280
 drop by 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.260
 There were four pancakes and the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.330
 let cool down first 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.070
 you can cool it down 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.630
 prove that you like me 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.400
 have now taken only fresh cheese 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.160
 and the franc completely with it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.470
 deleted then of course good pepper 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.299
 and do not season salt pepper too little 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.670
 otherwise just boring without luck 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.380
 tastes nothing then I have you salmon 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.660
 given over and for are fresh 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.579
 kick some green onions on it 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.739
 and that was just then one 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.320
 role for the second variant I have 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.630
 pesto coated and then easy 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.880
 bunched tomatoes laid over it too 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.040
 Roll again and that's it 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.390
 then in the fridge first then can 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.130
 you cut the better and that 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.680
 I start in the middle as well as sushi 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.560
 rolls and then just continue 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.570
 I always get six cut 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.090
 roll out of a punk and that again 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.230
 on spears with your flanks wants the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.450
 Of course you can also join one 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.450
 typical for a bit 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.019
 joke for your party otherwise it was 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.070
 beautiful 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.070
