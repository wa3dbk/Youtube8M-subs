00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello i am hardy and that is mine 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
 dance partner Sarah and we had planned 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.769
 a few days a nice intermediate 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.210
 Figure made in the classroom in the coma 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.549
 and I would like to meet him 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.890
 go through and give some tips 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.980
 Maybe you have this figure to dance 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.210
 you like I start the video to the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.210
 This through me step by step 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.180
 other 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:01:02.430
 okay I'm doing time on a slow motion 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.680
 turn normal right and then 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.890
 what happens in the cross that we do 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.049
 women overtake 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 very surprising for the women and us 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.860
 have to take care of a few things 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.460
 that the woman does not turn before 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 and in two sang the first thing 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 that is our feet with the 6 and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.750
 with the seven specifically with the 7 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:38.970
 this foot next to the women are yes 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.360
 that we're in the 123 that's coming soon 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.259
 but her left arm will get the same 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:55.109
 important is the six before that yes me 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:02:03.359
 I'm back so I'll do it here 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:09.630
 that's the 123 the five already and now 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:12.299
 a relatively large 66 that we on one 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.160
 line more or less lead more because 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.120
 we're going to get one one two three really 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.070
 quickly have to go to the other side 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:29.069
 I 'll go on this is the 66 and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.670
 the seven as I said on theirs 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.220
 height 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.079
 yes, that's very important 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.230
 second thing is that we are poor 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:43.290
 take up relatively late 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.170
 at this height and not now 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.280
 start up quickly, otherwise think like 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.650
 women maybe it's a different one 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.510
 This should really be very late 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.510
 in the 67 just happened 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:03.030
 here 56 and the 7 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.200
 and this just took off and with it 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.319
 the other hand with the right hand 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.180
 we do not see them now 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:15.989
 her waist and now go with the 12 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.819
 31 well of course the once could now 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.359
 be a little smaller here 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:29.760
 he should be a bit here a bit 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:35.400
 a bit smaller ops again from 12 356 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:40.319
 and the seven and now the 1 now the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.189
 2 and the three should be next to the women 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.409
 come now 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.569
 3 and that's really very, really 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:50.099
 very fast 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:51.829
 Simultaneously with the 3 should be your hand 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.030
 be taken 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.599
 I 'll do this case 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:07.470
 this hand on the 3 and now lead 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:08.810
 We follow the women with the right hand 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.099
 in the back and that is really very 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.199
 run fast because the woman of course 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:20.690
 always thinking it's long here but in 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:24.060
 this case for the women backwards 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.440
 and we do that with the right hand 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.919
 and accompanies everything with the course 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.720
 upper hand up here 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.990
 well it should actually be there 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.740
 again on clear and now 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.099
 Games I was ahead and the women 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.080
 Start now at the three already 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:51.500
 to set the direction and now catch the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.500
 turning women into 5 within the five 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.860
 556 and we'll leave the women first 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.490
 rotate 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.729
 6 and 7 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.069
 now 7 we have to love on the 7th 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.099
 men are not yet rom 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.840
 that's not important yet 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.719
 the feet are now to another 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.900
 page 7 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:26.050
 and now only the 1 first to the once 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:28.060
 Ms and the Elbe are close to the body 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:37.020
 it's our turn otherwise there is always a child 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:37.020
 hook make the 1 league 23 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.020
 there is now a second part 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.919
 but I wanted this first now 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.610
 first part to talk to you 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:59.020
 and yes I hope you like it 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.819
 as well as the presentation is and completely 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.969
 like to leave a comment about it 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.669
 I almost heard we already plan 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.440
 soon this is a chain me and we 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.569
 will be in this scheme soon 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:19.409
 with multiple chambers camera angles 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:19.409
 show and that is a variant 2 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:39.530
 12 456 lines through 125 56 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.530
 have lots of fun with it
