well<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.979> depends<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.820> easiest<00:01:27.330> way<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
well it depends the easiest way to do it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.420 
well it depends the easiest way to do it
is<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> take<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> scotch<00:01:28.500> brite<00:01:28.770> pad<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.189> water

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
is to take a scotch brite pad in water

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
is to take a scotch brite pad in water
and<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.240> scrub<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:30.960> bit

very outside coating off other than that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.719 
very outside coating off other than that
you're<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.479> what's<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
you're good to go and what's the

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.399 
you're good to go and what's the
antifouling<00:01:38.750> technology<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:39.960> used<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
antifouling technology that's used here

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.069 
antifouling technology that's used here
well<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.860> does<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> cuprous<00:01:41.700> oxide<00:01:42.180> it's

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
well it does use the cuprous oxide it's

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.719 
well it does use the cuprous oxide it's
an<00:01:43.259> ablative<00:01:43.619> product<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
an ablative product that we get to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.639 
an ablative product that we get to
control<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.570> amount<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> cuprous<00:01:46.229> oxide

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
control the amount of cuprous oxide

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.190 
control the amount of cuprous oxide
that's<00:01:46.860> released<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:48.659> green<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's released so it's very green that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
that's released so it's very green that
