explain<00:00:04.180> to<00:00:04.359> you<00:00:04.450> this<00:00:04.600> is<00:00:04.750> the<00:00:04.870> S<00:00:05.250> version<00:00:06.250> of

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:06.399 
explain to you this is the S version of

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.610 
explain to you this is the S version of
the<00:00:06.850> car<00:00:07.029> you<00:00:07.180> drove<00:00:07.420> and<00:00:07.809> the<00:00:07.990> S<00:00:08.080> means<00:00:08.320> that

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
the car you drove and the S means that

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.220 
the car you drove and the S means that
you<00:00:08.679> get<00:00:08.830> 40<00:00:09.280> more<00:00:09.429> horsepower<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:10.630> a

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
you get 40 more horsepower and a

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.020 
you get 40 more horsepower and a
mechanical<00:00:11.769> limited<00:00:12.190> slip<00:00:12.340> differential<00:00:12.910> it

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
mechanical limited slip differential it

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.030 
mechanical limited slip differential it
gives<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.330> car<00:00:13.510> a<00:00:13.570> bit<00:00:13.600> more<00:00:13.870> traction<00:00:14.170> most

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
gives the car a bit more traction most

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.700 
gives the car a bit more traction most
importantly<00:00:15.610> though<00:00:15.930> you<00:00:16.930> get<00:00:17.109> the<00:00:17.230> dynamic

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
importantly though you get the dynamic

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.540 
importantly though you get the dynamic
mode<00:00:18.189> which<00:00:18.880> on<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:20.500> when<00:00:20.680> you<00:00:20.800> set<00:00:21.039> dynamic

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
mode which on here when you set dynamic

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.689 
mode which on here when you set dynamic
on<00:00:22.510> this<00:00:22.869> button<00:00:23.140> here<00:00:23.260> yeah<00:00:23.860> you<00:00:24.190> can<00:00:24.369> go<00:00:24.520> for

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
on this button here yeah you can go for

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.590 
on this button here yeah you can go for
extra<00:00:25.000> features<00:00:25.390> don't<00:00:26.350> ma<00:00:26.590> Chi<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:28.060> when<00:00:28.480> it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
extra features don't ma Chi then when it

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.990 
extra features don't ma Chi then when it
goes<00:00:28.720> into<00:00:28.930> dynamic<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:30.160> sets<00:00:30.520> the<00:00:30.699> engine

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
goes into dynamic it sets the engine

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.540 
goes into dynamic it sets the engine
response<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.750> maximum<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:33.070> puts<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.460> little

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
response to the maximum it puts a little

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.490 
response to the maximum it puts a little
bit<00:00:33.699> more<00:00:33.969> weight<00:00:34.180> into<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.570> steering<00:00:35.140> so<00:00:35.410> you

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
bit more weight into the steering so you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.950 
bit more weight into the steering so you
what<00:00:35.649> more<00:00:35.770> feel<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.970> sets<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.480> adjustable

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
what more feel it sets the adjustable

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.639 
what more feel it sets the adjustable
suspension<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.710> fall<00:00:38.950> hard<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.960> maximizes

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
suspension to fall hard and it maximizes

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.100 
suspension to fall hard and it maximizes
the<00:00:42.040> speed<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.550> gear<00:00:42.700> shifts<00:00:43.120> okay<00:00:43.660> now<00:00:43.840> on

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
the speed of the gear shifts okay now on

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.950 
the speed of the gear shifts okay now on
the<00:00:44.590> road<00:00:44.800> probably<00:00:45.730> you'd<00:00:46.270> find<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:46.750> the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
the road probably you'd find that the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.160 
the road probably you'd find that the
hard<00:00:47.559> suspension<00:00:48.250> was<00:00:48.370> too<00:00:48.579> hard<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:49.960> can

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
hard suspension was too hard so you can

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.170 
hard suspension was too hard so you can
deselect<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.190> effect<00:00:51.730> if<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.879> have<00:00:52.000> my

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
deselect that and effect if you have my

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.030 
deselect that and effect if you have my
setup<00:00:52.629> you<00:00:52.809> might<00:00:53.020> want<00:00:53.230> lighter<00:00:53.440> steering

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
setup you might want lighter steering

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.190 
setup you might want lighter steering
but<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:54.910> might<00:00:55.090> like<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.450> engine<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.110> the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
but you might like the engine and the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.529 
but you might like the engine and the
gearshift<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.800> still<00:00:57.010> be<00:00:57.129> responsive<00:00:57.760> but<00:00:58.270> for

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
gearshift to still be responsive but for

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.770 
gearshift to still be responsive but for
the<00:00:58.660> track<00:00:58.930> we're<00:00:59.800> going<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.010> use<00:01:00.780> everything

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
the track we're going to use everything

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.779 
the track we're going to use everything
to<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.140> max<00:01:02.350> so<00:01:02.949> in<00:01:03.070> fact<00:01:03.309> though<00:01:03.460> he<00:01:03.579> said

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
to the max so in fact though he said

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.880 
to the max so in fact though he said
that<00:01:03.940> means<00:01:04.269> it<00:01:04.719> means<00:01:04.869> everybody's<00:01:05.619> on<00:01:05.829> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
that means it means everybody's on the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.819 
that means it means everybody's on the
max<00:01:06.100> okay<00:01:06.399> okay<00:01:07.119> okay<00:01:07.749> here<00:01:08.499> we<00:01:08.619> have<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.410 
sport shift yeah
in<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:11.109> mode<00:01:11.439> it's<00:01:11.920> in<00:01:12.069> automatic<00:01:12.189> yeah<00:01:13.090> if

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
in this mode it's in automatic yeah if

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.569 
in this mode it's in automatic yeah if
we<00:01:13.779> push<00:01:13.990> across<00:01:14.139> to<00:01:14.529> here<00:01:14.829> it<00:01:15.069> goes<00:01:15.279> into

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
we push across to here it goes into

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.480 
we push across to here it goes into
sport<00:01:15.939> mode<00:01:16.029> yeah<00:01:16.659> shift<00:01:16.959> mode<00:01:17.229> now<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.310> that

mode as we drive out of the pit lane it

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.099 
mode as we drive out of the pit lane it
will<00:01:20.709> be<00:01:20.829> automatic<00:01:21.459> but<00:01:21.639> as<00:01:22.569> soon<00:01:22.869> as<00:01:22.990> you

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
will be automatic but as soon as you

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.410 
will be automatic but as soon as you
intervene<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.920> either<00:01:24.399> change<00:01:24.789> gears<00:01:25.149> up

intervene and either change gears up

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.760 
intervene and either change gears up
shift<00:01:25.840> downshift<00:01:26.590> or<00:01:27.479> sequentially<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.619> will

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
shift downshift or sequentially it will

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.519 
shift downshift or sequentially it will
go<00:01:29.859> into<00:01:30.009> manual<00:01:30.369> mode<00:01:30.459> and<00:01:30.909> stay<00:01:31.479> there<00:01:31.779> in

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:32.529 
go into manual mode and stay there in

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.059 
go into manual mode and stay there in
the<00:01:33.039> middle<00:01:33.279> of<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.459> dash<00:01:33.669> here<00:01:33.939> will<00:01:34.359> be<00:01:34.630> a

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
the middle of the dash here will be a

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.379 
the middle of the dash here will be a
symbol<00:01:36.069> that<00:01:36.399> says<00:01:36.579> which<00:01:36.819> gear<00:01:37.060> you're<00:01:37.359> in

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
symbol that says which gear you're in

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.620 
symbol that says which gear you're in
okay<00:01:38.229> if<00:01:39.099> you<00:01:39.340> want<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.700> go<00:01:39.819> back<00:01:40.029> to<00:01:40.179> auto<00:01:40.359> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
okay if you want to go back to auto the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.539 
okay if you want to go back to auto the
quickest<00:01:41.200> way<00:01:41.349> is<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.740> hold<00:01:41.889> that<00:01:42.130> lever<00:01:42.369> back

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
quickest way is to hold that lever back

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.699 
quickest way is to hold that lever back
for<00:01:42.909> two<00:01:43.060> seconds<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.380> it'll<00:01:44.529> go<00:01:44.679> back

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
for two seconds and then it'll go back

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.979 
for two seconds and then it'll go back
to<00:01:45.009> automatic<00:01:45.279> okay<00:01:46.179> perfect

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:46.989 
to automatic okay perfect

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:48.449 
to automatic okay perfect
now<00:01:47.349> with<00:01:47.499> this<00:01:47.679> we're<00:01:47.919> going<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.099> take<00:01:48.189> you

now with this we're going to take you
for<00:01:48.729> one<00:01:49.029> reasonably<00:01:49.569> slow<00:01:49.810> lap<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.319> show<00:01:50.499> you

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
for one reasonably slow lap to show you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.709 
for one reasonably slow lap to show you
all<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:50.950> lines<00:01:51.159> then<00:01:52.029> I'll<00:01:52.179> take<00:01:52.389> you<00:01:52.509> for<00:01:52.659> a

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
all the lines then I'll take you for a

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.780 
all the lines then I'll take you for a
slightly<00:01:53.139> quicker<00:01:53.349> map

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
slightly quicker map

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.850 
slightly quicker map
well<00:01:55.270> then<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:55.540> your<00:01:55.570> turn<00:01:55.990> perfect<00:01:56.590> okay
