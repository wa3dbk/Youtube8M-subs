00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
for jumping and stuff and if you do have
a<00:01:11.610> broken<00:01:11.790> skid<00:01:12.150> plate<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.960> do

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
a broken skid plate which I do

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.280 
a broken skid plate which I do
I<00:01:13.380> wouldn't<00:01:13.799> recommend<00:01:13.920> jumping<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.290> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
I wouldn't recommend jumping with it you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
I wouldn't recommend jumping with it you
shouldn't<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> driving<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> truck<00:01:17.549> but

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
shouldn't even be driving the truck but

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
shouldn't even be driving the truck but
if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.900> need<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> drive<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> truck<00:01:19.920> don't

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
if you need to drive the truck don't

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.719 
if you need to drive the truck don't
jump<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.049> skid<00:01:22.380> plate

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
jump it because that skid plate

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.420 
jump it because that skid plate
reinforces<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.759> whole<00:01:24.270> chassis<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:26.189> drive

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
reinforces that whole chassis to drive

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.280 
reinforces that whole chassis to drive
shaft<00:01:26.729> connection<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> land<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
shaft connection so if you land on that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
shaft connection so if you land on that
front<00:01:28.710> wheel<00:01:28.890> wrong<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.909> whole<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
front wheel wrong that whole thing is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.170 
front wheel wrong that whole thing is
probably<00:01:30.630> gonna<00:01:30.900> come<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.439> break<00:01:32.180> because

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
probably gonna come up and break because

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
probably gonna come up and break because
I<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:33.780> recommend<00:01:33.900> jumping<00:01:34.500> the

they were telling for yeah throw one on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.630 
they were telling for yeah throw one on
there<00:02:16.020> it's<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.590> gonna<00:02:16.770> help<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.430> motor

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
there it's it's gonna help the motor

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.050 
there it's it's gonna help the motor
then<00:02:18.150> it'll<00:02:18.810> perform<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.170> lot<00:02:19.320> better<00:02:20.060> motor

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
then it'll perform a lot better motor

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.320 
then it'll perform a lot better motor
one<00:02:21.270> over<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.840> much<00:02:22.020> obviously<00:02:22.560> yeah<00:02:23.400> ok

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
one over here as much obviously yeah ok

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.880 
one over here as much obviously yeah ok
another<00:02:24.600> upgrade<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> can't<00:02:25.470> stress<00:02:25.680> this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
another upgrade and I can't stress this

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.770 
another upgrade and I can't stress this
one<00:02:26.100> enough<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:27.300> shocks

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
one enough the shocks

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.350 
one enough the shocks
ok<00:02:28.080> when<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.830> buy<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.070> car<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:30.120> comes

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
ok when you buy the car the it comes

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.210 
ok when you buy the car the it comes
with<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.840> already<00:02:31.020> comes<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.440> shocks<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
with it already comes with shocks on the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.670 
with it already comes with shocks on the
springs<00:02:33.170> my<00:02:34.170> opinion<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.070> terrible<00:02:35.520> shocks

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
springs my opinion the terrible shocks

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.050 
springs my opinion the terrible shocks
obviously<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.890> gets<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.400> job<00:02:38.610> done<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
obviously it gets the job done the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540 
obviously it gets the job done the
shocks<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.960> lot<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.950> car<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
shocks but a lot of the time the car the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.760 
shocks but a lot of the time the car the
car<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:42.510> uneven<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:43.320> its<00:02:43.530> weight

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
car is very uneven with its weight

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.520 
car is very uneven with its weight
distribution<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:45.450> shocks<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.020> come<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.410> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
distribution the shocks that come on it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.140 
distribution the shocks that come on it
they<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.980> they<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.400> equal<00:02:47.580> strength

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
they have that they have equal strength

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.830 
they have that they have equal strength
like<00:02:48.630> they're<00:02:48.810> equal<00:02:49.910> one<00:02:50.910> shock<00:02:51.209> isn't<00:02:51.480> hard

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
like they're equal one shock isn't hard

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390 
like they're equal one shock isn't hard
of<00:02:52.020> squeezing<00:02:52.709> than<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.130> shock

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
of squeezing than the other shock

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.300 
of squeezing than the other shock
they're<00:02:53.610> all<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> same

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
they're all the same

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.699 
they're all the same
so<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.640> recommend<00:02:57.270> swapping<00:02:57.720> them<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:58.020> Traxxas

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
so I recommend swapping them out Traxxas

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.250 
so I recommend swapping them out Traxxas
does<00:02:59.010> thankfully<00:02:59.910> give<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.330> harder<00:03:01.020> shocks

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
does thankfully give you harder shocks

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.030 
does thankfully give you harder shocks
to<00:03:01.470> swap<00:03:01.680> out<00:03:02.090> blue<00:03:03.090> shocks<00:03:03.390> if<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.830> look

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to swap out blue shocks if you just look

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.080 
to swap out blue shocks if you just look
around<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.280> shop<00:03:05.459> there<00:03:05.670> should<00:03:05.790> be<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
around the shop there should be like a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.190 
around the shop there should be like a
blue<00:03:06.800> paint<00:03:07.820> mark<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.180> blue<00:03:09.600> shocks<00:03:09.900> go<00:03:10.140> on

maybe<00:03:46.350> even<00:03:46.709> an<00:03:46.830> inch<00:03:46.980> lower<00:03:47.190> than<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:47.670> now

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
maybe even an inch lower than it is now

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.720 
maybe even an inch lower than it is now
it<00:03:48.870> comes<00:03:49.140> up<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.470> lot<00:03:49.620> quicker<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:50.040> well<00:03:50.100> that's

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
it comes up a lot quicker as well that's

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.210 
it comes up a lot quicker as well that's
harder<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> bottom<00:03:51.420> out<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.799> if<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.010> put

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
harder to bottom out and if you put

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.400 
harder to bottom out and if you put
these<00:03:53.370> shocks<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.910> Plus<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.840> put<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.110> on<00:03:55.230> its

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
these shocks in Plus you put it on its

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.340 
these shocks in Plus you put it on its
maximum<00:03:55.920> ride<00:03:56.370> height<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:57.450> will<00:03:57.720> keep<00:03:58.170> a

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
maximum ride height it will keep a

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.920 
maximum ride height it will keep a
forage<00:03:58.709> ride<00:03:58.950> height<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.430> tried<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.750> not

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
forage ride height I tried it it's not

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.210 
forage ride height I tried it it's not
good<00:04:01.110> for<00:04:01.230> me<00:04:01.380> because<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.590> flips<00:04:01.950> way<00:04:02.160> too

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
good for me because it flips way too

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.850 
good for me because it flips way too
often<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.480> did<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.810> its<00:04:04.200> stock<00:04:04.560> ride

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
often so I just did it to its stock ride

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.070 
often so I just did it to its stock ride
height<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.269> new<00:04:06.390> Springs<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.870> and

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
height and for the new Springs in and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.100 
height and for the new Springs in and
it's<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.620> much<00:04:07.860> better

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
it's so much better

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.870 
it's so much better
besides<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.590> don't<00:04:10.920> think<00:04:11.400> there's<00:04:11.640> much

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
besides that I don't think there's much

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.170 
besides that I don't think there's much
more<00:04:12.239> of<00:04:13.220> an<00:04:14.220> upgrade<00:04:14.370> thing<00:04:14.730> going<00:04:14.940> along

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
more of an upgrade thing going along

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.490 
more of an upgrade thing going along
other<00:04:15.510> than<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.870> tracks<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.350> pretty

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
other than that tracks this is pretty

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.529 
other than that tracks this is pretty
much<00:04:16.620> nailed<00:04:16.919> everything

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
much nailed everything

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.740 
much nailed everything
but<00:04:19.229> yeah<00:04:19.379> as<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.430> aluminium<00:04:20.669> parts<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.509> can

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
but yeah as much aluminium parts you can

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.540 
but yeah as much aluminium parts you can
go<00:04:22.319> ahead<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.620> upgrade<00:04:22.740> them<00:04:23.129> because

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
go ahead and upgrade them because

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.670 
go ahead and upgrade them because
plastic<00:04:24.240> parts<00:04:24.479> will<00:04:24.660> break<00:04:27.259> and<00:04:28.259> yeah<00:04:28.470> that's

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
plastic parts will break and yeah that's

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.350 
plastic parts will break and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:28.710> much<00:04:28.889> it<00:04:28.979> guys<00:04:29.159> if<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:29.879> want<00:04:30.120> me<00:04:30.240> to

and I'm trying to run these batteries

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.490 
and I'm trying to run these batteries
out<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.639> can<00:04:41.879> get<00:04:42.060> another<00:04:42.300> speed<00:04:42.780> another

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
out so I can get another speed another

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
speed video and because I was watching

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.469 
speed video and because I was watching
other<00:04:47.520> videos<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.940> people<00:04:48.150> are<00:04:48.270> getting<00:04:48.360> a

other videos and people are getting a

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.379 
other videos and people are getting a
lot<00:04:48.690> faster<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.139> these<00:04:49.289> things<00:04:49.470> on<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.520> too<00:04:51.210> so

lot faster on these things on to too so
so<00:04:52.080> I'm<00:04:52.349> gonna<00:04:52.440> try<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.680> run<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:52.919> bachelors

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
so I'm gonna try and run this bachelors

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.010 
so I'm gonna try and run this bachelors
out<00:04:53.370> charge<00:04:53.759> a<00:04:53.909> lot<00:04:54.060> fully<00:04:54.360> against<00:04:54.690> trapped

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
out charge a lot fully against trapped

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.510 
out charge a lot fully against trapped
in<00:04:55.139> that<00:04:55.169> mirror<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.590> go<00:04:56.039> again

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
in that mirror and go again

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.210 
in that mirror and go again
hopefully<00:04:57.360> we'll<00:04:57.630> pass<00:04:57.810> this<00:04:57.990> time<00:04:58.220> none

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
hopefully we'll pass this time none

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.890 
hopefully we'll pass this time none
