on this side as well this player stands
in<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> perfect<00:00:51.120> triangle<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> the

in a perfect triangle to be in the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
in a perfect triangle to be in the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
perfect place to catch the ball now you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
perfect place to catch the ball now you
can<00:00:54.930> catch<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.500> places<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> could

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
can catch at other places and you could

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
can catch at other places and you could
say<00:00:56.640> well<00:00:56.850> what's<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.270> bad<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.539> catching<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
say well what's so bad about catching it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
say well what's so bad about catching it
here<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.640> better<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.270> catch<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
here but it's better to catch it in a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
here but it's better to catch it in a
perfect<00:01:01.050> triangle<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> reasons<00:01:02.460> for

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
perfect triangle and the reasons for

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
perfect triangle and the reasons for
that<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.850> become<00:01:03.149> obvious<00:01:03.359> shortly<00:01:04.080> let's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that will become obvious shortly let's

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.740 
that will become obvious shortly let's
say<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> ball<00:01:05.670> suddenly<00:01:06.180> went<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
say that the ball suddenly went to the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.469 
say that the ball suddenly went to the
side<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.799> person<00:01:08.189> engaged<00:01:08.610> two<00:01:09.030> people

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
side and this person engaged two people

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
side and this person engaged two people
now<00:01:10.229> where's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.740> perfect<00:01:11.159> triangle<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
now where's a perfect triangle to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.340 
now where's a perfect triangle to
receive<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> ball<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> person

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
receive the ball for this person

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
receive the ball for this person
adjacent<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> ball<00:01:14.310> perfect<00:01:14.820> triangle

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
adjacent to the ball perfect triangle

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
adjacent to the ball perfect triangle
would<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.810> two<00:01:16.049> defenders<00:01:16.500> right

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
would be with these two defenders right

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
would be with these two defenders right
here<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.630> remained

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
here if this is the way they remained

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
here if this is the way they remained
right<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> perfect<00:01:20.880> triangle<00:01:21.299> on

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
right here then a perfect triangle on

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
right here then a perfect triangle on
this<00:01:21.720> side<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> that's

perfect<00:01:45.030> place<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> receive<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> pass<00:01:46.229> are

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
perfect place to receive a pass are

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
perfect place to receive a pass are
always<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> perfect<00:01:47.759> triangle<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
always in a perfect triangle with the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
always in a perfect triangle with the
nearest<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:49.200> defenders<00:01:49.799> let's<00:01:50.460> show<00:01:50.640> what

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
nearest two defenders let's show what

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
nearest two defenders let's show what
that<00:01:50.820> looks<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> court<00:01:51.899> let's<00:01:52.530> say

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that looks like on the court let's say

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.319 
that looks like on the court let's say
for<00:01:52.890> example<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> ball<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.790> being<00:01:53.909> dribbled

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
for example the ball is being dribbled

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
for example the ball is being dribbled
down<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.630> court<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.470> gets<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> there's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
down the court it gets here and there's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.880 
down the court it gets here and there's
two<00:01:56.939> people<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.600> their<00:01:57.750> zone<00:01:57.930> take<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> ball

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
two people in their zone take the ball

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
two people in their zone take the ball
so<00:01:59.579> let's<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.939> leave<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.329> ball<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so let's just leave the ball here you

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.719 
so let's just leave the ball here you
can<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.409> there'd<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.740> two<00:02:01.950> defenders<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
can see there'd be two defenders on the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.480 
can see there'd be two defenders on the
ball<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.810> person<00:02:04.290> immediately<00:02:04.399> adjacent<00:02:05.399> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
ball the person immediately adjacent on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
ball the person immediately adjacent on
the<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:05.790> has<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> decide<00:02:06.869> where's<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> best

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the right has to decide where's the best

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.529 
the right has to decide where's the best
place<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.740> stand<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.849> wouldn't<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> good

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
place to stand this wouldn't be a good

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
place to stand this wouldn't be a good
place<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.739> way<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.310> what's<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> perfect

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
place the way to know what's the perfect

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.300 
place the way to know what's the perfect
place

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
place

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.000 
place
that<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.420> two<00:02:14.660> defenders<00:02:15.170> how<00:02:15.500> far<00:02:15.770> they

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
that there is two defenders how far they

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.370 
that there is two defenders how far they
apart<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:17.270> case<00:02:17.510> they<00:02:17.690> look<00:02:17.840> about<00:02:18.080> six

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
apart in this case they look about six

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
apart in this case they look about six
feet<00:02:18.560> apart<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> want<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.819> be<00:02:19.910> six<00:02:20.239> feet<00:02:20.330> from
