00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.840
 Attack 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.970
 It is here to introduce this time 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.019
 Settler's 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.250
 long wallet 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:21.900
 Sound chip 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.240
 Well , it's the tallest wallet out of a settler 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.000
 It is the second line of whiter's cox 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.000
 Well located around 28,000 yen 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.760
 This is golden 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.290
 I wanted this cat to be white, but this was a little starting point 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.899
 Hey 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.260
 I don't like the colors that stand out 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.559
 If it is a wallet of about 30,000 , it is necessary to make money here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.300
 I thought it was all right to think or not it 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.829
 Is a short easy per fine surface scratches that 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.060
 Because it is full curl of cowhide 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.990
 Oh, this is the same as this, it's Setter's 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.890
 Suddenly when second folding 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:09.910
 Well this is also a pretty brunch, but it looks like this 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.600
 This is right with my nails and so on 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.390
 It's time to get it wrong 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.360
 Even though growth even without in that growth 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 It is a type that is damaged early and I think that it is better to be careful in handling 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.750
 Isn't it 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.340
 Well, in case of me don't worry about such a wound 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.840
 It will be taste, so if you are using it, use it for about a week 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.770
 It is in 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.030
 In this is this here quite easy to hold large 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.630
 Hmm 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.360
 It's good there, so I'm a man, so please point 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.840
 It was hard to open that afternoon and it's a small piece. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 This is fine 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.119
 I feel like I 'm not here I 'm not here but I often put a notice here Yes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.729
 I was not put today 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:07.390
 Somehow when well carry the notification but by far Tan now put a notice here 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:11.610
 Is good I have a four part say the bill in I'm spread pretty in such a feeling 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.300
 1234 something thousand yen bill is 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.990
 Enter here yes 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:24.480
 Dirt Well it is put here and the bill Man suit 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.430
 Yes Ya has been well today also contains fine gold Naa I do not know how well this Saifune thanks for the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.430
 I come in recently 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.400
 The real is I do for some reason known from then to this 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.940
 Enter it 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.350
 If so there is also a corresponding pocket here 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:44.810
 In addition I I I put a notice here is if there is a de 2 Choi 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.640
 In settler familiar mark coming I put the card to use at the time that the card here is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 It is written here 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.150
 this is 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:59.920
 But I think that character can not see me I am with the is written on that here Konosetora 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.760
 It is written in the place that contains prima facie the part of this card 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.650
 I don't want to show it, I don't want to pull out the curve 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.030
 Enter this 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:14.590
 Aso is n't that much about putting in and out cards 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:20.510
 It's not difficult to stand It 's just that the upper part gets stuck 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:26.450
 It's a bit of awkward when it comes out because it's a bit stuck here 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.040
 Well, normally there are only six cards, but there is a corresponding pocket for now, so it's money. 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.910
 I think that it is not necessary 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.550
 By the way for me I say 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:40.570
 I have another card to insert i I do not care because I usually carry around 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.360
 Point card or something and then I feel like this coin 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:48.080
 It is hard to use a little 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.080
 The reason is that it spreads out here, but it's surprisingly dark 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:59.450
 Why is it just the origin here? It's also money here, too Summer after all 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:03.860
 Now just gold Nde gold better luck or rather carry the corn good luck 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.920
 It seems to be the best to use gold for chuck because it is colored, but I still have a little 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.660
 Toka It is not a matter of taste are noticeable gold 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:18.900
 I'm thinking I just can't wait and use it 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:21.810
 I plan to use it for a long time, so this wallet is too large I used it before that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.870
 Guy of the Well of the round 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:30.409
 Bet that big feeling how much slightly larger 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.180
 This voice folded wallet goes inside 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.230
 Amazing size included 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:41.380
 Because it will be this 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:48.540
 Yes normally be there I will be closed chuck was put away full only person who is today 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.540
 Can you use it for small change like this and store the folded wallet itself 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.710
 Cage goods is unusual for you round to be placed in the wealth was 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:00.130
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.110

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.100
