00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 why 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello guys and girls how good of 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.340
 this video is going to show you my little box 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.130
 the month of March that have already 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.500
 moved everything inside I got the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.750
 last week I opened it was going to record a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.619
 video but I did not have time to record it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.780
 so he's going to teach you 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.450
 today 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.430
 came with all the products came in 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.680
 boxes and small bags but already what 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.220
 I have removed to make it faster for 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.200
 make it easier and when the box is 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.480
 this unlike the other boxes and 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.100
 They can usually be reused 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.180
 They are made of hard cardboard and have a lid and other 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.880
 these are softer and I think I do not know 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.520
 can they use again I do not know I think that 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.129
 in the end it would wear out before but good 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.379
 The body box is a new company too 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.420
 of the little boxes this new has 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.390
 a few months but it's new 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.429
 and the monthly subscription comes to 16 euros 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.829
 this is free 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.589
 They had a little box with me for Friday 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.600
 and they sent me for free and usually not 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.149
 I make videos of boxes but that's what 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.409
 I'm going to do it because it seems more 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.049
 interesting that it goes besides that has 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.570
 received are all products in size 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.659
 natural and I think it's pretty good 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.539
 this box itself was golden in 67 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.970
 with 93 euros that is quite so 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.500
 nothing if you want to know what my 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.500
 little box keep watching the video 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.810
 when I first show you that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.280
 comes a little box are these vials of 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.909
 candle are called video touch extra rich and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.899
 they are super is to structure the hair 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.630
 damaged moisturizes and renews everything 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.159
 others are biphasic I have not yet 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.899
 tried because I wanted to show you but 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.119
 well I think there are laws that are 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.360
 biphasic you're supposed to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.549
 move it to apply it on wet hair 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.130
 and then let it air dry 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.659
 drying with dryer rock machine no 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.250
 I will try because in the products of 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.849
 I really like them a lot and having and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.760
 good looking this way so good what 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.769
 I say this goes to 24 with 80 only this is 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.680
 has compensated the entire box really 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.209
 leaves 24 with 80 the next product that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.340
 I'm going to show you it's an enamel 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.040
 'seventeen' we add to each firm that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.519
 I do not know anything but the tone is very 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.739
 pretty so I'm looking forward to apply 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.970
 but especially because right now no 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.900
 are the nails 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.910
 says it will last five days of color not 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.520
 I know I have not tried yet but what 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.760
 you know from the blog this enamel costs 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.130
 four euros has more all the rest 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 another product that came digital I've 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.660
 tried because you know that I have a certain 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.670
 fixation or devotion for pasta 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.730
 teeth novels as I neither swallow them nor 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.720
 none of that but I really like the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.330
 teeth and when I have seen this saying 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.010
 then I have tried and I like me 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.709
 I like it a lot because it tastes good I do not know if 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.230
 blanc that does not have fluoride is a 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.080
 CAME fluoridated toothpaste for the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.020
 laboratories see cos 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.700
 it is rich it has a very rich taste then 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.709
 It is there when you finish the video goes to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.790
 bathroom and I will tell you another one that I have 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.120
 It is 25 milliliters and its price is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.310
 2.5 I think they are sold in pharmacies 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.200
 I know if you have already used it if you know 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.040
 what is what is to leave me here below for 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.060
 that I can buy it because 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.739
 at the same time polish in nothing fixed 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.799
 now another product that is like a 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.819
 first treatment is for before 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.640
 makeup but it also serves as 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:51.440
 treatment is this correction fluid 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.000
 for the skin is anti imperfections 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.299
 especially before and redness for 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.590
 Sensitive skin does not have fragrances or 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.930
 dyes is totally cold today 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.480
 has witch hazel extract as I have 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.730
 said without oil or perfume or perfumes 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.190
 and what it does is hydrate neutralized 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.530
 Reds and glitters softens and soothes 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.560
 skin 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.880
 seems to be very natural I did not know this 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.549
 signature is the witch if it can be which in 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.760
 this here did not know this signature and it 's 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.760
 a green product, I think that's why 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.190
 has that effect d 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.900
 to remove the redness and others I not only 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.190
 have the judges but well I 'm going to 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.620
 try because sometimes in certain times 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.330
 of the year yes they can get me out more has 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.800
 30 milliliters and it is also in size 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.600
 Normal natural size is worth another 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.460
 pilot that I'm going to teach is this 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.290
 illuminating pen that I have already 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.240
 used is from the snet if it's from the world 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.120
 stocks of lazy net is also a full 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.600
 saiz and its price of 18 euros you do not 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.820
 its price plus this goes to 15 with 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.250
 50 will happen and you 2 with five and the 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.890
 enamel four euros and that is not medical 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.780
 it's a bit illuminating like the toche 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.710
 tennis club and solana that yes nobody 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.710
 used 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.950
 the good thing about this 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.810
 is clear and I want to be monitored 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.870
 illuminate without having that touch of brightness 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.270
 on the skin without the skin looking like a 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.410
 tone I would appreciate with the particles of 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.090
 glitter that are carry two 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.060
 denominators this is to use it 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.410
 above makeup or by the area 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.110
 of the eyecup and also to give more light 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.150
 but this one is very clear to me but 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.130
 is to see this area a little bit 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.500
 more clarita without you see that you are 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.360
 product there I like I like your 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.270
 product site and usually uses it 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.940
 enough for everyday because it's like more 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.910
 fast and talgo last I saw is not what 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.540
 only that I did not like the little box 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:57.080
 is worth 495 is the beauty that packages 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.230
 I did not like it, it showed me 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.450
 I teach here is like this 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.660
 it reminded me of the pallets that are sold 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.940
 what have I done now in the hair 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.730
 in short, I remember better successes than 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.600
 they sell to small children that they 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.480
 sold in the Chinese bazaars is not 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.160
 a material that does not say anything either 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.350
 has a little mirror here the colors I do not know 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.110
 I know that I will not use them 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.200
 the best is very good or whatever it looks 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.730
 not even pepper I have not caught the 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.550
 fuchsia here is the one that called me the most and 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:39.169
 this is as if I want that's how it's like 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.180
 are left this then I do not know no 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.029
 I do not like it, I think that's a product 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.439
 more of the stuffing that they have put here 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.360
 I do not like it, surely they do not 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.219
 use in new and nieces no longer be 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.840
 here to give it to you so you can 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:56.210
 play but I'll give it to someone 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.130
 and that 's what I've taught all 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.960
 content of the chapel as you see has 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.010
 remained empty 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.130
 products that is very good for me 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.780
 paint from that box this here this 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.280
 to burn the redness because although I 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.670
 do not have it so make up people who 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.670
 if you have 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:17.110
 toothpaste and nail polish that 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.840
 I always like it a lot and the illuminator 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.360
 so nothing I told you that the box 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.520
 if it is valued at 67 with an increase of 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.280
 3 but the monthly subscription is 16 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.380
 euros if he lives like this every month with 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.970
 products that are new because here 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.780
 there is none of those products 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:36.550
 I have not tried and maybe I do not 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.050
 I dared to try them I do not know what comes 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.300
 well for knowing the subject of the boxes 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.500
 if you come and every month 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.840
 this has to start great so nothing 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.030
 comment my work is called you knew and 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.650
 what do you think we look like in the 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.340
 next video a little kiss better treated 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.340
 bye
