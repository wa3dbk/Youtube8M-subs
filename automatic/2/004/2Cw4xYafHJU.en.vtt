00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 two 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.110
 hi how about youtube friends i am 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.919
 the hacker 117 and this time I'm going to 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.599
 show them how to activate windows 7 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.020
 you realize that in this part 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.029
 from the lower right corner appears 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.510
 the ad where you are telling me here 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.850
 my copy of windows is not original 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.510
 then we have to put the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.650
 serial the code of windows 7 so that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.650
 can be activated and we are not 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.589
 bothering more this is very annoying 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.040
 so what we need to do to 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:52.100
 that this stops happening and to activate 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.090
 windows 7 need to download this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.770
 remote watch file 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.720
 I'm going to leave it in the links in the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.980
 description of the video 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.250
 They are one crumb downloaded once they go 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.590
 to leave this file unzip it and 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 they will have this 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.159
 Double click 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.159
 let's say that if we close this 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.299
 we wait for the program to open 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 in one you need installation very well the 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.500
 problem that arises when you do not activate 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.380
 windows 7 is that there is an update 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.720
 which is downloaded while it is running 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.659
 the system that is precisely the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 web installation and this program what 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.399
 will do is remove it because this 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 Update detects when the windows 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.770
 it is not original or the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 code and etcetera very well we give here 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.500
 remote boat 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.500
 let's accept 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920
 woking 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.920
 we wait 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.110
 a cmd window 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.110
 and it will restart us 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.130
 as they will realize, the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.280
 system and the warning has disappeared 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.160
 we have in this part has been uninstalled 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.069
 the update and we practically have 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.580
 activated our windows this too 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.450
 it's for windows 8 I already tried it 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.069
 And if it works 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.599
 I recommend you deactivate the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.959
 updates so you do not go back to 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.280
 download this and bother us again 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.680
 to do it we go to panel 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.640
 control 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.850
 security system windows update 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.410
 here I already have them disabled 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.540
 change default settings 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.940
 you are going to have it in this install 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.650
 updates automatically go to 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.160
 select the last one and do not search 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.140
 updates and they give you accept like this 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.580
 prevents it from being downloaded again 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.330
 update as I had already 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 mentioned 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.800
 and others that in fact most of the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.530
 precisions that are downloaded serve us 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.750
 no way 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.590
 and we avoid a long wait in front of 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.240
 monitor and we select our problem 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.140
 very well this has been all 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.319
 I am a hacker 117 subscribe give yourself 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.300
 like share and remember to comment 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.300
