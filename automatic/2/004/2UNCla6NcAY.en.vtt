00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.759
 hi everyone today shows a little one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 trick to have unlimited nancy e 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.099
 practically its plane for example vi 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.030
 I show 11,600 nonnis on mine 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.010
 account without having that trick 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.430
 enabled now what you need 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.580
 clearly a jailbroken device is 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.320
 a tweet called flex that's this one 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.530
 down 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 we open cydia and we will need some 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.090
 sources with the time we go into 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 sources and we should add the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 source byte your apple that link 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 report from the title is functional to this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.809
 dot let's go into the search and write flex 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.019
 we click flex 2 with the debate icon 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 rep 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 at that point when it will vary no on top a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.180
 right 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 there we will have to go to click on install 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.990
 and I don't really do it because I have it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.890
 already done so instead of stable me 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.890
 change appears 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.299
 at this point I have flex 2 will be 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.270
 a downloaded and installed one will appear 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.189
 new icon that is this one 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 we open the e to load here for 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.450
 see all the hacks you'll have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.630
 installed on the device 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.420
 in my case chapman just a miss 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 that is the flight to the nice 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 let's click on the clouds in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.689
 low and we click on upload a server 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.659
 craighead ok at this point we go 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.659
 look up hand then 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.090
 here they are all na na na all these 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.119
 here now I should have if not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.890
 I remember correctly this is not this 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.530
 however not all of them will work 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.680
 one hundred percent so maybe 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 you will choose one from the list that 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.519
 will do for you 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.860
 however to install it is a lot 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.930
 simple for example let's go to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.690
 select this which should be 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.150
 what I don't think this is 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.100
 however we click on the little cloud in 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.970
 top right those with the arrow and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.519
 it turns out that just the patch downloaded 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.290
 let's click on smith let's go in in 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.120
 lower left in the parts lists 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.819
 which we have now will appear to you as soon as 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.080
 the name of peace anyway have 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.260
 downloaded click on the check box here at 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.120
 right to enable it and to this 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 point let's close to plane now 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.329
 let's get back to it before we get back to it 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:10.070
 and you will see if the match is valid you will see 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.299
 that you have just 9 million nanas 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.970
 these ninth if you can clearly see them 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.359
 spend as I would like the example now 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.950
 I take not a good 10 and 7 euros 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:30.359
 but then I enter my name and click 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:32.280
 su convertÃ¬ ok ok they climbed in anas 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.709
 even if we won't see it because I am 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.850
 practically unlimited and in how much 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.250

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.720

 valid not induce some clashed 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.850
