decided<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> little<00:00:13.440> research<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.099> let's

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
decided to do a little research so let's

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.369 
decided to do a little research so let's
start<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> basics<00:00:15.690> why<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.230> need

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379

so this can become a challenge for
