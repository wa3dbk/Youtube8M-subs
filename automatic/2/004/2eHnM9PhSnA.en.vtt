 even whatever browser you have 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.660

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.380
 here you put toolkit 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.490
 you 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.490
 and the first 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.530
 tui kid 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.200
 you expect me to load 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.610
 is 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.470
 if you want the bottom part 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:08.060
 because not so much anymore that the point more for 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.049
 this becomes only downloads to the first 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.049
 you can download 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.040
 I do not know how shit to appear here 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.040
 you propose to save and save in desktop 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 if you do not know it was yew disque because I 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.659
 I have this leader we have not loaded 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.659
 discharge 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.789
 while there 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.789
 file that is downloaded you open it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.720
 in the folder 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.720
 you extract it on the desk 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.330
 to see that folder and delete what it says 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.620
 layers you delete erase delete and in 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.960
 others double click 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.950
 you do if you ask permission if 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.670
 one of 33 is healthy 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 with a load 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.720
 already in the studio will not load 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.700
 so it's not going to load 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.710
 the fear charges because it is configured 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.690
 that will not load 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.610
 already configured it is what you have to 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.570
 appear a little screen and in that 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.610
 stage search screen a little message 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.170
 the fights ok or assign I do not know what the fuck 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.850
 nor does a screen appear before you 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 look for the warcraft folder 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.460
 and to accept and just cover and is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.400
 saved you can be anywhere but 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.200
 but for this before what to do is 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.800
 not functional 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.330
 hence this is for inventories those 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.260
 squares to use this pp or a cure 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.010
 I dont know 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.530
 habitually I put 1 2 3 4 and 5 and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.629
 6 in custom taste that is to put w 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.030
 the gift that you want are the powers 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.670
 if you realize it is only a guide 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.390
 are not those those unique as you are is the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.920
 guide for all heroes 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.920
 that's how I put it 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:33.390
 but this way and here where jockey says are the 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.390
 two tachas and you put generate 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.420
 if it looks like that you're fucked 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.640
 but it must look like you're loading the mass if 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.550
 charge the touch but explain it so many 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.210
 sometimes yes 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.210
 to this lack 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.830
 I do not know, I wrote mom, she and CÃ¡diz and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.080
 setting setting after the last one if it's 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.270
 It does not look like you like that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.960
 if it appears the same you put where it says 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:17.220
 auto so read / resolution you put auto 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:21.230
 auto and it puts you if you accept you put course in 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.240
 case ideas are on the icon of warcraft 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.240
 the writer of warcraft 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.810
 you are already testing it if you want it is already 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.900
 everything now closes sixth you close the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.120
 warcraft iii and the toolkit will be here 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.220
 at the bottom like you have xp 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.930
 will be there suddenly in the part of 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.100
 down I do not know but it's a small icon that 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.440
 is in the lower right part 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.960
 it's an icon if you do not do anything right now 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.780
 and is active 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.430
 and between saccharin and enter the Bogota 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.430
 everyone is silent to take 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.680
 while making sand ideas and be 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.870

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.870
