Atari<00:06:33.870> it's<00:06:34.140> an<00:06:34.229> iconic<00:06:34.620> racing<00:06:35.190> game<00:06:35.370> when<00:06:35.790> I

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
Atari it's an iconic racing game when I

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.020 
Atari it's an iconic racing game when I
think<00:06:36.060> racing<00:06:36.419> games<00:06:36.600> like

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
think racing games like

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.120 
think racing games like
racing<00:06:37.480> games<00:06:37.690> this<00:06:37.930> is<00:06:37.990> certainly<00:06:38.350> one<00:06:38.650> and<00:06:39.070> I

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
racing games this is certainly one and I

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.680 
racing games this is certainly one and I
think<00:06:39.340> if<00:06:39.430> I<00:06:39.520> wasn't<00:06:39.730> spread<00:06:40.150> the<00:06:40.210> success<00:06:40.540> of

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
basically against the time clock but

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.320 
basically against the time clock but
