00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.630
 put boards like that after them 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.440
 boards where the boat is below 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.179
 we were two stairs later at 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.650
 above the stairs you moved from 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:20.830
 are like these and to activate them 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.100
