00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.550
 and what's up guys, how are we in the 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.620
 second channel again and good this 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.970
 dragon many people what has the channel 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.410
 in this case you can bring a tutorial 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.269
 quite interesting how to get 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.559
 the seven dragon balls that are very 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.959
 important this game as we can 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.519
 make a wish as you already know and we will 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.810
 come very well just do not 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.040
 they come to secondary missions without 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.930
 connection we can also do it with 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.790
 connection but good you can do it without 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.920
 connection no problem we present the 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.750
 first mission and we choose the 02 it's worth 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.090
 is preparing for the attack that jan then 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.170
 enter it once this is where 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.940
 that mission what we have to do is 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.649
 pass us the first part that will defeat 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.179
 to krillin tension and already wide if not 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.559
 I remember badly good here you can choose the 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.120
 character that you want your character 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.039
 one of the machine with your geral that 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.530
 it does not matter anymore and we have to pass 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.120
 the first part first thing this mission 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.440
 it does not always come out is to say what we have 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.659
 what to achieve is to defeat these three 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.979
 characters from the beginning and that we get 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.229
 a character to do a mission 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.760
 secondary is worth if that character does not 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.469
 we have done it well it is worth it if we do not have 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 than to repeat the mission but that 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.389
 you'll see that it takes nothing a minute 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.469
 in defeating these three characters worth 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.840
 once defeated these three characters 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.580
 as I say in these small portals that 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.800
 the clicks are encolumnan 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.600
 a character every time to see how I say no 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.920
 always comes out so when we get out 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.720
 you have to repeat the mission again 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.790
 of the ice star retry and give 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.140
 you try again worth advice with zoo 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.300
 and if your doll does not have much level 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.860
 in this case I have almost 50 level so 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.480
 it happened very fast if you do not have it 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.280
 you can fuck is a doll machine 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.990
 and it is already valid here as you are seeing 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.550
 what happened the first part and I get the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.290
 character is worth then let's talk 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.910
 with him if not no, if it does not come out as said 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 then we go back to repeat it without any 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.870
 problem we talk to him we fight with 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.330
 him and this is very important too 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.100
 when we fight against him he can 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.870
 give the dragonball or we can not 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.950
 give is to say if you do not give it to us we have 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.630
 to repeat again but I'm going to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.430
 teach how to know if you gave it or not 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.800
 yes, as you are seeing, we are going to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.570
 defeat and once defeated we will 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.760
 leave what objects has given us can 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.260
 give two normal objects that are some 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.780
 badges that can defend them by 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.040
 inside such or we can give the time of 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.510
 lake as I am seeing I have killed and 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.430
 bets get objects to combine 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.479
 this does not interest us and has returned to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.490
 get an object to combine 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.050
 So here we have failed because we do not 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.729
 has given us the ball then we will have 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.590
 to give to be again and re try 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.090
 again the mission is worth in this case I 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.560
 I'll put a video and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.700
 where I get it with my character that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.580
 you are seeing me I passed the first 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.129
 part fought against this passenger 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.560
 time you are watching it as I passed 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.900
 the first part as I say and already when 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.489
 we defeated her tells us that we have 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.530
 got the dragonball as you go to 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.049
 see now it is worth then and I tell you that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.120
 it's pretty easy to get them 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.590
 yes it is true that sometimes you lose 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.879
 a little while since it has to be 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.379
 all the time trying trying 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.330
 trying but once he gets it 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.260
 the ball is no problem as you see 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
 once you get it this is at 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.010
 key object there is when we already know 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.910
 that they have given us the dragonball and now 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.140
 all we have to do is 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.380
 finish the mission that we have to 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.150
 fight later against peak the someone and 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.860
 then against goku we finished the mission 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.870
 gives us the dragonball gives us also 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.879
 the infrequent object that good the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.260
 badge that can later be sold and 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.579
 nothing more guys like that we've got the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.049
 we can make a dragon ball 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.760
 lots of times to get seven 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.200
 since when we get the 7 we can 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.849
 ask for that wish that may be a wish 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.799
 of an ability to improve our 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.269
 character to get a character that 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.099
 You can not get normally is , 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.420
 normal in the game so they give us 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.530
 some things that are pretty cool 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.049
 it's worth it so nothing guys I hope you 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.220

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.400

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.940
 I say that I loved the game but 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.650
 I will try to explain a bit then what to give 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.650
 people who have doubts about whether to buy it 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.790
 it's not worth it so nothing boy is a pleasure
