the<00:00:11.410> first<00:00:11.680> shot<00:00:11.980> is<00:00:12.160> about<00:00:12.430> 2<00:00:12.730> inches<00:00:12.760> low<00:00:13.360> at

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
inches low at 75 yards so I think I need

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.850 
inches low at 75 yards so I think I need
to<00:00:33.910> come<00:00:34.149> up<00:00:34.180> quite<00:00:34.719> a<00:00:34.750> few<00:00:35.020> clicks<00:00:35.350> here<00:00:35.620> so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
to come up quite a few clicks here so

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.700 
to come up quite a few clicks here so
I'm<00:00:35.980> gonna<00:00:36.129> do<00:00:36.339> that<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.530> things

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
I'm gonna do that one of the things

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.169 
I'm gonna do that one of the things
you'll<00:00:38.890> notice<00:00:39.249> is<00:00:39.399> that<00:00:39.429> I'm<00:00:39.670> using<00:00:39.879> this

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
you'll notice is that I'm using this

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.439 
you'll notice is that I'm using this
rest<00:00:40.780> here<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.140> then<00:00:41.260> it'll<00:00:41.379> give<00:00:41.530> me<00:00:41.679> a<00:00:42.449> much

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
rest here and then it'll give me a much

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.579 
rest here and then it'll give me a much
steadier<00:00:44.109> for<00:00:44.469> shooting<00:00:45.370> position<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:47.469> I'm

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
steadier for shooting position what I'm

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.559 
steadier for shooting position what I'm
trying<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.100> do<00:00:48.249> when<00:00:48.399> I<00:00:48.429> sight<00:00:48.789> in<00:00:48.969> here<00:00:49.359> is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
trying to do when I sight in here is

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.869 
trying to do when I sight in here is
eliminate<00:00:50.319> as<00:00:50.440> much<00:00:50.649> wobble<00:00:50.949> as<00:00:51.219> possible

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
eliminate as much wobble as possible

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.020 
eliminate as much wobble as possible
eliminate<00:00:52.870> variables<00:00:53.469> you'll<00:00:54.280> probably<00:00:54.579> hear

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
eliminate variables you'll probably hear

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.279 
eliminate variables you'll probably hear
me<00:00:55.179> take<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.929> deep<00:00:56.620> breath<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.190> hold<00:00:58.179> it<00:00:58.420> and

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
me take a deep breath in hold it and

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.439 
me take a deep breath in hold it and
then<00:00:59.440> squeeze<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.249> trigger<00:01:00.489> it's<00:01:01.179> kind<00:01:01.390> of

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
then squeeze the trigger it's kind of

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.270 
then squeeze the trigger it's kind of
challenging<00:01:01.929> sometimes<00:01:02.170> with<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:02.679> shotgun<00:01:03.010> to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
challenging sometimes with a shotgun to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.140 
challenging sometimes with a shotgun to
squeeze<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.729> trigger

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
squeeze the trigger

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.920 
squeeze the trigger
this<00:01:04.659> 870<00:01:05.530> triggers<00:01:05.860> actually<00:01:06.340> not<00:01:06.580> too<00:01:06.880> bad

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this 870 triggers actually not too bad

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:30.910 
this 870 triggers actually not too bad
things<00:01:07.930> considered

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.109 

okay<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> hope<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
okay I hope you can see this here this

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.260 
okay I hope you can see this here this
is<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.720> target<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.940> shot

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
is the target that we have and that shot

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.500 
is the target that we have and that shot
that<00:01:36.780> shot<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.710> shot<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
that shot that shot that one and that

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.640 
that shot that shot that one and that
one<00:01:39.890> were<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> last<00:01:41.700> five<00:01:42.119> shots<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.900> know<00:01:43.260> for

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
one were the last five shots I know for

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.650 
one were the last five shots I know for
a<00:01:43.680> fact<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.160> squeeze<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> trigger<00:01:44.729> really

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
a fact that I squeeze the trigger really

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.410 
a fact that I squeeze the trigger really
well<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.830> shot<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.210> that's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
well on that shot and I think that's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
well on that shot and I think that's
just<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.869> plier<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
just a plier that I'm going to have to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
just a plier that I'm going to have to
accept<00:01:51.410> given<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.500> variability<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.190> this

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
accept given the variability of this

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
accept given the variability of this
particular<00:01:53.640> brand<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.119> ammunition<00:01:54.420> these

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
particular brand of ammunition these

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.950 
particular brand of ammunition these
ones<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.160> very<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.450> acceptable

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
ones are all very very acceptable

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.779 
ones are all very very acceptable
grouping<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:58.830> one<00:01:59.039> just<00:01:59.190> throws<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> in

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
grouping this one just throws it in

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.969 
grouping this one just throws it in
doubt<00:02:00.050> realistically<00:02:01.050> speaking<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.800> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
doubt realistically speaking with this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560 
doubt realistically speaking with this
target<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.430> seventy-five<00:02:03.000> yards<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.539> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
target at seventy-five yards and I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
target at seventy-five yards and I
certainly<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.110> want<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.560> ethnically<00:02:05.039> sure

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
certainly don't want to ethnically sure

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880 
certainly don't want to ethnically sure
that<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.550> near<00:02:05.820> beyond<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.390> business<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that a near beyond this business and to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.410 
that a near beyond this business and to
reduce<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.369> variability<00:02:08.640> keep<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.270> in

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
reduce the variability keep it in

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.290 
reduce the variability keep it in
towards<00:02:09.899> 50<00:02:10.320> yards<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.640> even<00:02:11.940> better

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
towards 50 yards would be even better

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.600 
towards 50 yards would be even better
so<00:02:12.780> that's<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> report<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.310> ammunition

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so that's the report for this ammunition

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.580 
so that's the report for this ammunition
we'll<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.360> what<00:02:15.510> happens<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.200> move<00:02:16.410> on

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
we'll see what happens when we move on

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.039 
we'll see what happens when we move on
to<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.830> next<00:02:17.040> brand<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.000> said<00:02:18.239> I'm<00:02:18.720> full

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
to the next brand like I said I'm full

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.190 
to the next brand like I said I'm full
within<00:02:19.290> 50<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.799> about<00:02:19.920> 75<00:02:20.489> yards<00:02:20.910> all<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.049> these

within 50 to about 75 yards all of these

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.590 
within 50 to about 75 yards all of these
shots<00:02:22.410> are<00:02:22.620> within<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.980> deer's<00:02:23.280> kill<00:02:23.670> zone<00:02:23.970> but

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
shots are within a deer's kill zone but

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.699 
shots are within a deer's kill zone but
I<00:02:24.630> wouldn't<00:02:24.989> want<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.230> push<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.470> beyond<00:02:25.680> that

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
I wouldn't want to push it beyond that

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.700 
I wouldn't want to push it beyond that
