00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
story emotionally it's just like people

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.500 
story emotionally it's just like people
die<00:03:41.620> stuff<00:03:42.220> blows<00:03:42.519> up<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.940> even<00:03:43.180> when<00:03:43.209> getting

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
emotion it just comes off as really

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.869 
emotion it just comes off as really
half-assed<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:48.220> gameplay<00:03:48.519> certainly

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
half-assed the gameplay certainly

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.250 
half-assed the gameplay certainly

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260

involvement<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.859> you<00:03:51.250> won't<00:03:51.489> find<00:03:51.790> much<00:03:52.030> to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
involvement and you won't find much to

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.729 
involvement and you won't find much to
grab<00:03:52.389> onto<00:03:52.569> with<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.930> presentation<00:03:53.349> either

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
grab onto with the presentation either

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.170 
grab onto with the presentation either
considering<00:03:54.310> all<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.519> weird<00:03:54.700> technical

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
considering all the weird technical

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.610 
issues and what-have-you evident rising
seems<00:03:57.639> like<00:03:57.940> it's<00:03:58.150> trying<00:03:58.480> really<00:03:59.049> hard<00:03:59.199> to<00:03:59.530> be

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
seems like it's trying really hard to be

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.349 
seems like it's trying really hard to be
something<00:04:00.010> new<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.400> different<00:04:00.730> ambitious<00:04:01.180> or

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
something new and different ambitious or

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.420 
something new and different ambitious or
whatever<00:04:01.930> but<00:04:02.470> even<00:04:02.739> though<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:02.949> game<00:04:03.099> seems

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
whatever but even though the game seems

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.640 
whatever but even though the game seems
that<00:04:03.699> way<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:04.090> game<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.989> actually<00:04:05.199> play

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
that way the game that you actually play

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.379 
that way the game that you actually play
doesn't<00:04:06.129> really<00:04:06.310> represent<00:04:06.639> any<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.329> that

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
doesn't really represent any of that

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.970 
doesn't really represent any of that
effort<00:04:07.599> it<00:04:07.900> just<00:04:08.049> feels<00:04:08.230> like<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> game<00:04:08.799> that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
effort it just feels like a game that

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.770 
effort it just feels like a game that
thinks<00:04:09.489> it's<00:04:09.669> a<00:04:09.819> whole<00:04:10.060> lot<00:04:10.209> better<00:04:10.239> than<00:04:10.569> it

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
thinks it's a whole lot better than it

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.750 
thinks it's a whole lot better than it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
really is so regardless as to whether

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.159 
really is so regardless as to whether
you<00:04:13.090> know<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.239> was<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:13.690> kind<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.959> lost

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
you know it was just kind of a lost

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.990 
you know it was just kind of a lost
cause<00:04:14.379> to<00:04:14.620> begin<00:04:14.889> with<00:04:15.099> or<00:04:15.370> if<00:04:15.639> it<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:15.760> needed

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
cause to begin with or if it just needed

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.270 
cause to begin with or if it just needed

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
more time in the pipes and rising feels

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.319 
more time in the pipes and rising feels
like<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.430> game<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:18.699> just<00:04:18.880> wasn't<00:04:19.000> finished

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329

advent rising type games but honestly I

advent rising type games but honestly I
