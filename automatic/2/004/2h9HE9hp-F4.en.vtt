00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.600
 Idiots of this week Idiots of this week are adults 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.269
 is 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.780
 Oh, it is a building to say adult 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.680
 It is something that has happened recently but I 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.770
 The way back to work is quite late 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.370
 It I was riding the train to slow time in a split 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.840
 It feels like a main train 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.370
 It wasn't so full at first when it was the first time it was wrong, but in the middle role 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.520
 A lot of people came in 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:42.710
 It became like a good guy, and then I was behind me 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 It is great, while the person is caught in the strap 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 It is fluttering, to me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.120
 It's coming to light I have a seat in that chair and I was sitting just in front of it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.950
 It's not like that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.600
 The man is amazing pounding length but that I was standing immediately witness 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.830
 I was hitting it and I was trying to make a difference though I thought it was a little annoying with my hand 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.760
 But of course that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:17.040
 Quite without reason to stick Zenkyu because Irassharu drunk to the people 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:21.360
 A little troubled man was in the next And then I that is mine but is tan in Gaano 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 I would like to replace the place, and he told me something like that. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.990
 Hey I was getting off at the next station, and it's also a crowded train so I could move 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 I think I'll take my eyes on other people, but I'm fine Thank you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.060
 But did I refuse And then to me to say that men should say at any time 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.659
 so 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:49.360
 I was able to get off soon after it was the next station, but when I got off that I 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:54.939
 Thank you very much to say to take care say the Once One of the men called out I just below 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.050
 And also I think I was giving me that if you think about it in by it amazing happy 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:02.780
 Have fairly or with the backpack Toka bag 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:09.710
 But I thought that there was n't so much people who are going to pick it up temporarily 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:15.920
 That of the people around or what amazing to have brought the seat principal and interest properly Luc person 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:17.040
 That sort of also Na amazing softening think I Do not wonder with cares because I have Mami 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.319
 I thought 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.980
 Well I'm so happy that I have to go home 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.939
 It was full of warm feelings and there I 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.659
 I can think of people around me like this 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:39.049
 I do not know at all without'm Toka that his acquaintance 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:41.310
 I thought that I wanted to become a possible adult who can also see other people 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.680
 I am fine while riding 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.130
 Another Once you open Tsu Na or not even open what number of times tired to global the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.760
 It is such yourself what if's and but I had wanted to direct, and they Na want will be taught 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.300
 I felt it was hard to see 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:01.050
 So if you're a little tired 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:07.770
 It's just because it's stuck openly, saying that it's open for others 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.940
 For example, if you let someone else sit down, you can afford the other person's room. 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.790
 I can think of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.099
 The so you want to be in the sky I thought really 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.099
 So I am an adult with two characters this week
