00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
a little loose I think it'd probably use

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.790 
a little loose I think it'd probably use
another<00:02:26.750> net<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.319> little<00:02:27.650> another<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:32.800> showing

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
another net a little another not showing

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.500 
another net a little another not showing
it<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.250> upside<00:02:34.520> answer<00:02:35.110> there<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.170> go

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
it to you upside answer there we go

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.380 
it to you upside answer there we go
it's<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.750> pretty<00:02:38.930> though<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.180> kind<00:02:44.360> of

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
it's so pretty though but it kind of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.810 
it's so pretty though but it kind of
turns<00:02:44.750> around<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.140> easy<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.800> me<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.670> think

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820
