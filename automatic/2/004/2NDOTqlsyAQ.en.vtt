00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 lets go 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.770
 false 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.240
 and we are here with toÃ±o April he has 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.990
 tell us how it went in Paraguay 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.650
 that was that story and as well already 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.320
 You came back how you did, because it was 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.400
 great I met a lot of people I made many 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.860
 good friends 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.099
 provides with the different slogans of the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.340
 enjoyed culture enjoyed a lot and 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.470
 I was also seriously compete bone I 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.870
 I think I left the Ecuador very high 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.440
 all the good people that were connected 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.650
 with a telephone channel on Saturdays and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.600
 Sundays they know and that those weights that what 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.210
 very high to leave Ecuador such the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.510
 competition from Ecuador versus the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.829
 Competition from Paraguay Hard Hard Hard 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.920
 the competition and I think they were 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.680
 tests of just seconds that there was 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.440
 difference between the one that was faster 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.010
 since it was called torito with me they were from 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.740
 2 to 3 seconds or little by little I was 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.320
 reaching and you left me only you were 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.240
 in the company of dina who is this 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 fellowship you think they joined more 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.619
 as partners and I think that always 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 had the support be like we were 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.460
 compatriots and you had to support us 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.980
 I think I had a little more 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.570
 experience that she shared all 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.190
 the experience I had in the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.250
 competences he shared he gave 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.210
 some tips to improve your 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.710
 quickness in her endurance and so much she 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.840
 like me I think we made a good 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.660
 paper there representing Ecuador not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 we are in perhaps the first 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.950
 but Ecuador knows that I was 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.590
 I tried my best maybe because of a theme 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.430
 I had to return but I arrived 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.310
 until the semifinal and I think Ecuador 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.250
 he left his representative well there in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 paraguay and people know about it from all 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.990
 7 paraguay street here is there 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.200
 very strong competitors comments to me that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.229
 was your injury as it happened today and that as 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.770
 you are now look I think that that has been 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.330
 a very complicated issue here in 7th Street 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.700
 since there are always two instances 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.820
 final finals moments I just had 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.700
 that having an injury was an injury 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.870
 of the shoulder that was already dragging 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.860
 dragging and competing like this or 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 I was 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.580
 it was no longer a yellow color 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 red was the color of the equator represents 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.630
 the shirt of the equator and had to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.000
 follow me or be like this with my pain and everything 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.270
 keep fighting and representing good to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.240
 Ecuador and there was already a point that no longer 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.670
 I endured then I had to go back 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.030
 unfortunately here back that we 're going 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.450
 to offer this season on 7th Street this 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.340
 season this season I think that 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.040
 I come to thank all those people 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.390
 the support that this support has given me 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.310
 unconditional 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.020
 I think I'm coming for them again 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.020
 this fourth season for them I'm 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.760
 here and for them I want to give you this 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.970
 championship that I have been asked so much 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.180
 so this season or I'll go to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.860
 step as I've always said no since 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.420
 Now I'm going to believe and the champion 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.239
 to go step by step because there are already 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.220
 experiences that you lived entrusted to 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.650
 final and lost but this time I'm going 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.440
 step by step but step by step firm and 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.660
 like I go for this championship for all 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.710
