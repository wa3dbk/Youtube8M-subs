00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
first day you can do the rate in less

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.629 
first day you can do the rate in less

it's<00:05:49.599> very<00:05:49.990> easy<00:05:50.199> once<00:05:50.589> you<00:05:50.620> get<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.800> slightly

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
it's very easy once you get a slightly
