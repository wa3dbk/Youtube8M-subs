footnote<00:00:42.760> studio<00:00:43.240> which<00:00:43.510> I'm<00:00:43.690> sure<00:00:43.900> most<00:00:44.500> of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
footnote studio which I'm sure most of

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.380 
footnote studio which I'm sure most of
you<00:00:44.770> are<00:00:44.800> wondering<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.490> the<00:00:45.730> answer<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.180> is

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
you are wondering and the answer that is

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.450 
you are wondering and the answer that is
look<00:00:47.050> at<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.260> name<00:00:47.440> yes<00:00:47.830> this<00:00:48.010> allows<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.370> to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
look at the name yes this allows you to

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.960 
look at the name yes this allows you to
create<00:00:48.610> animations<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.270> full<00:00:49.570> 3d<00:00:50.290> using<00:00:50.770> the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
create animations in full 3d using the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.550 
create animations in full 3d using the
stereoscopic<00:00:51.970> 3d<00:00:52.000> effects<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.840> 3ds<00:00:53.260> and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
stereoscopic 3d effects of the 3ds and

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.340 
stereoscopic 3d effects of the 3ds and
of<00:00:53.710> course<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.070> new<00:00:54.400> 3ds<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.420> it's<00:00:55.989> very

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
of course the new 3ds and it's very

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.350 
of course the new 3ds and it's very
clever<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.860> use<00:00:57.010> three<00:00:57.400> different<00:00:57.760> planes<00:00:58.030> of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
clever you use three different planes of

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.590 
clever you use three different planes of
depth<00:00:58.720> as<00:00:59.020> it<00:00:59.140> were<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.910> use<00:01:01.090> them<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.510> you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
depth as it were and you use them so you

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.060 
depth as it were and you use them so you
have<00:01:01.630> a<00:01:01.810> foreground<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.620> sort<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.920> Mick

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
have a foreground to sort of a Mick

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.439 
have a foreground to sort of a Mick
ground<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.460> background<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.269> use

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
ground the background and you can use

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.539 
ground the background and you can use
that<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:05.049> create<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.379> clever<00:01:05.710> sort<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.100> 3d

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
that to create a clever sort of 3d

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.340 
that to create a clever sort of 3d
effect<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.180> works<00:01:07.420> really<00:01:07.780> well<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.200> it's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
effect and it works really well and it's

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.620 
effect and it works really well and it's
surprisingly<00:01:09.040> easy<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.520> use<00:01:09.760> actually<00:01:10.300> but<00:01:10.540> is

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
surprisingly easy to use actually but is

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.390 
surprisingly easy to use actually but is
this<00:01:10.780> little<00:01:11.050> package<00:01:11.409> good<00:01:11.650> on<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.190> whole

can either use a beginner set or you can

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.920 
can either use a beginner set or you can
use<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.460> more<00:01:54.670> advanced<00:01:55.060> set<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:55.750> would

use a more advanced set and we would

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.899 
use a more advanced set and we would

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
recommend using the beginner set at

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.609 
recommend using the beginner set at

awful Al's to say about it to be honest
it's<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.299> animation<00:02:52.959> tool<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.410> that's

do there's nothing particularly fancy is

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.030 
do there's nothing particularly fancy is
very<00:03:01.359> limb<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.840> know<00:03:01.959> limited<00:03:02.319> colors<00:03:02.799> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
very limb you know limited colors and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.509 
very limb you know limited colors and
things<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.340> that

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
things like that

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.849 
things like that
but<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.299> is<00:03:04.480> basic<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.019> that's<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.409> charm<00:03:05.709> of

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
but it is basic and that's the charm of

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.710 
but it is basic and that's the charm of
it<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.129> be<00:03:06.250> honest<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.940> fact<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:07.359> you<00:03:07.599> can

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it to be honest the fact is that you can

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.750 
it to be honest the fact is that you can
just<00:03:07.870> pick<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.170> up<00:03:08.409> make<00:03:09.099> a<00:03:09.129> little<00:03:09.370> animation

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
just pick it up make a little animation

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.059 
just pick it up make a little animation
and<00:03:10.299> that's<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:10.870> there's<00:03:11.230> no<00:03:11.290> faffing<00:03:11.950> around
