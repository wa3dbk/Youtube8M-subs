00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
doesn't make things easier to see
especially<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.440> using<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.190> very<00:00:42.000> dark

the<00:00:48.239> night<00:00:48.480> vision<00:00:48.840> has<00:00:48.989> been<00:00:49.140> improved<00:00:49.500> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the night vision has been improved as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.220 
the night vision has been improved as
you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.360> dramatically<00:00:51.360> instead<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you can see dramatically instead of a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
you can see dramatically instead of a
sort<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> monochrome<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.430> blurry<00:00:53.850> vision

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
sort of monochrome very blurry vision

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
sort of monochrome very blurry vision
you<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.809> almost<00:00:56.180> color<00:00:57.500> almost<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.829> daytime

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you get almost color almost of daytime

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
you get almost color almost of daytime
type<00:00:59.879> colors<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.930> colors<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.469> vibrant

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
type colors the colors are very vibrant

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.479 
type colors the colors are very vibrant
your<00:01:02.730> vision<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.710> clear<00:01:05.159> indeed

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
your vision is very very clear indeed

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
your vision is very very clear indeed
and<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.479> should<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.930> for

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and I think this is how it should be for

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
and I think this is how it should be for
the<00:01:07.979> creatures<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> night<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> also

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the creatures of the night but it also

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.070 
the creatures of the night but it also
adds<00:01:10.979> another<00:01:11.610> power<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> predator

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
adds another power which is the predator

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.370 
adds another power which is the predator
vision<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.280> predator<00:01:14.729> vision<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
vision and the predator vision is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
vision and the predator vision is
similar<00:01:16.409> again<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> activate<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> power

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
similar again you activate it as a power

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
similar again you activate it as a power
as<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:19.830> blue

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
as you see it's a little bit more blue

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.070 
as you see it's a little bit more blue
however<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:22.700> warm-blooded<00:01:23.700> creatures<00:01:24.299> will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
however all warm-blooded creatures will

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
however all warm-blooded creatures will
seem<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> glow<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.580> even<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
seem to glow you can even see them a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
seem to glow you can even see them a
little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.560> walls<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.159> short

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
little bit through walls at short

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
little bit through walls at short
distances<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.200> allow<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> hunt

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
distances which will allow you to hunt

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.420 
distances which will allow you to hunt
down<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:33.000> food<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:34.170> easier<00:01:34.619> now

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
down your your food a little easier now

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
down your your food a little easier now
that<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:36.030> separate<00:01:36.420> powers<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that is two separate powers and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960 
that is two separate powers and
obviously<00:01:37.229> powers<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.520> awkward

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
obviously powers can be a little awkward

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.810 
obviously powers can be a little awkward
to<00:01:39.000> set<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.540> however<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.310> vampire

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to set up however there it the vampire

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.690 
to set up however there it the vampire
sight<00:01:42.270> power<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.930> original<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.829> has<00:01:44.430> now

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
sight power the original one has now

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
sight power the original one has now
been<00:01:44.970> reworked<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.470> basically

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
been reworked so that it basically

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.700 
been reworked so that it basically
toggles<00:01:47.700> through<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.200> other<00:01:49.320> settings

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
toggles through all the other settings

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
toggles through all the other settings
so<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.200> press<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> once<00:01:52.909> when<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
so here it is off I press it once when I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
so here it is off I press it once when I
get<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> night<00:01:54.420> vision<00:01:55.100> press<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> again<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.990> get

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
