because<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.030> really<00:04:34.510> was<00:04:34.690> an<00:04:34.900> educational

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
because it really was an educational

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.190 
because it really was an educational
process<00:04:35.740> beyond<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.910> shattering<00:04:37.539> of<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.840> ego

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
process beyond the shattering of the ego

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.050 
process beyond the shattering of the ego
and<00:04:38.440> there<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.740> shattering<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.669> ego<00:04:39.910> and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
and there is a shattering of the ego and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.940 
and there is a shattering of the ego and
when<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> player<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.840> your<00:04:41.050> stature<00:04:41.320> has<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> get

when a player of your stature has to get
out<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.479> would<00:04:43.539> imagine<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.350> difficult

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
out there is I would imagine a difficult

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.110 
out there is I would imagine a difficult
time<00:04:45.190> coming<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.520> grips<00:04:45.669> with<00:04:45.789> your<00:04:45.940> own

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
time coming to grips with your own

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.350 
time coming to grips with your own
identity<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.990> know<00:04:47.020> am<00:04:47.350> I<00:04:47.740> merely<00:04:48.639> Jamal

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
identity you know am I merely Jamal

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.659 
identity you know am I merely Jamal
Wilkes<00:04:49.690> professional<00:04:50.289> athlete<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.039> cut<00:04:51.550> it

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
Wilkes professional athlete can I cut it

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.140 
Wilkes professional athlete can I cut it
as<00:04:51.760> Jamal<00:04:52.120> Wilkes<00:04:52.479> citizen<00:04:53.220> yeah<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.669> that

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
as Jamal Wilkes citizen yeah that that

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.620 
as Jamal Wilkes citizen yeah that that
is<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.389> very<00:04:55.930> real<00:04:56.260> process<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.919> think<00:05:00.630> if

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
is a very real process and I think if

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.570 
is a very real process and I think if
you're<00:05:01.990> fortunate<00:05:02.590> enough<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.310> have<00:05:03.430> the

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
you're fortunate enough to have the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.360 
you're fortunate enough to have the
support<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.389> if<00:05:05.289> you've<00:05:05.560> done<00:05:05.889> other<00:05:06.039> things

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
support and if you've done other things

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.050 
support and if you've done other things
beside<00:05:06.760> play<00:05:06.970> basketball<00:05:07.630> then<00:05:08.789> you<00:05:09.789> can

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
beside play basketball then you can

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.529 
beside play basketball then you can
gradually<00:05:10.600> come<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.960> grips<00:05:11.139> with<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:11.470> and

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
gradually come to grips with that and

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.810 
gradually come to grips with that and
you<00:05:13.539> know<00:05:13.660> you<00:05:13.840> sit<00:05:14.080> out<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:15.130> look<00:05:15.700> at
