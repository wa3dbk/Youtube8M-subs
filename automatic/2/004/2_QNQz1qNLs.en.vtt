transmitter to use it as a body box I've
had<00:00:16.520> good<00:00:16.670> luck<00:00:16.820> with<00:00:16.880> this<00:00:17.120> with<00:00:17.390> my<00:00:18.050> dx7<00:00:18.560> and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
had good luck with this with my dx7 and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.779 
had good luck with this with my dx7 and
several<00:00:19.070> people<00:00:19.310> in<00:00:19.369> teaching<00:00:19.580> them<00:00:19.670> how<00:00:19.730> to

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
fly with a Super Cub so anyway can we go

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.210 
fly with a Super Cub so anyway can we go
gonna<00:00:22.250> need<00:00:22.400> a<00:00:22.429> very<00:00:23.300> dry<00:00:23.449> ver<00:00:24.009> pair<00:00:25.009> of<00:00:25.070> wire

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
gonna need a very dry ver pair of wire

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.300 
gonna need a very dry ver pair of wire
cutters<00:00:25.929> anyway<00:00:26.929> so<00:00:27.230> here<00:00:27.410> we<00:00:27.500> go<00:00:27.619> flip<00:00:28.189> the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
cutters anyway so here we go flip the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.900 
cutters anyway so here we go flip the
back<00:00:28.490> flip<00:00:28.880> it<00:00:28.970> over<00:00:29.089> to<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:29.300> back<00:00:30.880> go<00:00:31.880> ahead

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
back flip it over to the back go ahead

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.000 
back flip it over to the back go ahead
and<00:00:32.150> open<00:00:32.360> it<00:00:32.689> up<00:00:32.720> I<00:00:33.140> already<00:00:33.620> took<00:00:33.950> the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
and open it up I already took the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.030 
and open it up I already took the
liberty<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:34.460> loosening<00:00:34.880> these<00:00:35.000> screws<00:00:36.040> think

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
liberty of loosening these screws think

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.100 
liberty of loosening these screws think
a<00:00:37.130> little<00:00:37.340> faster<00:00:38.920> there's<00:00:39.920> one<00:00:40.430> two<00:00:41.239> three

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
a little faster there's one two three

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.130 
a little faster there's one two three
and<00:00:42.260> four<00:00:42.730> lift<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.850> back<00:00:44.000> cover<00:00:44.270> off<00:00:44.390> careful

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
and four lift the back cover off careful

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.330 
and four lift the back cover off careful
the<00:00:45.230> screws<00:00:45.469> are<00:00:45.590> gonna<00:00:45.680> fall<00:00:45.980> out<00:00:46.129> when<00:00:46.219> you

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
the screws are gonna fall out when you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.229 
the screws are gonna fall out when you
sit<00:00:46.520> down<00:00:47.980> all<00:00:48.980> right<00:00:49.039> I<00:00:49.309> guess<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.670> mess<00:00:50.059> well

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
sit down all right I guess you mess well

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.990 
sit down all right I guess you mess well
that's<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.350> wires<00:00:51.559> hearing<00:00:52.129> all<00:00:52.579> kinds<00:00:52.609> of

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
that's the wires hearing all kinds of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.369 
that's the wires hearing all kinds of
things<00:00:53.180> will<00:00:53.390> intimidating<00:00:53.899> isn't<00:00:54.020> it<00:00:54.199> no

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
things will intimidating isn't it no

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.049 
things will intimidating isn't it no
it's<00:00:54.590> not<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:54.859> bad<00:00:55.010> anyway<00:00:55.309> here<00:00:55.579> or<00:00:55.699> here<00:00:55.969> we

want this black one snippy snippy then
on<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.450> other<00:01:23.479> side<00:01:24.079> of<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.259> connector

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
on the other side of the connector

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.760 
on the other side of the connector
there's<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.009> red<00:01:25.430> wire<00:01:28.119> go<00:01:29.119> ahead<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.770> undo

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
there's a red wire go ahead and undo

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.560 
there's a red wire go ahead and undo
that<00:01:30.979> one<00:01:32.259> okay<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.880> go<00:01:34.880> ahead<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.299> like<00:01:35.450> to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
get rid of the excess wire also you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.319 
get rid of the excess wire also you
don't<00:01:37.220> want<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.430> short<00:01:37.759> out<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:38.149> any<00:01:38.299> reason

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
once we get down in here I just cut it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.210 
once we get down in here I just cut it
as<00:01:58.159> short<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.610> can<00:02:01.390> that's<00:02:02.390> good<00:02:03.220> and

if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.830> want<00:02:13.100> some<00:02:13.970> people<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> snip<00:02:15.110> off

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
if you want some people like to snip off

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.350 
if you want some people like to snip off
the<00:02:15.319> extra<00:02:15.709> some<00:02:16.250> some<00:02:16.640> say<00:02:16.819> it's<00:02:16.970> easier<00:02:17.239> to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the extra some some say it's easier to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
it tight and you don't know if you can

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.110 
it tight and you don't know if you can
see<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.280> black<00:02:28.489> wire<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:29.000> in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
see this but the black wire is up in

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.250 
see this but the black wire is up in
here<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.690> cut<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.200> a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
here so I'm going to cut this one to a
