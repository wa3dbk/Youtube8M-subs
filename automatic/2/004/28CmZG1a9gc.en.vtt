should have written shark Drake so this
first<00:03:15.150> losses<00:03:15.890> definitely<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:16.950> my<00:03:16.980> hands

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.380 

I<00:03:22.239> don't<00:03:22.989> play<00:03:23.230> exceed<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.120> rewarding<00:03:25.120> why

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
I don't play exceed so rewarding why

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:37.600 
I don't play exceed so rewarding why
would<00:03:25.659> be<00:03:26.219> pointless

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.730 

I<00:03:37.700> decided<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.690> there's<00:03:38.870> no<00:03:39.020> point<00:03:39.290> even<00:03:39.410> try

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
I decided that there's no point even try

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.520 
I decided that there's no point even try
because<00:03:39.770> in<00:03:40.160> charge<00:03:40.430> HR<00:03:40.700> trick<00:03:41.260> easily<00:03:42.260> kill

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
because in charge HR trick easily kill

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.190 
because in charge HR trick easily kill
one<00:03:42.980> thing<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.460> decided<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.200> really

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
one thing so I decided to really

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.090 
one thing so I decided to really
