the wheel also wedge the smaller block

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
the wheel also wedge the smaller block
in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> front<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:43.940> okay<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:46.820> work<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in the front up here okay and work the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.110 
in the front up here okay and work the
wheel<00:00:48.150> back<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.449> forth<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:50.160> try<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
wheel back and forth and just try to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
wheel back and forth and just try to
rock<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.350> hub<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> didn't

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
rock the the hub out that way it didn't

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
rock the the hub out that way it didn't
get<00:00:53.730> too<00:00:53.970> cocked<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.750> okay<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> trick

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
get too cocked in there okay the trick

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.469 
get too cocked in there okay the trick
to<00:00:56.809> separating<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:59.250> hub<00:00:59.610> here<00:01:00.089> without

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
to separating this hub here without

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.460 
to separating this hub here without
damaging<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:02.989> ABS<00:01:03.989> sensor<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
damaging the ABS sensor is you have to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.680 
damaging the ABS sensor is you have to
push<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:09.170> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.409> center<00:01:10.770> spindle<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.700> as

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
push in on the center spindle here as

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.020 
push in on the center spindle here as
hard<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.440> okay

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
hard as you can okay

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
hard as you can okay
while<00:01:17.090> cocking<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> entire<00:01:18.600> brake<00:01:19.049> rotor

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
while cocking the entire brake rotor

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.270 
while cocking the entire brake rotor
assembly<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.960> towards<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
assembly up and towards you with the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
assembly up and towards you with the
connector<00:01:23.760> being<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> top<00:01:24.659> side<00:01:25.020> here

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
connector being on the top side here

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.950 
connector being on the top side here
okay<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.410> so<00:01:28.410> by<00:01:28.590> pushing<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.430> CV<00:01:30.330> joint<00:01:30.660> back

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
okay and so by pushing the CV joint back

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.690 
okay and so by pushing the CV joint back
far<00:01:31.350> enough<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:32.580> provides<00:01:33.060> enough<00:01:33.390> room<00:01:33.690> for

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
far enough it provides enough room for

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.000 
far enough it provides enough room for
the<00:01:35.700> ABS<00:01:36.450> sensor<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.080> come<00:01:37.290> through<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.770> ship

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
the ABS sensor to come through the ship

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.100 
the ABS sensor to come through the ship
without<00:01:38.310> damaging<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> connection<00:01:39.840> here

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
without damaging the connection here

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
without damaging the connection here
it's<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.980> bad<00:01:41.220> design<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.280> connector

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it's just bad design that the connector

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
it's just bad design that the connector
itself<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.630> actually<00:01:46.200> larger<00:01:46.800> in<00:01:46.920> diameter

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
itself is actually larger in diameter

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.080 
itself is actually larger in diameter
than<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.950> than<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> diameter<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> rotor

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
than the than the diameter of the rotor

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
than the than the diameter of the rotor
here<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.230> stupid<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> way

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
here it's kind of stupid that's the way

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.380 
here it's kind of stupid that's the way
you<00:01:53.760> have<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.120> do<00:01:54.270> it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.450 

you
