there's<00:02:23.220> these<00:02:23.459> radios<00:02:23.940> below<00:02:24.150> they<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.480> got

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
there's these radios below they just got

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.330 
there's these radios below they just got
PML<00:02:24.989> radios<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.769> one<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.100> actually

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
PML radios it is one it's actually

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.880 
PML radios it is one it's actually
wedged<00:02:26.610> inside<00:02:26.910> his<00:02:27.239> fucking<00:02:27.569> helmet<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.230> know

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
wedged inside his fucking helmet I know

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.380 
wedged inside his fucking helmet I know
it's<00:02:29.069> an<00:02:29.130> also<00:02:29.370> pick<00:02:29.580> up<00:02:29.670> thing<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.030> basically

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it's an also pick up thing is basically

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.390 
it's an also pick up thing is basically
when<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.720> start<00:02:30.780> talking<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.950> starts

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
when you start talking it starts

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.590 
when you start talking it starts
transmitting<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> when<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> don't<00:02:33.299> talk<00:02:33.480> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
transmitting and when you don't talk it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.000 
transmitting and when you don't talk it
doesn't<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.049> he's<00:02:34.200> got<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.440> next<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.709> his<00:02:34.769> mouth

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
doesn't so he's got it next to his mouth

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.539 
doesn't so he's got it next to his mouth
now<00:02:36.000> obviously<00:02:36.360> using<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.170> helmet<00:02:38.130> audio

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
now obviously using in helmet audio

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.009 
now obviously using in helmet audio
technologies<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.329> know<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.690> could<00:02:39.840> be<00:02:39.959> an

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
technologies I know that could be an

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.479 
technologies I know that could be an
awful<00:02:40.230> lot<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:40.799> what<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> hear

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
awful lot there because what I hear

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.479 
awful lot there because what I hear
through<00:02:42.120> my<00:02:42.299> little<00:02:42.480> radio<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:44.810> what<00:02:45.810> yeah

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
through my little radio is what yeah

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.199 
through my little radio is what yeah
because<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.640> course<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> other<00:02:48.060> things

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
because of course of the other things

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.270 
because of course of the other things
you<00:02:48.329> cannot<00:02:48.540> deploy<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.709> one-way<00:02:50.070> radio

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
you cannot deploy it's a one-way radio

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.430 
you cannot deploy it's a one-way radio
and<00:02:50.850> there's<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.959> problem<00:02:52.170> because

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and there's a bit of a problem because

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.319 
and there's a bit of a problem because
when<00:02:52.680> he<00:02:52.769> said<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.070> me<00:02:53.190> straight<00:02:53.579> over<00:02:53.940> second

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
when he said to me straight over second

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.479 
when he said to me straight over second
exit<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:55.530> course<00:02:55.769> I'm<00:02:55.920> paying<00:02:56.130> attention<00:02:56.220> of

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
exit of course I'm paying attention of

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.310 
exit of course I'm paying attention of
the<00:02:56.549> road<00:02:56.640> as<00:02:56.760> well<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.810> thought<00:02:58.079> he<00:02:58.260> just

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
the road as well and I thought he just

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.349 
the road as well and I thought he just
said<00:02:58.890> second<00:02:59.430> exit<00:02:59.790> because<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.030> didn't<00:03:00.239> hear

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
said second exit because I didn't hear

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.310 
said second exit because I didn't hear
the<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:00.600> bit<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.019> was<00:03:01.109> very<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.959> went

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
the first bit but it was very so I went

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.630 
the first bit but it was very so I went
for<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> second<00:03:04.709> basic<00:03:04.890> why<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.340> going

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
for the second basic why are you going

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.060 
for the second basic why are you going
why<00:03:06.180> are<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.570> up<00:03:07.109> sorry<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.739> misheard

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
why are you going up sorry I misheard

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.670 
why are you going up sorry I misheard
you<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.390> then<00:03:09.570> starts<00:03:10.019> giving<00:03:10.200> me<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> lecture

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
you and then starts giving me a lecture

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.590 
you and then starts giving me a lecture
saying<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.130> I've<00:03:11.220> said<00:03:11.670> go<00:03:11.910> straight<00:03:12.420> over

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
saying if I've said go straight over

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.039 
saying if I've said go straight over
second<00:03:13.440> exit<00:03:14.359> then<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.540> should<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.989> straight

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
second exit then you should go straight

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.050 
second exit then you should go straight
over<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> roundabout<00:03:17.100> then<00:03:17.280> use<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.670> second

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
over the roundabout then use the second

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000 
over the roundabout then use the second
exit<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.720> next<00:03:18.989> bits<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.829> there's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
exit and the next bits just so there's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.319 
exit and the next bits just so there's
nothing<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.549> do<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.820> when<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.090> didn't

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
nothing I can do is when it didn't

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.520 
nothing I can do is when it didn't
matter<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.049> go<00:03:22.170> around<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
matter because you just go around the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.430 
matter because you just go around the
ramp<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.070> catch<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:23.970> them<00:03:24.239> I'm<00:03:25.230> trapped

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
ramp and catch up with them I'm trapped

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.710 
ramp and catch up with them I'm trapped
I<00:03:25.500> spend<00:03:25.739> most<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.250> test<00:03:26.489> either<00:03:27.239> quite<00:03:27.690> a

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
I spend most of the test either quite a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.789 
I spend most of the test either quite a
way<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.079> front<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> us<00:03:28.859> or<00:03:29.160> behind<00:03:30.799> putting

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
way in front of us or behind putting

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.140 
way in front of us or behind putting
opposition's<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:32.609> I've<00:03:32.700> got<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.880> hidden

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
opposition's and so I've got a hidden

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.130 
opposition's and so I've got a hidden
most<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.450> time<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.810> doesn't<00:03:34.049> really

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
most the time but it doesn't really

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.770 
most the time but it doesn't really
matter<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.590> long<00:03:34.650> as<00:03:34.739> you're<00:03:34.859> safe

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
matter because as long as you're safe

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.160 
matter because as long as you're safe
that's<00:03:36.320> all<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:37.130> really<00:03:37.370> mutters<00:03:37.910> on<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.960> it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170
