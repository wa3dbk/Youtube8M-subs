00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Today I follow in the film factory 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.920
 a little movie frankenweenie by 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.690
 tim burton comes to the cinema 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.700
 and that's a classic stop again 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.790
 motion animationsfilm if now 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 some ask stop motion what is that 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.759
 still christ and corpse bride 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 were synonymous of timber that's just this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.220
 presentation as 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 it's all moving a bit 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.750
 jerking league that is because 24 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 Pictures are taken per second 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.600
 then these little figures have to be 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.449
 a minimal thing will be changed per image 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.820
 foto again what changed next picture 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.929
 So very expensive to produce and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
 now just the story of that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.040
 little boy who has his dog and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.020
 This dog dies from an accident and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.149
 but he is so scientific 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 so excited the little boy basta 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.090
 a little bit around and something 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 happens he will live again 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 Of course, the very crazy thing is that awesome 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.969
 franken how on a bit 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.039
 frankenstein is based on the family 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.719
 is also called frankenstein that is very 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.699
 charming and what I especially devil 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.649
 sms on this short movie based on tim 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.739
 burton, but he's just like that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.030
 courageous is a black and white 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.590
 to bring animated film to the cinema and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.590
 how the whole looks you see here 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.570
 you see it already there is extremely 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 a lot of love for the detail over it has me 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.740
 That's right back to childhood 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.230
 I brought back such films 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 Simply stop motion brings so much love 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.740
 to detail always over and has 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.390
 these films also or rather in more 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.310
 black white it is he from the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.110
 History of the way he 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.300
 is told and a lot of the characters 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.520
 much more colorful than some at the computer 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.440
 generated animated film and I have to 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.300
 absolutely must watch because he has so 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.640
 many allusions to this horror 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.620
 genre on partly so gay movies or 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.910
 in general the movie story that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.490
 This film is actually in the cinema 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.440
 You must have seen it unbelievable 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.030
 strong that in the tim burton movie is 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.710
 You always notice that with him anyway 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.270
 because he is very weird but we were 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.890
 because these two systems and stop motion 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.780
 you know the film of you has the feeling 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.410
 okay you are not missing right now 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.760
 a lot more 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.530
 that's really just a self 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.130
 Quote a self quote a self 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.750
 quote 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.790
 you just have to admit to be fair, 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.440
 that frankenweenie the short film before her 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.060
 the other movie was and he himself 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.640
 probably more the creative input 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.170
 has brought in this film, however 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.460
 you have to say the movie is coming in now 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.440
 the cinemas i know the other one 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.910
 junk and there it is at some places 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.560
 a bit tiring, too 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.810
 gags are always meant to be the same kind 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.040
 and wise as you know it but then 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.720
 I actually prefer to see them 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.650
 film where there is a lot of what I am 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.120
 somehow already know 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.800
 but it works and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.480
 is actually funny as if I were 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.220
 now totally innovating something new 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.690
 but it does not work and that 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.880
 The movie actually gets really good 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.440
 Tim Burton fans will not be new 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.060
 none of tim burton knows about it yet 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.770
 but in any case, find something 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.720
 and you will definitely 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.670
 who should look at it all 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.900
 every time tim burton fans my god there 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.610
 comes a movie of our big one 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.890
 favorite director I say now 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.900
 which the big big tim burton club 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.820
 be sure to also look at vesta chat 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.560
 Animated films should like this one 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.570
 movie not to miss so many movie 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.370
 just do not get into this style 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.590
 cinema, however, please necessarily 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.550
 you can not go in there 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.450
 just look at women of colors 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.660
 black and white movie is when you say 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.989
 even in 2013 it should be colorful 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.700
 his 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.100
 keep away from it and even if 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.360
 Now, yes, that's what touches me 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.470
 not so now or I'm interested 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.090
 not that it's not perfect 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.430
 animated somehow I want 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.230
 really cool and completely perfect 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.990
 Of course, the film is not for 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.460
 you 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.230
 The review is still thumbs down 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.860
 happy to top otherwise the thumb 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.750
 downward 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.210
 Generally I would like to know what 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.900
 are your favorite stop motion 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.340
 maybe you could 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.690
 also a little bullet what is there there 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.520
 yet or what have you seen 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.770
 coraline is an example 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.390
 wallace and gromit or the pirates 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.270

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.400

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.020

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.060
