 you know yourself it is very difficult to go through 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.940
 the jungle even the golem will have problems 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.240
 Why am I saying that you can not take 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.970

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.520

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.910

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:09.170
 monsters yes you exaggerate 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:15.860
 the jungle is not as dangerous wife oh night i 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:19.900

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.270

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.820

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.820

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:49.260
 best type go galin 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.709

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.760
 olives and villages were jungle well how 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:02.410
 the jungle rather it was a forest I caught there 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.989
 chickens and picked apples well then me everything 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.090
 understandable because the jungle you absolutely 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.829
 another place 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:14.019
 terrible things can happen here i 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.810
 I have survived and even cats that somehow 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.510
 long lived in the city, our team performed 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.480
 various tasks all you got we 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.840
 divided among themselves once we were sent 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.140
 catch and then fucking ocelot cat yes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.319
 we ran through the jungle all dense already 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.410
 three days we tried to find at least one 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.889
 but then we found the temple one of ours 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.920
 ran first wanted to find 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:46.410
 treasure 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.120
 and how do you think the arrow is straight in the face 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.849
 dead place is not a pity 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.610
 I would nâ€™t want to be careful 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.610
 putting an arrow between the eyes is for sure 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:24.460

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.840
