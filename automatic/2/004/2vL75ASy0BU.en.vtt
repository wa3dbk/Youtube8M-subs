00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.719
 passersby that last Sunday 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.960
 they enjoyed the walk by the edge 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:41.760
 taltal coastal and we also had the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.889
 opportunity to meet with this 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.960
 fishing activity where a boat 

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:49.359
 of san antonio which you see in 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.120
 screen came up to the new very 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.510
 Taltal fishermen with more than 60 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.089
 albacore about 30 sharks and one 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.209
 variety is captured in the network as the 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.030
 sunfish or emperor which were 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:06.760
 here raised with the crane of the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 fishermen jump and take us in this 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.530
 in this refrigerated truck to the area 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.250
 south 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 the albacore country caught on the net me 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.759
 fishermen said that there is a 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.190
 very important difference between the taste 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.470
 of the dawn with which you fish through 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.630
 the network like this do these these 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.210
 industrial and the tiresome 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.360
 spectators of taltal to the stick there is a 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.520
 great difference between the taste of 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.530
 Albacore meat married to the stick as 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.240
 the catch in the network 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.280
 they say that by suffering or drowning 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.100
 the truth the albacore in the network 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.610
 the meat acquires another flavor totally 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.509
 different from the house gives the stick there 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.450
 There is that flavor that we enjoy 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.759
 of the albacore that fishermen hunt 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.039
 alkaline that's why it has the flavor 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.259
 pretty special why are we going to 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.179
 talk about the conger colorado good and here 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.340
 in most sectors 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.430
 such professionals are seeing there 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.380
 with sanz envy and this large amount 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.130
 of albacora I imagine the millions that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.460
 they will have won here 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.050
 the boat with these products and that 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.930
 were captured precisely in the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.910
 littoral such tannin and I commented to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.090
 the state fishermen approved that all 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.280
 the new modification to the fishing law 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.110
 this is legal that can be done me 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.300
 they say that indeed these species 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.100
 the albacore the shark are species 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.040
 migratory and that can be captured 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.240
 at any mile or anywhere 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.860
 from the coast 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.870
 national so that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.780
 envy no more for the sinners of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.600
 taltal that they do not have the certain the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.570
 resources like to go hunting the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.390
 albacore as these boats do 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.740
 industrial but if they give us the 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.740
 albacore to the stick that has a flavor 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.730
 special that we have already commented and 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.940
 here is the psoe or emperor as you 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.250
 they call because we remember that the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.709
 artisanal fishermen in each region of 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.970
 chile put their own names to 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.970
 these species here we see 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.670
 these 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.100
 fish that also tells me they integrate a 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.730
 very delicious taste to the weight what the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.930
 emperor so in this way invite them
