more competitive it's actually a lot
more<00:01:44.759> difficult<00:01:45.509> than<00:01:46.410> initially<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.910> might

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
more difficult than initially you might

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760 
more difficult than initially you might
think<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.869> competitive<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.500> need<00:01:49.679> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
think to get competitive you need to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.529 
think to get competitive you need to
have<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> time<00:01:50.520> practicing<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.420> then

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
have a lot of time practicing and then

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.419 
have a lot of time practicing and then
the<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.229> fun<00:01:52.619> thing<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.129> you<00:01:53.190> have<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
the other fun thing is that you have to

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.369 
the other fun thing is that you have to
understand<00:01:53.849> sort<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> basic<00:01:54.840> physics<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:55.379 
understand sort of the basic physics of

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.529 
understand sort of the basic physics of
how<00:01:55.410> a<00:01:55.530> car<00:01:55.860> suspension<00:01:56.280> works<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.879> you<00:01:57.390> learn

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
how a car suspension works and you learn

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.119 
how a car suspension works and you learn
how<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.720> set<00:01:57.959> up<00:01:57.989> the<00:01:58.170> cars<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.800> handle

00:01:59.119 --> 00:01:59.129 
how to set up the cars to handle

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:01.130 
how to set up the cars to handle
differently<00:01:59.509> for<00:02:00.509> me<00:02:00.629> it's<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:00.929> much<00:02:01.080> about

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
differently for me it's as much about

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.900 
differently for me it's as much about
working<00:02:01.709> on<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.039> truck<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.489> getting<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> set

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910

working on the truck and getting the set
up<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.269> as<00:02:03.629> it<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.929> about<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.289> race<00:02:04.410> and
