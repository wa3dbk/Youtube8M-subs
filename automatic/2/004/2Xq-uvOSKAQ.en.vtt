00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.400 
this composition a 2d and no 3d layers
whatsoever<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.960> now<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.740> shape<00:02:20.130> layer

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410

press P for position and then we go to
the<00:02:27.300> timeline<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:30.660> trim<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> work

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
the timeline right and we trim the work

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.560 
the timeline right and we trim the work
area<00:02:31.710> down<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.920> two<00:02:32.880> seconds<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:35.570> the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
area down to two seconds and then the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.460 
area down to two seconds and then the
time<00:02:36.810> navigator<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:39.150> get<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> much<00:02:40.320> better

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
time navigator we get a much better

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.240 
time navigator we get a much better
resolution<00:02:40.830> by<00:02:41.220> dragging<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> left

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
resolution by dragging right to the left

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.930 
resolution by dragging right to the left
and<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.610> beginning<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.980> I'll<00:02:47.310> click

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and this is the beginning so I'll click

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.240 
and this is the beginning so I'll click
the<00:02:48.270> position<00:02:48.690> stopwatch<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.920> create<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the position stopwatch to create a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.900 
the position stopwatch to create a
keyframe<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> beginning<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> comp

keyframe for the beginning of the comp

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.330 
keyframe for the beginning of the comp
I'm<00:02:53.910> going<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> go<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:56.360> two<00:02:57.360> seconds<00:02:59.150> and<00:03:00.320> I

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
I'm going to go to two seconds and I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.949 
I'm going to go to two seconds and I
drag<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.790> ball<00:03:03.440> where<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> wanted<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.800> end<00:03:04.980> up

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
drag the ball where I wanted to end up

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.210 
drag the ball where I wanted to end up
and<00:03:06.959> you'll<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.350> creates<00:03:07.680> keyframes<00:03:08.130> in

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and you'll see it creates keyframes in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
and you'll see it creates keyframes in
between<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.080> if<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.320> slide<00:03:10.560> back<00:03:10.590> some

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
between so now if you slide back some

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
between so now if you slide back some
forwards<00:03:11.310> you've<00:03:11.940> got<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> very<00:03:12.180> boring

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
forwards you've got a very boring

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.759 
forwards you've got a very boring
looking<00:03:12.870> ball<00:03:13.430> traveling<00:03:14.430> between<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.769> start

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
looking ball traveling between the start

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.530 
looking ball traveling between the start
position<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.190> end<00:03:17.340> position<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.180> not<00:03:18.390> what

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
position and end position it's not what

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.440 
position and end position it's not what
we<00:03:18.630> want<00:03:19.700> we<00:03:20.700> want<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.060> some<00:03:21.180> life

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
we want we want it to have some life

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.620 
we want we want it to have some life
okay<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.019> what<00:03:22.769> I'm<00:03:22.830> gonna<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.340> press<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.480> HOME

of<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.620> ball<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:08.959> can<00:04:09.959> see<00:04:10.049> these<00:04:10.170> two

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
of the ball you can see these two

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.710 
of the ball you can see these two
keyframes<00:04:10.590> here

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
keyframes here

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.530 
keyframes here
Linnea<00:04:13.130> if<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.280> drag<00:04:14.579> around<00:04:14.820> those<00:04:15.269> two

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
the interesting part the Y position this

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.730 
the interesting part the Y position this
is<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:39.070> top<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.910> bottom<00:04:41.200> shall<00:04:42.200> we<00:04:42.320> say<00:04:43.480> okay

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
is the top to bottom shall we say okay

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.850 
is the top to bottom shall we say okay
this<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:46.040> last<00:04:46.340> keyframe<00:04:46.640> here<00:04:47.830> with<00:04:48.830> a

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
this is the last keyframe here with a

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.740 
this is the last keyframe here with a
bald<00:04:49.130> on<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.400> bottom<00:04:49.850> right<00:04:50.360> hand<00:04:50.480> side<00:04:50.630> of

bald on the bottom right hand side of
the<00:04:50.930> screen<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:52.250> we<00:04:52.660> select<00:04:53.660> that<00:04:53.750> keyframe

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
the screen so we select that keyframe

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.420 
the screen so we select that keyframe
and<00:04:55.930> no<00:04:56.930> don't<00:04:57.320> want<00:04:57.500> click<00:04:57.650> it's<00:04:57.830> alright<00:04:58.130> we

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
and then we'll basically go back some

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.400 
and then we'll basically go back some
stage<00:05:09.320> earlier<00:05:09.740> in<00:05:09.860> time<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:11.690> paste<00:05:12.170> that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
stage earlier in time and paste that

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.080 
stage earlier in time and paste that
keyframe<00:05:14.590> number<00:05:15.590> 10<00:05:15.800> frames<00:05:16.130> sorry<00:05:16.910> another

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
keyframe number 10 frames sorry another

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:26.160 
keyframe number 10 frames sorry another
5<00:05:17.330> frames<00:05:17.600> are<00:05:22.600> 15<00:05:23.600> frames<00:05:23.870> frames<00:05:24.560> paste<00:05:25.490> that

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
5 frames are 15 frames frames paste that

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.030 
5 frames are 15 frames frames paste that
keyframe<00:05:27.170> with<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.380> borders<00:05:27.650> of<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.800> bottom

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
keyframe with the borders of the bottom

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.940 
keyframe with the borders of the bottom
right<00:05:28.190> there<00:05:28.760> again<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:30.440> is<00:05:30.590> on<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.770> wide

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
right there again this is on the wide

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.760 
right there again this is on the wide
position<00:05:31.130> only<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.840> then<00:05:33.080> paste<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.740> here

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
position only and then paste it here

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.410 
position only and then paste it here
again<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.800> again<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:40.130> gradually<00:05:40.850> lessen<00:05:41.330> the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
again and again and gradually lessen the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.670 
again and again and gradually lessen the
gaps<00:05:41.630> between<00:05:41.780> keyframes<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.990> end<00:05:46.420> no<00:05:47.680> that's

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
gaps between keyframes the end no that's

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.670 
gaps between keyframes the end no that's
created<00:05:49.100> keyframes<00:05:52.660> basically<00:05:53.660> on<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:54.230> y

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
created keyframes basically on the y

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:02.700 
created keyframes basically on the y
axis<00:05:54.710> so<00:05:58.450> we<00:06:00.070> need<00:06:01.070> to<00:06:01.310> make<00:06:01.940> this<00:06:02.090> ball<00:06:02.360> bounce

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
axis so we need to make this ball bounce

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.950 
axis so we need to make this ball bounce
so<00:06:03.710> it's<00:06:03.890> traveling<00:06:04.280> from<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:04.550> top<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:05.870> the

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
so it's traveling from the top to the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.050 
so it's traveling from the top to the
bottom<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.500> you<00:06:07.010> want<00:06:07.250> them<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> do<00:06:07.490> is<00:06:07.670> click

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
bottom so you want them to do is click

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.000 
bottom so you want them to do is click
on<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.270> first<00:06:08.840> keyframe<00:06:10.090> hold<00:06:11.090> down<00:06:11.300> alt<00:06:11.600> and

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
on the first keyframe hold down alt and

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.600 
on the first keyframe hold down alt and
drag<00:06:13.010> on<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.730> right<00:06:13.970> hand<00:06:14.240> side<00:06:15.400> on<00:06:16.400> the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
drag on the right hand side on the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:26.760 
drag on the right hand side on the
Bezier<00:06:17.060> handle<00:06:18.340> so<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.640> arc

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.190
