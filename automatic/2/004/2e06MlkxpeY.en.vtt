00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 at the hands of the work 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.400
 now draw a vertical line that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.340
 divide the sides more in half 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.990
 big shoe box help yourself 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.990
 a ruler and pencil to do it 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:38.239
 now cut the box by the lines that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.239
 you marked in the previous step very well 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.280
 look at the video to do it well 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:51.720
 choose one of the small sides of the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.909
 box and unmold the step before me now 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.460
 There were some pieces of cardboard left 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.960
 that protrudes cut them until you 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.960
 let the figure shown 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.740
 go back to take a side and if you mark 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.690
 new the center of each of the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.970
 lateral 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.890
 then cut the base from the sides until 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.310
 get to the midpoint you just got 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310
 point 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.090
 with the help of a rule points to a point 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.890
 in the vertical half of the sides 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.869
 then make a line that goes from this 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.530
 to the midpoint of the base that you had 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.479
 painted in the previous step look at the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:02:03.149
 video to make sure you do it 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:02:05.039
 correctly with scissors cuts 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.500
 the outline of the lines you finish 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.679
 draw leaving 2 centimeters of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.679
 distance 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.709
 let's say fold the cardboard inwards 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.280
 by the lines that you have drawn in the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.280
 step 6 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.320
 look at the images to continue position 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.420
 a rule in the overture that they have 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.940
 stayed between side and side draws a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.670
 straight on the inside 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.280
 carefully fold the cardboard a little 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.350
 the line that you just pointed out later 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.350
 Mark one point on each side to one 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.890
 15 centimeters distance from the ruler 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.890
 checked 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.940
 keep watching the video carefully 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.400
 fold the box supporting the sides 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.180
 on the cardboard and mark with a pencil 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.800
 where they touch draws a line that links the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.690
 designated points 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.520
 then paint two lines 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.680
 perpendicular to those that you just 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.190
 draw and two centimeters of the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.290
 laterals very well still marking another 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.130
 parallel line that you just drew 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.550
 and 15 centimeters from the bend of the step 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.550
 previous 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.420
 Y 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.579
 in the previous step we have left a 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.739
 rectangle that you now have to cut 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.739
 be very careful with the cutter 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:57.549
 and paste the tabs of step 8 to your side 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.549
 contiguous, you are doing very well 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.060
 fold the drawer look where you play with the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.720
 heel you mark the point with a line and 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.720
 will cut 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.169
 one with adhesive tape to all 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.169
 corners 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.820
 paint the box of the color that you like 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.710
 place a piece of plastic paper on top of the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.260
 ventanita you have left mark in the box 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.940
 the rings of the windows with a 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.770
 rule one of the points you have pointed out 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.770
 and cut the plastic 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.910
 and 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.879
 now stick the plastic from the previous step 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.870
 inside the cabin so that 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.870
 cover the window 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.100
 with glue at the base of the cabin and 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.100
 stick it on top of the shoe box 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.719
 and 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.460
 let's say cut out the paper rollers from 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.120
 kitchen of the same x of the width of the 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.270
 shoe box lid 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.810
 then paint the rollers like you 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.810
 like 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.400
 take the rollers that you have built in 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.790
 the previous step I lived glued to the base 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.790
 the cover has remained beautiful
