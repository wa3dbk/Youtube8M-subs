the<00:00:54.300> steel<00:00:54.510> beam<00:00:55.129> might<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> couple<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the steel beam might get a couple of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
kilos there it's not much and though

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.670 
kilos there it's not much and though
there's<00:01:00.809> another<00:01:00.960> pallet<00:01:01.379> load<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
there's another pallet load of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.049 
there's another pallet load of
compressors<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.370> been<00:01:02.489> dropped<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
compressors that have been dropped but I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.539 
compressors that have been dropped but I
know<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> lot<00:01:03.449> smaller<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
know there are a lot smaller than this

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.530 
know there are a lot smaller than this
but<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.670> only<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:05.939> they're<00:01:06.119> worth<00:01:06.270> cutting

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
but I only think they're worth cutting

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.530 
but I only think they're worth cutting
apart<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.110> stripping<00:01:07.409> down<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.090> drain<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
apart and stripping down and drain the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.399 
apart and stripping down and drain the
oil<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> chuck<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> steel<00:01:10.650> scrap

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
oil and chuck them in a steel scrap

00:01:12.409 --> 00:04:06.339 
oil and chuck them in a steel scrap
that's<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.680> now

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.809 

I've<00:04:07.349> only<00:04:07.530> got<00:04:07.650> about<00:04:07.739> 40<00:04:08.159> yards<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.639> copper

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
I've only got about 40 yards of copper

they<00:04:59.190> come<00:04:59.400> off<00:04:59.580> but<00:04:59.820> there's<00:05:00.030> no<00:05:00.150> point

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
they come off but there's no point

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.340 
they come off but there's no point
really<00:05:01.310> that's<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.639> way

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.060

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
compressor I guess that's my certificate

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.830 
compressor I guess that's my certificate
