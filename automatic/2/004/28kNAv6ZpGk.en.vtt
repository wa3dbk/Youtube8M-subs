upward<00:00:05.879> sweep<00:00:06.330> just<00:00:06.660> fine<00:00:06.960> because<00:00:07.470> even

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
upward sweep just fine because even

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.100 
upward sweep just fine because even
three<00:00:08.250> nasty<00:00:08.490> plots<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.150> only<00:00:09.450> actually

actually have to battle but this is
enough<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.630> could<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:29.120> teleport<00:01:30.120> off

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.430 

even<00:01:36.310> professor<00:01:36.820> rowan<00:01:37.030> was<00:01:37.390> kind<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.200> random

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
even professor rowan was kind of random

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:48.150 
even professor rowan was kind of random
he<00:01:38.830> comes<00:01:39.610> by

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:02:01.280 

laughs<00:01:49.160> I<00:01:49.370> did<00:01:49.550> all<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.760> for<00:01:49.820> nothing

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.930 

okay<00:02:04.740> yeah<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.800> want<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.550> footage

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
okay yeah you want to have that footage

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.170 
okay yeah you want to have that footage
of<00:02:07.420> barking<00:02:07.990> nap<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:10.539> helps<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:12.180> track

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
of barking nap that helps you the track

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.850 
of barking nap that helps you the track
where<00:02:13.660> less<00:02:14.170> weight<00:02:14.410> goes<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:16.150> will<00:02:16.860> probably

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
where less weight goes I will probably

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.690 
where less weight goes I will probably
show<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.550> later<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:21.360> catching<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:23.700> that's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
show that later on catching it that's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:48.010 
show that later on catching it that's
quite<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:26.530> bit<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.910> tricky<00:02:27.910> process

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.100 

doesn't<00:02:48.920> short<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.460> what<00:02:49.640> makes<00:02:50.110> mesprit

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
doesn't short that what makes mesprit

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.900 
doesn't short that what makes mesprit
annoying<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.740> that<00:02:51.770> every<00:02:52.130> time<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.370> battle

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
annoying is that every time you battle

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.310 
annoying is that every time you battle
it's<00:02:53.120> going<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.330> want<00:02:54.520> just<00:02:55.520> just<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.320> basic

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
it's going to want just just a basic

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320 
it's going to want just just a basic
point<00:02:57.830> about<00:02:58.010> why<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:58.640> difficult<00:02:58.670> to

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
point about why it's so difficult to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:08.850 
point about why it's so difficult to
cash

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.300 

okay<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.250> have<00:03:10.400> seven<00:03:11.360> Badgers<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.049> get

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
okay so you have seven Badgers you get

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.830 
okay so you have seven Badgers you get
the<00:03:13.310> move<00:03:13.519> test<00:03:13.849> wrap<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:18.799> up<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.780> know

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the move test wrap this up here you know

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.539 
the move test wrap this up here you know
pretty<00:03:21.349> useful<00:03:21.620> application<00:03:22.610> lets<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.480> see

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
pretty useful application lets you see

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.089 
pretty useful application lets you see
which<00:03:25.549> types<00:03:26.420> are<00:03:26.659> strong<00:03:27.019> against<00:03:27.319> which<00:03:27.620> so

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
which types are strong against which so

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.440 
which types are strong against which so
you're<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.459> certain<00:03:28.760> about<00:03:28.940> something<00:03:29.390> you

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
you're not certain about something you

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.180 
you're not certain about something you
can<00:03:29.599> always<00:03:29.780> check<00:03:30.049> with<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.099> you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
can always check with that so that you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:49.890 
can always check with that so that you
don't<00:03:34.340> accidentally<00:03:34.760> go<00:03:34.970> into<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> bad<00:03:35.690> matchup

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.990 

ok<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.890> whole<00:03:51.010> thing<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.340> mess<00:03:51.610> but<00:03:51.819> I'm

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
ok so the whole thing with mess but I'm

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:07.910 
ok so the whole thing with mess but I'm

only thing I can hit the ghastly would

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.930 
only thing I can hit the ghastly would
be<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> future<00:04:25.810> site<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:27.400> long<00:04:27.550> as<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.730> bring

go on I'm actually pretty close to the

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.000 
go on I'm actually pretty close to the
point<00:05:51.820> that<00:05:51.910> I'm<00:05:52.150> gonna<00:05:52.330> do<00:05:52.660> like<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:53.200> ton<00:05:53.980> of

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010
