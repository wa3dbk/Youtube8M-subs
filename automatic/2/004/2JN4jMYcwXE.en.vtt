00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
but it doesn't matter because it's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.670 
but it doesn't matter because it's
quality<00:01:34.540> not<00:01:34.990> quantity<00:01:35.320> as<00:01:36.040> we<00:01:36.310> all<00:01:36.430> know<00:01:37.680> but

Apple you just turn on their devices and
it's<00:02:05.260> on<00:02:05.760> now<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.820> bildt's<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.330> this<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.780> very

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
it's on now the bildt's of this is very

it's very very small it is taller than
the<00:02:11.650> Apple<00:02:11.920> TV<00:02:12.219> and<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.579> does<00:02:12.790> feel<00:02:13.120> less

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the Apple TV and it does feel less

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830 
the Apple TV and it does feel less
how<00:02:15.430> would<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.580> say<00:02:15.820> less<00:02:16.210> well-built

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
how would I say less well-built

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.710 
how would I say less well-built
obviously<00:02:17.680> because<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:17.980> Apple<00:02:18.460> Apple<00:02:19.390> uses<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
obviously because of Apple Apple uses a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.840 
obviously because of Apple Apple uses a
different<00:02:20.290> material<00:02:20.380> than<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.280> plastic<00:02:21.700> on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
different material than the plastic on

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.630 
different material than the plastic on

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
minutes but in my hand just got tired

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.210 
minutes but in my hand just got tired
because<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.170> got<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.350> hold<00:03:26.500> your<00:03:26.650> remote<00:03:26.950> up
