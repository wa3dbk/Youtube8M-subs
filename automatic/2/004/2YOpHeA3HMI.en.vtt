some foods and bother putting on any

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
some foods and bother putting on any
types<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:26.189> thought<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.609> might<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:27.090> too<00:00:27.390> much

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
types I thought it might be too much

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269 
types I thought it might be too much
brown<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.410> can't<00:00:28.650> even<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.949> my<00:00:28.980> legs

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and what I liked about this was that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.830 
and what I liked about this was that
this<00:01:25.200> material<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.130> light<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.090> flowy
