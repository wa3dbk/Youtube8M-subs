I<00:01:55.500> guess<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.430> because

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I guess we're pretty it up because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.280 
I guess we're pretty it up because
otherwise<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.570> pretty<00:01:57.750> crude<00:01:58.020> looking

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
otherwise it's pretty crude looking

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.959 
otherwise it's pretty crude looking
