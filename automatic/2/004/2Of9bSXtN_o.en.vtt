00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
what direction Apple was taking with

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580

internals<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> iPhone<00:00:46.590> 5<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.190> preceded

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
internals as the iPhone 5 that preceded

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639 
internals as the iPhone 5 that preceded
it<00:00:47.850> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.539> no<00:00:48.840> longer<00:00:48.870> available

very<00:01:32.070> nice<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> hand<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.450> different

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
very nice in the hand and very different

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.899 
very nice in the hand and very different
from<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> expected<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> feel<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.729> of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
from what I expected it to feel and of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.429 
from what I expected it to feel and of
course<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.299> does<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> premium

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
course this does not have the premium

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
course this does not have the premium
feel<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.280> device<00:01:38.670> such<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> iPhone<00:01:39.090> 5

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
feel that a device such as the iPhone 5

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.810 
feel that a device such as the iPhone 5
or<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> iPhone<00:01:40.290> 5s<00:01:40.890> would<00:01:41.130> bring<00:01:41.340> along<00:01:41.579> with

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
or the iPhone 5s would bring along with

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
or the iPhone 5s would bring along with
it<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> doesn't<00:01:42.840> feel<00:01:42.990> cheap<00:01:43.049> by<00:01:43.530> any

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
it but it doesn't feel cheap by any

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.800 
it but it doesn't feel cheap by any

very<00:01:46.259> tactile<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> power<00:01:47.189> switch<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
very tactile the power switch and the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
very tactile the power switch and the
little<00:01:48.840> silent<00:01:49.259> switch<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.560> those<00:01:49.710> side<00:01:49.979> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
little silent switch on those side is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.039 
little silent switch on those side is
really<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.790> nice<00:01:50.970> they're<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:51.720> feel<00:01:52.020> very

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
really really nice they're all feel very

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
really really nice they're all feel very
sturdy<00:01:52.649> tactile<00:01:53.280> clicky<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.600> almost

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
sturdy tactile clicky and it almost

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
sturdy tactile clicky and it almost
feels<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.259> having<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.680> ceramic<00:01:56.189> device

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
feels like having a ceramic device

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
feels like having a ceramic device
instead<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> plastic<00:01:57.540> device<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.380> think

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
instead of a plastic device and I think

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.870 
instead of a plastic device and I think
that<00:01:58.710> has<00:01:58.860> something<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> steel

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that has something to do with the steel

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.870 
that has something to do with the steel
reinforcement<00:02:00.630> inside<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> actual<00:02:01.380> device

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
reinforcement inside the actual device

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.370 
reinforcement inside the actual device

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.210 
slightly animations I
as<00:02:12.270> designed<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:13.260> has<00:02:13.500> been<00:02:13.680> designed<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.070> work

as designed or has been designed to work

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.580 
as designed or has been designed to work
perfectly<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.940> iPhone<00:02:15.300> 5c<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.410> think

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
perfectly with the iPhone 5c and I think

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.230 
perfectly with the iPhone 5c and I think
that<00:02:16.710> these<00:02:16.860> two<00:02:17.100> work<00:02:17.340> very<00:02:17.700> nice<00:02:17.940> in

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
that these two work very nice in

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210 
that these two work very nice in
comparison<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.290> collaboration<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.100> one

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
comparison or in collaboration with one

comparison or in collaboration with one
another<00:02:20.550> now<00:02:21.300> as<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> guys<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.050> this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
another now as you guys can see this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
another now as you guys can see this
device<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:22.770> ever<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.130> slightly<00:02:23.430> thicker<00:02:23.760> than

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
device has ever so slightly thicker than

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.080 
device has ever so slightly thicker than
the<00:02:24.120> iPhone<00:02:24.450> 5<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.960> iPhone<00:02:25.050> 5s<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.280> actually

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s and actually

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.730 
the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s and actually
very<00:02:27.390> slightly<00:02:27.840> heavier<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> actually

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
very slightly heavier but I actually

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.040 
very slightly heavier but I actually
like<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.310> added<00:02:29.610> heft<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.660> iPhone

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
like this added heft because the iPhone

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.520 
like this added heft because the iPhone
5<00:02:31.380> was<00:02:31.770> almost<00:02:32.520> unrealistically<00:02:33.290> light<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
5 was almost unrealistically light it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.170 
5 was almost unrealistically light it
felt<00:02:34.770> really<00:02:35.040> weird<00:02:35.160> when<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.670> actually<00:02:35.880> first

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
felt really weird when I actually first

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.330 
felt really weird when I actually first
picked<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.720> almost<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.770> holding<00:02:37.980> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
picked it up almost like I was holding a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.430 
picked it up almost like I was holding a
weightless<00:02:39.090> product<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:39.990> like<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
weightless product but I do like the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.830 
weightless product but I do like the
heft<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.920> iPhone<00:02:41.250> 5c<00:02:41.820> has<00:02:42.060> though<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> lot

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
heft that the iPhone 5c has though a lot

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.480 
heft that the iPhone 5c has though a lot
of<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.080> may<00:02:43.230> not<00:02:43.470> because<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.340> been

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
of you may not because if you have been

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.580 
of you may not because if you have been
gotten<00:02:44.700> or<00:02:45.240> rather<00:02:45.540> if<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.050> gotten<00:02:46.380> used

to the iPhone 5 or the iPhone 5s this

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.830 
to the iPhone 5 or the iPhone 5s this
may<00:02:49.650> feel<00:02:49.860> slightly<00:02:50.490> heavier<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.180> now

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
may feel slightly heavier to you now

may feel slightly heavier to you now
let's<00:02:52.020> take<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> look<00:02:52.320> at<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.530> camera<00:02:52.830> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
let's take a look at this camera the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.860 
let's take a look at this camera the
camera<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.580> actually<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.970> carryover<00:02:54.570> 8

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
camera is actually a carryover 8

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290 
camera is actually a carryover 8
megapixel<00:02:55.410> camera<00:02:55.440> from<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> iPhone<00:02:56.370> 5<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.060> is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
megapixel camera from the iPhone 5 it is

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.510 
megapixel camera from the iPhone 5 it is
essentially<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.870> same<00:02:58.110> sensor<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.040> again

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
essentially the same sensor but in again

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.610 
essentially the same sensor but in again
a<00:02:59.760> different<00:03:00.240> body<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.020> basically<00:03:01.500> just

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
a different body it's basically just

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.470 
a different body it's basically just
like<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> internals<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.670> phone<00:03:02.880> it's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
like the internals of the phone it's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240 
like the internals of the phone it's
quick<00:03:03.840> its<00:03:04.110> snappy<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.830> great<00:03:05.070> with

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
quick its snappy it's great with

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.130 
quick its snappy it's great with
low-light<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:06.000> great<00:03:06.210> with<00:03:06.450> well-lit

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
low-light it's great with well-lit

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.420 
low-light it's great with well-lit
conditions<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.770> it's<00:03:07.890> very<00:03:08.130> good<00:03:08.310> with

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
conditions and it's very good with

course this code has become more and
more<00:03:31.350> famous<00:03:31.710> with<00:03:31.830> every<00:03:32.040> iteration<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.580> the

unfortunately it doesn't have the slow
motion<00:03:45.420> features<00:03:45.930> which<00:03:46.110> are<00:03:46.260> actually

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
motion features which are actually

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.790 
motion features which are actually
limited<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.970> iPhone<00:03:48.300> 5s<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.440> exchange

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
limited to the iPhone 5s but in exchange

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.860 
limited to the iPhone 5s but in exchange
they<00:03:50.130> actually<00:03:50.459> did<00:03:50.640> improve<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.390> quality<00:03:51.600> of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
they actually did improve the quality of

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.720 
they actually did improve the quality of
the<00:03:51.990> front-facing<00:03:52.410> camera<00:03:52.830> which<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.130> full<00:03:53.340> HD

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
the front-facing camera which is full HD

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.640 
the front-facing camera which is full HD
and<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.360> does<00:03:54.510> look<00:03:54.690> really<00:03:54.810> nice<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.260> HD

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650

FaceTime<00:03:56.100> calls<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.120> one<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.420> cool

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
FaceTime calls and one of the cool

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.690 
FaceTime calls and one of the cool
things<00:03:57.810> about<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.260> software<00:03:58.740> which<00:03:59.340> actually

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
things about the software which actually

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.880 
things about the software which actually
implements<00:04:00.120> itself<00:04:00.360> into<00:04:00.600> iOS<00:04:00.870> 7<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.680> fact

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
implements itself into iOS 7 is the fact

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.350 
implements itself into iOS 7 is the fact
that<00:04:01.980> there<00:04:02.190> is<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> burst<00:04:02.730> mode<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.150> if<00:04:03.270> you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
that there is a burst mode so if you

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.640 
that there is a burst mode so if you
press<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.600> hold<00:04:03.750> down<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.440> shutter

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
press and hold down on to the shutter

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.930 
press and hold down on to the shutter
button<00:04:04.740> it<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.160> actually<00:04:05.550> going<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.760> take

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
button it is actually going to take

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.780 
button it is actually going to take
multiple<00:04:06.810> photos<00:04:07.200> as<00:04:07.500> long<00:04:07.740> as<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.040> kept<00:04:08.280> or

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
multiple photos as long as you kept or

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.310 
multiple photos as long as you kept or
as<00:04:08.940> long<00:04:09.120> as<00:04:09.240> you<00:04:09.360> keep<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.690> button<00:04:09.959> held<00:04:10.230> down

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
as long as you keep the button held down

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.890 
as long as you keep the button held down
now<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.550> can<00:04:11.760> see<00:04:11.910> where<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.330> could<00:04:12.540> be<00:04:12.690> useful

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
now I can see where this could be useful

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300 
now I can see where this could be useful
in<00:04:13.320> case<00:04:13.380> you're<00:04:13.650> trying<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.950> capture<00:04:14.130> a

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
in case you're trying to capture a

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.820 
in case you're trying to capture a
fast-moving<00:04:14.790> object<00:04:15.510> but<00:04:15.990> it<00:04:16.080> isn't<00:04:16.350> as<00:04:16.500> fast

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
fast-moving object but it isn't as fast

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.039 
fast-moving object but it isn't as fast
as<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.130> iPhone<00:04:17.489> 5s<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.600> may<00:04:18.840> seem

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
as the iPhone 5s and so it may seem

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.719 
as the iPhone 5s and so it may seem
slightly<00:04:19.350> redundant<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.100> actually<00:04:20.400> have<00:04:20.549> this

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
slightly redundant to actually have this

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.610 
slightly redundant to actually have this
on<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> device<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.510> nonetheless<00:04:22.080> it<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.530> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
on the device but nonetheless it is a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020 
on the device but nonetheless it is a
nice<00:04:22.860> feature<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.700> show<00:04:23.850> your

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
nice feature to have to show your

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.620 
nice feature to have to show your
friends

strange<00:04:44.749> move<00:04:44.959> on<00:04:45.139> Apple's<00:04:45.499> part<00:04:45.740> but<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:45.949> do

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
strange move on Apple's part but I do

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.799 
strange move on Apple's part but I do
understand<00:04:46.610> why<00:04:46.789> they<00:04:46.969> created<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.509> iPhone

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:47.809 
understand why they created the iPhone

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.679 
understand why they created the iPhone
5c<00:04:48.469> and<00:04:48.830> it's<00:04:49.219> because<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.550> marketing<00:04:50.119> now<00:04:50.629> the

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689 
5c and it's because of marketing now the

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.989 
5c and it's because of marketing now the
iPhone<00:04:51.080> 5<00:04:51.349> is<00:04:51.619> a<00:04:51.649> really<00:04:52.129> really<00:04:52.369> nice<00:04:52.520> product

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:52.999 
iPhone 5 is a really really nice product

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.309 
iPhone 5 is a really really nice product
but<00:04:53.149> everyone<00:04:53.569> isn't<00:04:53.749> really<00:04:54.020> going<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.259> be

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
but everyone isn't really going to be

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.899 
but everyone isn't really going to be
interested<00:04:54.800> in<00:04:54.949> buying<00:04:55.129> an<00:04:55.339> older<00:04:55.669> generation

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
interested in buying an older generation

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.089 
interested in buying an older generation
device<00:04:56.569> so<00:04:57.169> what<00:04:57.319> would<00:04:57.439> Apple<00:04:57.709> do<00:04:57.830> with<00:04:57.979> all

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
device so what would Apple do with all

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.949 
device so what would Apple do with all
the<00:04:58.189> leftover<00:04:58.639> internals<00:04:59.089> put<00:04:59.599> them<00:04:59.719> into<00:04:59.929> a

00:04:59.949 --> 00:04:59.959 
the leftover internals put them into a

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.290 
the leftover internals put them into a
new<00:05:00.169> body<00:05:00.319> package<00:05:01.069> them<00:05:01.309> advertise<00:05:01.969> it<00:05:02.149> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
new body package them advertise it and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.029 
new body package them advertise it and
resell<00:05:02.719> it<00:05:02.869> and<00:05:02.990> that's<00:05:03.379> essentially<00:05:03.860> what

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
resell it and that's essentially what

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.790 
resell it and that's essentially what
the<00:05:04.129> iPhone<00:05:04.249> 5c<00:05:04.969> is<00:05:04.999> it's<00:05:05.809> an<00:05:05.899> iPhone<00:05:06.199> 5<00:05:06.469> in<00:05:06.709> a
