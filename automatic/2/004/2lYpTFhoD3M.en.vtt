I'm going to show you to do this if you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.880 
I'm going to show you to do this if you
look<00:00:44.180> up<00:00:44.420> other<00:00:44.660> illustrations<00:00:45.350> that<00:00:45.739> you

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
look up other illustrations that you

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.250 
look up other illustrations that you
find<00:00:46.190> online<00:00:46.460> it's<00:00:47.090> not<00:00:47.360> going<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.690> match<00:00:47.930> this

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
find online it's not going to match this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.369 
find online it's not going to match this
100%<00:00:48.890> but<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.940> way<00:00:50.120> I<00:00:50.149> do<00:00:50.360> it<00:00:50.600> will<00:00:50.930> get<00:00:51.140> you

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
100% but the way I do it will get you

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.340 
100% but the way I do it will get you
the<00:00:51.530> same<00:00:51.800> end<00:00:52.190> result<00:00:52.520> is<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.020> way<00:00:54.170> these

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
the same end result is the the way these

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.639 
the same end result is the the way these
other<00:00:54.590> illustrations<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.460> at<00:00:55.610> Riley<00:00:55.850> not<00:00:56.239> work

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
other illustrations is at Riley not work

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.470 
other illustrations is at Riley not work
it's<00:00:57.649> just<00:00:57.739> much<00:00:58.070> easier<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.640> manage<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.239> knot

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
it's just much easier to manage the knot

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.810 
it's just much easier to manage the knot
when<00:00:59.899> tying<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:00.590> way<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.399> what<00:01:01.579> I'm<00:01:01.670> going

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
when tying it this way so what I'm going

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.109 
when tying it this way so what I'm going
to<00:01:01.850> do<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.300> insert<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.949> line<00:01:04.190> through<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.089> eye

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
to do is insert the line through the eye

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.740 
to do is insert the line through the eye
of<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.539> hook<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:07.060> I'm<00:01:08.060> going<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.330> go<00:01:08.479> back

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
of the hook here I'm going to go back

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.450 
of the hook here I'm going to go back
and<00:01:09.220> double<00:01:10.220> back<00:01:10.400> around<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.979> then<00:01:12.979> start<00:01:13.340> it

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and double back around and then start it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.810 
and double back around and then start it
back<00:01:13.729> through<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.630> eye<00:01:14.659> of<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.049> hook<00:01:15.260> again

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
back through the eye of the hook again

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.490 
back through the eye of the hook again
which<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:17.000> going<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.180> leave<00:01:17.479> me<00:01:17.510> with<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:18.110> loop

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
which is going to leave me with a loop

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.600 
which is going to leave me with a loop
in<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.830> fishing<00:01:19.580> line<00:01:19.610> right<00:01:20.090> here<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:21.200> have

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
in the fishing line right here so I have

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.160 
in the fishing line right here so I have
the<00:01:22.610> loop<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.060> line<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.720> then<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:23.900> have

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the loop in the line and then I have

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.770 
the loop in the line and then I have
this<00:01:24.350> excess<00:01:24.950> piece<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.430> loose<00:01:25.640> line<00:01:25.970> what<00:01:26.689> I'm

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
this excess piece of loose line what I'm

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.190 
this excess piece of loose line what I'm
going<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:26.990> do<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.290> go<00:01:27.470> around<00:01:27.590> one<00:01:28.869> two<00:01:30.640> three

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
going to do is go around one two three

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.510 
going to do is go around one two three
four<00:01:34.150> five<00:01:35.350> around<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.530> tip<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.890> my<00:01:36.920> finger

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
four five around the tip of my finger

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.249 
four five around the tip of my finger
and<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:40.090> I'm<00:01:41.090> going<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.329> take<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.810> piece<00:01:42.049> of

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
and then I'm going to take this piece of

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.609 
and then I'm going to take this piece of
line<00:01:42.470> right<00:01:42.500> here<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.570> go<00:01:44.570> back<00:01:44.930> through<00:01:44.960> that

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
line right here and go back through that

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.569 
line right here and go back through that
loop<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:46.610> made<00:01:47.920> originally<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.369> line

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
loop that I made originally in the line

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.410 
loop that I made originally in the line
and<00:01:50.950> then<00:01:51.950> I'm<00:01:52.100> just<00:01:52.250> going<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.549> take<00:01:52.790> this<00:01:53.060> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
and then I'm just going to take this and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.670 
and then I'm just going to take this and
pull<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.530> tight

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
pull it tight

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.649 
pull it tight
and<00:01:58.060> there<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.210> go

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
and there you go

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.469 
and there you go
that's<00:02:00.049> how<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.439> tie<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:01.070> trolley<00:02:01.460> knot<00:02:01.939> this

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
that's how you tie a trolley knot this

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.800 
that's how you tie a trolley knot this
is<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.659> great<00:02:03.079> way<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.189> have<00:02:04.399> leaders<00:02:05.270> pre

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
is a great way if you have leaders pre

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.009 
is a great way if you have leaders pre
tied<00:02:06.079> and<00:02:06.670> you're<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:07.880> adding<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.599> slip

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
tied and you're just adding a slip

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.430 
tied and you're just adding a slip
sinker<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.940> your<00:02:10.940> mainline<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> leader<00:02:12.200> and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
sinker and your mainline to a leader and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.559 
sinker and your mainline to a leader and
a<00:02:12.500> swivel<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> great<00:02:13.940> way<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.180> attach

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
a swivel this is a great way to attach

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.420 
a swivel this is a great way to attach
it<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.930> hook<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.590> that's<00:02:15.800> how<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.069> tie<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430

trolley knot

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.990
