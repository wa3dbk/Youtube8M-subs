00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
video is a actual test of this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.240 
video is a actual test of this
microphone<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.710> hear<00:01:44.070> or

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
microphone so you can actually hear or

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.639 
microphone so you can actually hear or
how<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.729> sounds<00:01:45.570> because<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.409> probably

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
how it sounds because that's probably

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
how it sounds because that's probably
something<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> are

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
something you want to know if you are
