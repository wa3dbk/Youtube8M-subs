Parker for a while or did he just have
this<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:21.080> time<00:02:21.620> off<00:02:21.890> for<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> little<00:02:22.280> bit<00:02:22.460> at

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
this this time off for a little bit at

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.160 
this this time off for a little bit at
the<00:02:22.610> end<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> movie<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.780> then<00:02:23.930> when<00:02:24.080> you

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the end of the movie and then when you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.500 
the end of the movie and then when you
went<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.320> go<00:02:24.440> fight<00:02:24.710> rhino<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:26.000> was<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.330> I

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
went to go fight rhino that was it I

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.230 
went to go fight rhino that was it I
will<00:02:27.140> say<00:02:27.350> this<00:02:27.560> man<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.430> watch<00:02:28.580> the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
will say this man if you watch the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.020 
will say this man if you watch the
matrix<00:02:30.280> revolution<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.700> matrix

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
matrix revolution and the matrix

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.960 
matrix revolution and the matrix
reloaded<00:02:33.340> they<00:02:34.340> could<00:02:34.550> have<00:02:34.580> done<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.820> little

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
reloaded they could have done a little

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.390 
reloaded they could have done a little
bit<00:02:35.180> better<00:02:35.420> with<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.440> important<00:02:36.980> and

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
bit better with the right important and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.070 
bit better with the right important and
I'm<00:02:37.490> hoping<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.150> gets<00:02:38.270> better<00:02:38.540> later<00:02:38.990> on

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
I'm hoping that it gets better later on

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.070 
I'm hoping that it gets better later on
but<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.190> look<00:02:40.340> at<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.550> matrix<00:02:40.970> that's<00:02:41.720> how

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
but if you look at the matrix that's how

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.699 
but if you look at the matrix that's how
you<00:02:42.140> should<00:02:42.440> do<00:02:42.680> any<00:02:42.920> type<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> mechanized<00:02:43.700> um

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
you should do any type of mechanized um

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.860 
you should do any type of mechanized um
CGI<00:02:45.709> if<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.430> look<00:02:46.550> at<00:02:46.700> abbott<00:02:47.090> are<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.630> how

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
CGI if you look at abbott are that's how

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
CGI if you look at abbott are that's how
a<00:02:48.230> mechanized<00:02:49.100> unit<00:02:49.700> should<00:02:50.060> look<00:02:50.620> okay<00:02:51.620> and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
a mechanized unit should look okay and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.650 
a mechanized unit should look okay and
that's<00:02:52.160> all<00:02:52.310> I'm<00:02:52.400> gonna<00:02:52.520> say<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:53.000> he<00:02:53.390> looks

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
that's all I'm gonna say it he looks

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.730 
that's all I'm gonna say it he looks
really<00:02:54.200> fake<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:56.720> can't<00:02:57.020> even<00:02:57.140> explain<00:02:57.350> it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
really fake and I can't even explain it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.530 
really fake and I can't even explain it
more<00:02:57.890> than<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.250> he<00:02:58.370> looked<00:02:58.580> extremely<00:02:59.060> faith

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
more than that he looked extremely faith

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.010 
more than that he looked extremely faith
but<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.709> Rhino<00:03:00.920> charging<00:03:01.700> was<00:03:01.910> perfect<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.810> I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
but the Rhino charging was perfect and I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.660 
but the Rhino charging was perfect and I
so<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.200> said<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.410> had<00:03:03.590> really<00:03:03.860> no<00:03:04.070> problems<00:03:04.550> out
