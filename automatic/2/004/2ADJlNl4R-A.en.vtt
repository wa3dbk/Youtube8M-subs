00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.180
 healthy food does not have to be boring 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.490
 let me show you some ways to 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.709
 make it even more tasty I'm your shadow 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.900
 Amen as a registered artist and when 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.639
 for people about healthy eating a 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.219
 of the things they tell me many times 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.010
 it's healthy food it 's so boring 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.710
 simple chicken simple vegetables and fish 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.140
 well it does not have to be simple I think that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.000
 people are afraid to season their meals in 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.070
 reality what happens is that we depend 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.109
 much salt and sugar to make 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.669
 that our meals are tasty and 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.590
 we really do not know what to do with the 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.800
 things that are healthy so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.510
 let me show you a couple of things 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.789
 let's start with the fruit of course 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.410
 Fruit is healthy alone I 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.539
 I think it's much more tempting to do 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 a fruit salad a thing that 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.010
 can do is a mixture will be very 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.260
 attractive to the eye and on your plate too 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.329
 the other thing that I like to do with the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.239
 fruit is to experience it a bit with 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.940
 lemon juice on just a little here 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.219
 another thing I can do is special 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.430
 its fruits I have a little nutmeg 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.380
 I'm going to place a little there convert 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.750
 something regular in something a little more 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.610
 special fucking thing that really 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.979
 like to do with the fruit is to make a dip 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.619
 of yogurt what I have in this bolt is a 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.110
 Greek yogurt without fat sweetens it a 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.240
 little with honey and added a little cinnamon 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 and he becomes an amazing guy with 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.439
 some fruits like apples can 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.280
 get an extra with the protein of 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.020
 yogurt out there of the vegetables I repeat what 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.539
 that people tend to do is just 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.799
 steaming some vegetables and not 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.619
 they put nothing 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.899
 First of all try to mix this 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.909
 carrots broccoli dish is much more 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.130
 tempting to see only a plate of 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.140
 broccoli and simple carrots but there 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.179
 more of the vegetables that can be 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.849
 do with your flavors think about the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.399
 herbs the species the lemon the garlic the 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:55.099
 tasty oils some oil 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.649
 olive a bit of sesame a little nut 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.140
 a little bit of that can really get him 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.450
 the taste of your vegetables a couple of other 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.520
 things that you can try I'm using a 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.310
 little crushed peanuts in my vegetables 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.979
 Take out the flavors and it's a fat 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.140
 healthy or if you want to add a little 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.690
 of parmesan cheese because I repeat 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.720
 has a strong flavor a little will be 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.569
 good for your vegetables cotaje the cheese 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 people love him or hate him to me really 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.040
 like with the cheese cotaje but I like 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.319
 eat the salty I think most of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.870
 people eat their cheese cotaje with fruit 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.000
 and they 've never tasted it with vegetables like this 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.400
 that here is something to prove I have a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.070
 little cucumber cut carrot chili 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.780
 red pepper and green onion and I like it 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.690
 put a spoonful of my cheese 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.120
 cotaje is so low in calories that it can 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.700
 add everything you want and placed it 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.050
 above and to get the flavor the only thing 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.080
 What is missing is a little pepper 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.959
 black and that's because the potaje cheese is 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.900
 a little salty on its own try this 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.730
 see if you like it more than with the fruit that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.100
 there is about simple chicken or fish 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.810
 simple grilled people have the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.570
 tendency to cook your chicken or your 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.970
 fish and not seasoning there is much that is 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.700
 can do with this I repeat think about 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.830
 herbs species lemon garlic 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.959
 one of the things that I like to do with 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.390
 my chicken breast is to put it on top of 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.920
 the steamed vegetables here I have a 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.319
 Spinach bed with a little 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.110
 olive oil looks good and really 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.690
 tasty the other thing with the chicken and with 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.760
 the fish is that you can marinate two if 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.819
 has that tasty marinade before 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.500
 cook your food will be even more tasty the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.110
 another thing that I like to do with my 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.140
 chicken and my fish is to put sauce 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.080
 Tomato looks really good adds 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.610
 very few calories and a lot of flavor so 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.130
 that's something that can do it more 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.300
 tempting and finally let's talk about the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.300
 integral plans 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.250
 I repeat the seasoning is the key so if 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.769
 he's cooking something with carlos pasta 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.110
 whole or here I have a couscous 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.180
 whole grains I made a video with 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 quinoa and I showed him how to cook 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.989
 quinoa using some vegetables in 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.330
 squares to add flavor and color 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.580
 that works well with any grain 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.350
 integral can do something simple 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.650
 cooking it in the broth evenly 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.019
 so that you get the taste do not be afraid 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.840
 to experiment in the kitchen this is 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.389
 something that I repeat all the time the food 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.290
 healthy can be delicious and it does not have 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.290
 to be boring
