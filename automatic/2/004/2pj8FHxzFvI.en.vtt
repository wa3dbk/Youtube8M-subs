00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you've been able to select so let's go

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.050 
you've been able to select so let's go
around<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> back<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.840> show<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> Arduino

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
around the back and show you the Arduino

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.679 
around the back and show you the Arduino
microcontroller

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.660 

so<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.499> have<00:01:58.649> an<00:01:58.740> access<00:01:59.100> door<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> back

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so we have an access door in the back

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.380 
so we have an access door in the back
here<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.659> you'll<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.549> Arduino<00:02:03.450> is

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
here and you'll see that the Arduino is

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.080 
here and you'll see that the Arduino is
right<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.459> basically<00:02:08.819> what's

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
right there and it's basically what's

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.330 
right there and it's basically what's
connecting<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.750> solenoid<00:02:10.379> valves<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> flow

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
connecting the solenoid valves the flow

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.780 
connecting the solenoid valves the flow
of<00:02:11.459> sensors<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.930> NFC<00:02:13.349> reader<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:14.640> our

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
of sensors and the NFC reader to our

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.100 
of sensors and the NFC reader to our
system<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.420> plugs<00:02:15.629> in<00:02:15.780> through<00:02:15.989> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
system and that it plugs in through the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.949 
system and that it plugs in through the
ADK<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.580> Android<00:02:18.450> tablet<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:20.540> then<00:02:21.540> we'll

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
ADK to the Android tablet and then we'll

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.309 
ADK to the Android tablet and then we'll
talk<00:02:22.110> look<00:02:22.500> at<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.739> flow<00:02:22.950> sensors<00:02:23.400> inside<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
talk look at the flow sensors inside and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.000 
talk look at the flow sensors inside and
the<00:02:25.500> solenoid<00:02:25.980> valves<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.590> two<00:02:28.799> flow

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the solenoid valves so we have two flow

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.180 
the solenoid valves so we have two flow
sensors<00:02:29.459> these<00:02:29.849> are<00:02:30.120> Swiss<00:02:30.989> flow<00:02:31.290> these<00:02:32.129> are

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
sensors these are Swiss flow these are

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.080 
sensors these are Swiss flow these are
the<00:02:32.489> Swift<00:02:32.819> Swiss<00:02:33.540> flow<00:02:33.959> 800<00:02:34.890> sf8<00:02:35.459> hundreds<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the Swift Swiss flow 800 sf8 hundreds of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.380 
the Swift Swiss flow 800 sf8 hundreds of
sensors<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.170> then<00:02:37.920> two<00:02:38.370> solenoid<00:02:39.000> valves

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
sensors and then two solenoid valves

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720 
sensors and then two solenoid valves
here<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.709> what<00:02:40.829> happens<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.280> once<00:02:41.519> you're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
here and so what happens is once you're

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280 
here and so what happens is once you're
ready<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.940> pour<00:02:42.209> beer<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.810> click<00:02:43.019> pour

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
ready to pour beer and you click pour

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.830 
ready to pour beer and you click pour
the<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.489> data<00:02:44.819> from<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.180> gets<00:02:45.360> reset<00:02:45.720> to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the the data from here gets reset to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.809 
the the data from here gets reset to
zero<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.410> then<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.010> start<00:02:47.250> pouring<00:02:47.610> by

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
zero and then you start pouring by

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.809 
zero and then you start pouring by
opening<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.329> valves<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.819> impeller

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
opening these valves and the impeller

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.080 
opening these valves and the impeller
inside<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.780> sensor<00:02:52.769> rotates<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.879> as<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
inside of the sensor rotates it as it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.849 
inside of the sensor rotates it as it
rotates<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.599> puts<00:02:54.780> out<00:02:54.930> pulses<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> count

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
rotates it puts out pulses and you count

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.190 
rotates it puts out pulses and you count
the<00:02:56.069> pulses<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.390> those<00:02:57.540> pulses<00:02:58.079> we

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
the pulses and with those pulses we

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
the pulses and with those pulses we
determine<00:03:01.200> what<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.090> flow<00:03:03.090> rate<00:03:03.299> is<00:03:03.480> or<00:03:03.660> how

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
determine what the flow rate is or how

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.839 
determine what the flow rate is or how
much<00:03:04.019> flow<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.410> gone<00:03:04.590> by<00:03:04.799> simply<00:03:05.160> kinda<00:03:05.489> pulses

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
much flow is gone by simply kinda pulses

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.490 
much flow is gone by simply kinda pulses
and<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.329> many<00:03:06.420> pulses<00:03:06.870> per<00:03:07.049> ounce<00:03:07.200> or

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and you have so many pulses per ounce or

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710 
and you have so many pulses per ounce or
so<00:03:07.650> many<00:03:07.799> pulses<00:03:08.160> per<00:03:08.310> milliliter<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.510> enough

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
so many pulses per milliliter so enough

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
so many pulses per milliliter so enough
talking<00:03:09.989> let's<00:03:10.530> demonstrate<00:03:10.760> what<00:03:11.760> this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
talking let's demonstrate what this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
talking let's demonstrate what this
wonderful<00:03:12.329> machine<00:03:12.420> does<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.829> using<00:03:14.280> my

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
cameraman today who helps me a lot with

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.069 
cameraman today who helps me a lot with
this<00:03:18.900> project<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.700> I'm<00:03:20.700> using<00:03:20.940> his<00:03:21.209> tag<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
this project and I'm using his tag and

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.390 
this project and I'm using his tag and
so<00:03:22.169> we're<00:03:22.319> gonna<00:03:22.410> authenticate<00:03:22.680> his<00:03:23.010> David

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so we're gonna authenticate his David

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.789 
so we're gonna authenticate his David
and<00:03:23.519> actually<00:03:23.790> go<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.239> get<00:03:24.299> beer<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:25.380> we

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
and actually go in and get beer so we

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.280 
and actually go in and get beer so we
scanned<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.669> badge<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.389> to<00:03:28.019> see<00:03:28.169> the
