00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.750
 Well, if there are many people we can 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.049
 have defects including physical the 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.799
 true but when there is love love 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.639
 love lasts everything wins because you 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.629
 I say this 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.759
 well then because in the next 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.949
 reflection that is called light in the 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:23.140
 darkness you will know what happened to this 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.970
 couple where one of the two had had 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.900
 a problem with your vision this is the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.900
 show of rodrÃ­guez 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.310
 and the passengers of the bus the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 they watched passively when the 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.700
 attractive young woman from white cane rose 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 carefully the steps 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 I pay the driver 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 and using your hands to perceive the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.239
 location of the seats walked by the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.470
 hallway and found the seat that according to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.940
 he had told him the state 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.670
 then be like 9 placed his briefcase on 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.440
 knees and supported the white cane 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.500
 against your land 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.280
 A year ago , 32 - year-susana 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 age had run out due to a 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 wrong diagnosis had lost of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.890
 seen and suddenly he had felt 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.570
 led to a world of dark rage and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 frustration before it had been a woman 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.040
 proudly independent now 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 Susana felt condemned by this 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.230
 terrible return of destiny to be a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.880
 impotent and helpless burden for all 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.780
 those around her 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.850
 how could this happen because it 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.280
 I complained bitterly with a full heart 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.740
 of rage 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.650
 but despite how much he could be sorry 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.090
 she knew what was the painful truth 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.100
 never again would I see a cloud of 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.190
 depression fell on the spirit of his 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.930
 blood before the optimist the single fact 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.690
 to live every day was a drama of 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.890
 frustration and fatigue I could only 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.679
 cling to her husband frames frames the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.530
 army officer and nothing to susana 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.720
 with all the heart to lose the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.850
 analyst noticed how it sank in the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.489
 depression and decided to help her 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.650
 strength and confidence 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.900
 to be independent return to the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.730
 military experience of frames had 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.400
 trained very well to handle 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.700
 delicate situations but he knew that 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 that was not the most difficult battle 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.880
 I was going to face 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.160
 finally susana felt prepared 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.100
 to go back to work but as 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.110
 I would get here before I used to drive 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.750
 car and from time to time I took the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.390
 bus but now it was too 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.960
 scared to go through the city 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.450
 yes alone marcus offered to take her in 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.400
 the car every day even when 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.730
 they worked at opposite ends of the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.580
 city at the beginning this comforted 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.340
 susan and covered the need for frames of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.570
 protect his blind wife he felt 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.210
 so insecure to perform the action more 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.010
 insignificant however frames soon 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.240
 he realized that this arrangement does not 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.100
 it would work was problematic and expensive 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.070
 Susanna will have to start taking the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.430
 bus again admitted to himself 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.970
 but he just think about mentioning what 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 it made her shiver she was still so 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.050
 fragile as full of anger as I was going to 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.440
 react 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.910
 just as Susana had planned 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.270
 horrified at the idea of taking again 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.280
 I'm blind to who you do not understand how 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.020
 I'm supposed to know where I'm going 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.920
 he said with bitterness I feel sorry 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.410
 that you are abandoning frames 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.170
 Marcos broke his heart when he heard 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.260
 these words but he knew what 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.959
 he had to do was promised to susana that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.209
 in the morning and in the evening the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.489
 would accompany on the bus all the time 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.350
 that was necessary until she 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.670
 feel 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.490
 and that was exactly what happened 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.740
 for two whole weeks frames with 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.780
 military uniform and everything accompanied 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.360
 Susana on the trip to and from 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.990
 work taught him how to lean on his 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.210
 other senses especially the ear to 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.910
 determine where they were and how 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.740
 adapting to her new environment helped her 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.810
 to meet with drivers 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.120
 who would take care of her and 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.700
 I would keep in a seat that made it 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.860
 queen even in those days not so 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.260
 good at stumbling down the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.410
 bus or looked at the briefcase full of 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.140
 papers down the hall every morning 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.770
 they made the journey together and frames 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.690
 taken a taxi to return to his office 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.330
 although this routine was more expensive and 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.430
 tired that the previous frame knew that 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.190
 it was just a matter of waiting for a 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.770
 more time before Susana was 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.920
 trained to travel by bus for his 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.400
 own account 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.320
 he believed and in the susana that he had 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.280
 known before he lost his sight 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.710
 the one that had no challenge and never 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.250
 they gave up 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.130
 finally susana decided that she was ready 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.260
 to make the attempt to travel alone 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.890
 it arrived on Monday morning and before 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.330
 leaving she hugged barkos who was her 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.280
 partner her husband and her best friend 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.940
 Her eyes were full of tears 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.260
 gratitude for that evil patience and love 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:52.590
 who had taught him they said goodbye and 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.930
 for the first time everyone took a path 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:59.360
 different 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:01.910
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.600
 every day I did very well and susana 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.240
 he never felt better he was doing 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.910
 he was going to work for his own 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.360
 count on Friday morning 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.750
 Susana took the bus as usual 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.220
 when paying the ticket the driver told him 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.800
 You'll understand that I envy you 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.009
 Susana did not know if she was talking to 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.830
 she 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.050
 after all who will envy 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.740
 a blind woman who had found the courage 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.759
 of living during the previous year 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:39.309
 intrigued asked the driver is it to me 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:43.509
 because he says that the driver envies me 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:46.479
 he answered do you know every morning 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:49.779
 during last week a gentleman of 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.689
 very good looking with military uniform has 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:54.369
 been standing at the opposite corner 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.860
 watching while you get off the 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:59.110
 bus makes sure that you cross 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.870
 well the street and watches it until 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.990
 he enters his office building then 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.939
 he throws a kiss he makes a small gesture 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.380
 of greeting and they leave 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:13.990
 you are not a woman 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.630
 tears of happiness rolled over the 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.210
 cheeks is using because although she does not 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.460
 I could see him physically there was always 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:26.419
 I felt the presence of frames 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.819
 he was lucky very lucky because he was 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.130
 had made a more powerful gift than 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.020
 the sight a gift that she does not 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.530
 I needed to see to believe in his 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.380
 existence the gift of love that can 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.639
 bring light wherever there is 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.639
 there was darkness 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.080
 the reflections of the raÃºl show toast 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.290
 helping you to be a better person every 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.290
 day
