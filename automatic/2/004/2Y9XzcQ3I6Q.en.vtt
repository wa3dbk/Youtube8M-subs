00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.200
 that people like me are ryder 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.090
 here a quickie video just for 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.460
 tell them that later I will make a 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.160
 live streaming teaching them how 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.970
 use the new tool that has 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.429
 created or pricer of the ways that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.499
 we can modify our maps as 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.359
 can see my glow head are all 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.710
 I want to teach you that kind of thing 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.060
 also how can you see here my bar 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.789
 I have all the tools 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.699
 diamond tools 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.429
 super enchanted to the maximum for example 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.399
 I'm going to hit a non-social pig here 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.379
 one trouble around here there is 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.700
 super mario who is not talking but 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.370
 I think he 's listening 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.250
 I do not know if you hear it good if you 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.650
 I hit this pig 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.370
 to see what happens 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.190
 many food stacks appear if the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.989
 I grab you all 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.989
 they will see here they are 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.560
 is very delighted that many appear 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.250
 letters and three stacks of meat and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.520
 Well, as you can see here I have games 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 the fire like this I have the spoilers I have the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.550
 portal without saying to create it and also 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.440
 something that I want to show you 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 that is pretty good even this 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.920
 block that minecraft does not exist also 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.110
 we can put it 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.520
 I'm going to put a few blocks here 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.070
 so they can see what I'm going to do with 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.390
 some maps put these blocks 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.390
 they are disappearing 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.450
 and I'm going to put the map 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.140
 and they will see that here is my image my 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.460
 channel logo because all this goes to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380
 learn to do with this new 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.390
 tool that I will be teaching in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.870
 the lighting so I hope they go over 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.330
 out there later on and more or less like 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.100
 an hour or so I will start it if 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.580
 They want to learn to do all kinds 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.070
 of things it would be good if they go through 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 the live yes or no because it's all I hope 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.950
 see them later and until later
