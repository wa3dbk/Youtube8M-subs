00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.930
 the dakar is a race that I loved and 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.750
 from the first moment I loved 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.650
 back I have passion for the face is 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.010
 obvious the names that I could win in 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.310
 motorcycle in the car are few and the truth 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.710
 a lot of respect for them to know if what 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.420
 I can do now in the car to see 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.420
 I hope it can be possible 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.800
 good because I think it's clear 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.200
 that I am one of those companies that has 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.080
 been very close to the world of 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.150
 competition that is one of the few 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.680
 besides that I've never run and that 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.629
 I have fought many times with them 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.070
 and I have been able to realize that whenever 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.350
 do some competitor do it for 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.350
 win with the same passion with the same 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.320
 seriousness professionalism 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.390
 in the same philosophy that I have I 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.949
 Here the sample has not already been 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 is history part of the history of 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.089
 the face and burgos was clear that that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.700
 I was going to be excited to try this new 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.420
 challenge one of the issues may be that 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.149
 they're going to go out a lot of times it's because 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.610
 move from two wheels to four wheels with 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:20.409
 a great brand like me was the time 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.360
 to change is something that I always go 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.100
 to remember and will always help me to 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:31.270
 progressed we called the cinema 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.920
 at least wide of exceptional nor eating 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 my friend cable 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.440
 to the team we are company there is no evolution 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.840
 of the world in the world the water the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.060
 judgments with overcoming the holes of 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.140
 pilot 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.420
 proportionate to the policy and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.590
 competitive procedures be here the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.670
 sitting in the middle of these two cars 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.239
 sure yes yes I'm a legal pilot and 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.110
 network from dakar it is because I remember 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:40.190
 these images that was small and 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.750
 some years later at my age to be 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.890
 here sitting and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.460
 imagine that now I go inside little is 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.990
 the actor and driving myself these but 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.990
 that is a dream 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.140
 here we have two cars that have won 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.920
 many years ago it is true not own 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.630
 has left the competition has been in the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.630
 world rally championship in parallel 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.569
 and later in the 24 hours of 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.650
 lemans winning the 24 hours of lemans 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.270
 keep making rally cars is 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.640
 say he has not been out of the 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.410
 competition I think it's perfect the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.680
 try to join forces to 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.900
 Trying to get a new company is 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.320
 the perfect challenge is to go and put a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 solution to a team with money 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.630
 bagged the heel when we had the necklace 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.850
 that went here goes to the Chinese style despite 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.130
 to always try to gather the best 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.380
 teams the best pilots in this case 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.110
 we also have a great sponsor like 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.680
 red bull that is a sponsor that also 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.650
 is a winning sponsor we all know that 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.450
 nothing is given in advance and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.550
 that having to work very seriously 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.280
 very hard as always there is to do 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.269
 in the motor world is what I know 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 is that I am French and 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.509
 and this race the dakar that has come out of 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.870
 paris to go to senegal in the face from 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:35.470
 For many years we have 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.660
 we have it in like in the blood and the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.500
 passion of this career and I think the 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.510
 people in the empire also beat that 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.260
 competition 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.680
 we practice the discussion so experiment 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.780
 a complete change child in a power of 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.190
 fixation exclaimed the vision of the 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.190
