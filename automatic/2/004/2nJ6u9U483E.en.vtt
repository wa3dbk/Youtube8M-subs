00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
$90 now you can see that I've already

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.450 
$90 now you can see that I've already
made<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.420> wooden<00:00:30.900> template<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.590> made<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.250> out

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
made a wooden template I made this out

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389 
made a wooden template I made this out
of<00:00:32.489> half-inch<00:00:33.440> particle<00:00:34.440> board<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> exact

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of half-inch particle board is the exact

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.720 
of half-inch particle board is the exact
same<00:00:36.020> thickness<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.469> aluminum<00:00:38.070> plate<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
same thickness as the aluminum plate and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
same thickness as the aluminum plate and
it<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.329> easiest<00:00:39.510> thing<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.260> pretty

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it was the easiest thing to make pretty

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.030 
it was the easiest thing to make pretty
precise<00:00:41.309> holes<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.629> measurements<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.530> know

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
precise holes and measurements on I know

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
precise holes and measurements on I know
this<00:00:44.489> fits<00:00:44.789> very<00:00:45.149> well<00:00:45.239> I've<00:00:46.200> already<00:00:46.410> made<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
this fits very well I've already made a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
this fits very well I've already made a
couple<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.280> changes<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.230> aluminum<00:00:49.230> plate

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
couple of changes to the aluminum plate

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.939 
couple of changes to the aluminum plate
you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> I've<00:00:50.370> cut<00:00:50.610> these<00:00:50.850> two

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
you can see that I've cut these two

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
you can see that I've cut these two
dowel<00:00:52.949> holes<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.760> where<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> dowel<00:00:54.660> pins

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
dowel holes that's where the dowel pins

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.490 
dowel holes that's where the dowel pins
are<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> bell<00:00:55.829> housing<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.969> fits<00:00:57.239> very

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
are on the bell housing and it fits very

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
are on the bell housing and it fits very
snugly<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.699> hole<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
snugly on there this hole is just so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.110 
snugly on there this hole is just so
that<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> put<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.770> spacer<00:01:02.579> plate<00:01:02.609> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that when I put that spacer plate for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
that when I put that spacer plate for
the<00:01:03.210> motor<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the motor it will go on there in the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.880 
the motor it will go on there in the
bowl<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.430> bolt<00:01:06.000> heads<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.170> room<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
bowl that a bolt heads will have room so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.670 
bowl that a bolt heads will have room so
that<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.130> won't<00:01:08.280> budge<00:01:08.720> now<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.439> said<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that they won't budge now like I said I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.100 
that they won't budge now like I said I
already<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> template<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.510> just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
already know that this template is just

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
already know that this template is just
the<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.409> size<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.430> holes<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.909> where

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the right size all the holes are where

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.620 
the right size all the holes are where
they<00:01:15.270> need<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.360> really<00:01:18.360> just

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
they need to be so right now really just

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
they need to be so right now really just
a<00:01:18.720> matter<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.280> putting<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> right

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
a matter of putting these in the right

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
a matter of putting these in the right
place<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.229> bolting<00:01:22.830> these<00:01:23.009> holes<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.490> now

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
place and bolting these holes down now

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.330 
place and bolting these holes down now
these<00:01:23.970> holes<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.780> quite<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.560> important

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
these holes are not quite as important

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.760 
these holes are not quite as important
as<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:28.409> dowel<00:01:28.860> pin<00:01:29.220> holes<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.650> they

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
as the dowel pin holes you know they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
as the dowel pin holes you know they
need<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.340> size<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.060> don't

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
need to be the right size but they don't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
need to be the right size but they don't
have<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.570> within<00:01:33.780> point<00:01:34.229> 0<00:01:34.409> 0<00:01:34.439> 1<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:35.100> inch

or anything so these are not nearly as

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.389 
or anything so these are not nearly as
important<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.790> put

line<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.860> up<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.190> little<00:02:24.340> more<00:02:24.490> carefully<00:02:25.000> and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
line it up a little more carefully and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.580 
line it up a little more carefully and
I'll<00:02:25.180> bolt<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.630> down<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.050> platform<00:02:26.290> to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
I'll bolt it down to the platform to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.460 
I'll bolt it down to the platform to
make<00:02:26.740> sure<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.040> doesn't<00:02:27.220> move<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:28.470> that's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
make sure it doesn't move but that's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.090 
make sure it doesn't move but that's
still<00:02:29.800> right<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:31.090> where<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.569> should<00:02:31.780> be<00:02:32.100> now

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
still right on where it should be now

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.160 
still right on where it should be now
that<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.430> are<00:02:33.670> mated<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.660> have<00:02:34.900> left<00:02:35.050> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
that these are mated all I have left to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.690 
that these are mated all I have left to
do<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.440> point<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.160> cut<00:02:36.370> off<00:02:36.490> some<00:02:36.520> of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
do at that point is to cut off some of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.090 
do at that point is to cut off some of
the<00:02:36.850> excess<00:02:36.880> here<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.720> might<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.740> take<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.070> to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
the excess here I might just take it to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.220 
the excess here I might just take it to
somebody<00:02:39.370> with<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> good<00:02:40.750> band<00:02:40.959> saw<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
somebody with a with a good band saw a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.479 
somebody with a with a good band saw a
plasma<00:02:41.800> cutter<00:02:41.950> because<00:02:42.250> they<00:02:42.340> could

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
plasma cutter because they could

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.710 
plasma cutter because they could
probably<00:02:42.670> whip<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.030> out<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.330> 10<00:02:43.510> minutes

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
probably whip that out in 10 minutes

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.890 
probably whip that out in 10 minutes
well<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.650> took<00:02:44.830> me<00:02:45.070> about<00:02:46.000> an<00:02:46.209> hour<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.600> cut

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
well it took me about an hour to cut

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.560 
well it took me about an hour to cut
this<00:02:47.080> out<00:02:47.290> with<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.530> handheld<00:02:47.770> jigsaw<00:02:48.570> then

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
this out with a handheld jigsaw then

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.390 
this out with a handheld jigsaw then
I'll<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> make<00:02:50.800> them<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.280> make<00:02:51.370> sure

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
I'll have to make them up and make sure

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.949 
I'll have to make them up and make sure
they're<00:02:51.670> centered<00:02:51.820> properly<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.570> we'll<00:02:52.810> come

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
they're centered properly but we'll come

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.630 
they're centered properly but we'll come
back<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.470> hopefully<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.430> you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
back to you and hopefully get you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.840 
back to you and hopefully get you

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
started so let's if I can do this with

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:22.280 
started so let's if I can do this with
one<00:03:13.780> hand

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.699 

now<00:03:23.269> check<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.420> dot<00:03:24.569> wiring<00:03:24.989> diagram<00:03:25.409> one

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
now check the dot wiring diagram one

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.099 
now check the dot wiring diagram one
more<00:03:25.950> time<00:03:26.159> just<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.909> make<00:03:27.150> sure<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
more time just to make sure it on the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.589 
more time just to make sure it on the
positive<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.450> put<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.260> next<00:03:34.620> oh<00:03:35.599> there

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
positive and put on the next oh there

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.800 
positive and put on the next oh there
she<00:03:36.870> goes<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:37.879> coupler<00:03:38.879> spins<00:03:39.180> very<00:03:39.299> well

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
she goes there coupler spins very well

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.190 
she goes there coupler spins very well
very<00:03:40.079> true<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.170 

it's<00:03:48.200> not<00:03:48.440> making<00:03:48.650> any<00:03:49.070> scraping<00:03:49.640> noises<00:03:49.880> on

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
it's not making any scraping noises on

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.690 
it's not making any scraping noises on
the<00:03:50.300> top<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.690> coupler<00:03:51.220> next<00:03:52.220> move<00:03:52.370> put<00:03:52.640> it

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
the top of the coupler next move put it

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.470 
the top of the coupler next move put it
on<00:03:52.820> here<00:03:53.000> we'll<00:03:53.180> see<00:03:53.300> how<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.480> goes<00:03:54.790> fine<00:03:55.790> go

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
on here we'll see how it goes fine go

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:18.009 
on here we'll see how it goes fine go
ahead<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.810> hook<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:56.990> up

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:30.380 

getting<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.799> little<00:04:18.949> vibration<00:04:19.819> and

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.530 

taylor<00:04:31.110> go

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
taylor go

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.840 
taylor go
alright<00:04:33.540> if<00:04:34.230> it's<00:04:34.470> right<00:04:34.770> there<00:04:35.070> then<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.640> don't

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
alright if it's right there then I don't

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.170 
alright if it's right there then I don't
get<00:04:36.000> any<00:04:36.240> vibration<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.410> very<00:04:37.770> quiet<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:39.030> all

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
get any vibration it's very quiet so all

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.180 
get any vibration it's very quiet so all
I<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.450> do<00:04:39.630> now<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.900> etched<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.740> outside

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
I have to do now is etched the outside

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.990 
I have to do now is etched the outside
of<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.930> then<00:04:43.110> that's<00:04:43.470> where<00:04:43.800> put<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:44.850> in

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
of it and then that's where put that in

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.300 
of it and then that's where put that in
place<00:04:45.270> then<00:04:45.840> I'll<00:04:45.960> both<00:04:46.140> these<00:04:46.410> holes<00:04:46.740> into<00:04:47.190> it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
place then I'll both these holes into it

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.570 
place then I'll both these holes into it
put<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.210> spacer<00:04:48.780> onto<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.380> adapter<00:04:49.890> and<00:04:50.460> it

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
put this spacer onto the adapter and it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.540 
put this spacer onto the adapter and it
should<00:04:50.760> be<00:04:50.910> very<00:04:51.210> true
