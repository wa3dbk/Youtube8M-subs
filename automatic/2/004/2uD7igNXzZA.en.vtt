00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello everyone today i'm shooting a video on 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.299
 I want a car theme with you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.470
 share a little so small 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.590
 by trick I think that 90 percent 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 motorists 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 they know shoot video for those 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 unhappy 10 percent because myself 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 once was there tell you so small 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.760
 its backstory got the right car 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 began to ride rejoice all cool and 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.719
 rather in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.520
 my first light bulb burned out 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.989
 If such a lamp in my car 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.930
 will become and she is responsible for the size and for 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.079
 fog on 2 thread it goes 2 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.879
 contact here I think it is clear but it is not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.050
 about it there is a similar plan on 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.570
 contact light bulbs 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.170
 ran the store bought immediately a couple 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.899
 bulbs think let it be 1 on the stock 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.339
 disassembled lantern tried to shove a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.270
 stick me out of course of course 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.159
 Jewish happiness has not been canceled and in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.970
 overall i got on another light bulb already 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.240
 then took 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 a pattern and the pattern I picked up 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:26.369
 what's the whole joke here you can see for the sides 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.500
 and the pimples they hold the pimples 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 our light bulb lights 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.630
 so that it will not fly away went out 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.020
 they are of several types 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.079
 that is, in this case we have one below 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.960
 one on top also come in 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.049
 one below that is one below and 2 below 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.920
 and the last option is one down one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.979
 above and they are slightly offset at an angle 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.600
 so I had to buy another one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.729
 light bulb I came home 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.020
 told his dad because 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.100
 my dad shared a secret with me 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.350
 would be upset for spending money and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.060
 how would a light bulb now not go nowhere 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.209
 need they don't fit my car 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.450
 Dad calmed me down and told me 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.190
 small secret i want with you now 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.270
 share this secret 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.390
 and so what is the whole secret of the secret we have 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.580
 the fact that here are these two bumps 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.890
 if we have 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.900
 light bulb as if with another such cap 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.000
 what we need to do to us 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.470
 you need this upper one 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 score inside 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.580
 the scale of the body to stay only 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.540
 one bottom and then when we about him 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.739
 ceiling dhow our lantern will keep 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.780
 light bulb only this one pimples 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.819
 but in principle, in principle, practice 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.010
 shows that this one too 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.480
 enough with head 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 lamp does not go away on remains 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.080
 all the time in place 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.209
 so here is my old light bulb it is very 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.080
 long worked to see the final black 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:11.150
 burned out her time came and if now 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.989
 I'll show you see, she was 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.480
 inserted on the same principle one 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.160
 pimples in place and the second is sunk in 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.250
 body 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.620
 Frankly, this light is worth it, but I'm on 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.859
 car is already two years old this is the first time 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.329
 a lamp burned behind my lantern 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:33.799
 how much is she really worth a man 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:36.799
 I don't know, so I'm trying now 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.260
 I'll try to do the same with this 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.540
 instance because he is my ceiling is not 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.609
 It fits me really worth the nose 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.640
 there should be one light bulb below one 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.329
 above and slightly angled 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.329
 Well, we try 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.830
 here we beat him if you can see yes he 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:33.840
 drowned in the body now I will put up 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:37.080
 how it will come to me like a light bulb 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.139
 my lantern goes right now 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.160
 until we turn off we are in the luggage 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.660
 branch 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.270
 I dismantled part of the rear light 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:55.229
 There is my fee, but where are they inserted? 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:58.620
 light bulbs means here's our copy on 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.590
 which we just processed 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:10.280
 hammer well then try what we have 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:14.370
 It turned out in the end, so I put a light bulb 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.550
 here she stands here I will stretch left to right 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:22.590
 that is, we are sitting normally tight 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:26.180
 nowhere is she going so slightly lower 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.560
 Well, now drop the car and turn on 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.650
 dimensions look whether it is lit or not 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.650
 after careful processing with a hammer to 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.430
 with 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:04.449
 do not pay attention to this squeaker 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.389
 reminds that we forgot to turn off 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.789
 the light when leaving the car Well 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.559
 make sure everything works like this 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.330
 little secret if to someone 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.029
 liked the video do not like 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.729
