00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 there are very good kids guys and girls 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.830
 and lovers of video games observe 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.620
 all blood you eat me also the title 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.030
 this time I'm going to teach you how to train 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.769
 strong stilt I think yes it's called 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.410
 good the military base that is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.420
 in lane county how good is the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 map of big cars 5 and blah blah but 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.510
 well you know that online gta not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 can be as in gta iv individual of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.840
 that you are approaching the main door 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.300
 and the fences are opened and then they leave you 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.490
 happen and you can not do that in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 line neither at the airport nor there so 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.930
 good how are you seeing is this time 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790
 I'm going to show you different ways of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.160
 how to get in, whether it's away from there 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.230
 or being exactly close to the same 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 surroundings of this base so good 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.660
 let's start with the first mode of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.880
 get in 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.650
 the first mode consists in entering by the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.390
 air is too simple and there are 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.790
 many talking about an idea maybe already what 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 have tried others but good can 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.570
 find aircraft in 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.700
 where is the aerodrome of trevor the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.460
 aerodrome that is close good going on 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.600
 the lake that is near the house of 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.720
 fear at the airport and near the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.130
 airport as a kind of from 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.570
 helicopter probe that you can 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.619
 buy in the single mode that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.259
 also there they will be landing 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.759
 propaganda helicopters and so on 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.190
 that good here also appear 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.050
 helicopters like the cargo bob and then 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.000
 the normal two planes do not appear 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.650
 jets and well I do not know what the problem is 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.119
 because they do not look like jets and so on but 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 Well some friends told me that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.690
 depending on your level are the vehicles 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.030
 that appear on the map that are being 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.979
 generating and others for example before 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.539
 when he started playing, the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.890
 cargo back and helicopters appeared 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.100
 simple helicopter police 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.050
 of paramedic firefighters and others 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.910
 but in some strange way going up 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.200
 level and playing alone they started to 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.130
 appear there are things I do not know if 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.050
 have been in accordance with 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.250
 updates or others but good that 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.890
 It's a small tip that I'm going to give you 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.690
 well we are approaching directly to the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.369
 base we landed with the largest 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.260
 caution as possible when 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.120
 flying almost never you 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.770
 they start to chase you from 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's almost always when you start 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.330
 touch ground and get off so good 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 we're going to have to need ammunition maybe 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.680
 a submachine gun to shoot from 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.240
 away because there are going to be a few 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
 military men out there giving rondines and 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.490
 caring and others and well we already located the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.560
 dodgers that are like you are little parcelitas 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.970
 and so there is one at the airfield ay 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 it's not close to betting 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.620
 turning over the base 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.630
 identify your goal and already land 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 directly there and remember with 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.740
 the maximum possible precaution because 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.630
 can explode can hit something and 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.330
 others so good and once done 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.670
 this mission completed 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.430
 mode number 2 to start this 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.200
 strong is that good almost always 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.210
 we failed in the first attempts when 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.950
 we are trying to do we study ourselves 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.740
 as I tell you, we explode and others 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.750
 they kill simply we do not arrive or by 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.250
 any reason but good we die 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.110
 near this area we will prefer 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.750
 these surroundings what we have to 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.760
 to do is go to this section of the map 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.170
 this part that I'm indicating that good 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.060
 is a part at the top of 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.010
 the base seeing it horizontally and 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.570
 good is this area that is like 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.490
 a little circle blah blah good are going to see 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.170
 different types of vehicles 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.209
 I will continue giving options and others 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.440
 well here we are going to take this time the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.810
 which of motorbike 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.330
 we are going to take flight and we are going to enter 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.160
 this area once entering we will have 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.080
 sometimes we will enter directly with 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.670
 With the greatest style we are going to make a 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.890
 good debt pe and others we will fall well 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.930
 but most of the time we're going to spend 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.209
 what will happen to me just happened in 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.040
 this good moment we recover the motorcycle 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.870
 maybe there are times that die because 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.520
 I happened to record this that I died several 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.709
 times but good they will appear here 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.209
 close and do the same once entering 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.440
 with the motor issue we enter everything 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.210
 right down the hall 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.760
 they will detect us until we enter 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.950
 directly to the area that is inhabited 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.290
 for military and good there 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.270
 we enter we turn in the first 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.860
 door that we see then then you 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.450
 identify and turn left 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.310
 immediately because to the right side 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.870
 they always go to see military and vehicles 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.520
 they're going to start shooting you and 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.890
 possibly die since maybe we 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.180
 make your bulletproof vest once done 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.060
 this we continue to the left we give 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.860
 turn right before bumping into 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.810
 the parking lot we follow everything right 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.640
 almost until we hit the wall we turn 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.470
 right on the fences and into 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.049
 the track we already selected our 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.000
 goal as always and we got on and 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.380
 well how are you seeing many appear 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.640
 species of birds and gloves tilling 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.010
 better or as it is called but they are airplanes 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.990
 great how good I call them and I still 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.970
 previous because they look too 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.710
 but good as I was saying that I 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.750
 they say your level depends on what they are 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.370
 vehicles that are generated to me are also not 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.020
 tanks appeared here but now 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.090
 the tanks are also being generated and 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.550
 are sometimes generating these aircraft 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.770
 big and the jets are always going to 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.170
 generate so good can I take a 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.370
 tank and others and try to get out of there 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.750
 but good the tanks I do not know how 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.880
 get them out that I will also tell 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.700
 in the end 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.050
 well we already take our objective and 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.050
 we went out shitting milk from there 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.740
 the number three and for me the one that got me 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.450
 makes a part of the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.310
 plane and others it's easy 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.840
 also and practical since it is good that 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.980
 well whenever we come with friends here 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.330
 we die and so on 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.370
 well then we return to the area where 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.440
 with we found the ATV and will see 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.360
 a kind of transport truck 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.100
 The military is not always generated 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.840
 good that can ward off some 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.790
 return instantly they turn to 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.040
 load the vehicles that there are plus four 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.450
 motorcycles and other good because we take it and what 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.240
 we take to this position that are 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.710
 seeing is in the bottom by 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.630
 where they are generated almost always 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.580
 like a kind of pantanillo out there 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.680
 they have it that seasonal also in the 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.500
 map and then you will locate it in this part 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.480
 there are different walls around the fort 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.160
 temporary which can separate but I 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.260
 I recommend 100% of this one since it is 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.580
 near the track and they can be running 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.950
 what is he going to do next 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.600
 and also in the video we entered taking 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.310
 and we beat the military we shot them 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.500
 a few that bother us we take what 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.240
 what do we need and we go so 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.340
 well then those are the little ones 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.650
 tips that I can give you and well now if 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.980
 the advice that I brought them I do not know if it 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.630
 you can with the position I get the tank d 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.640
 the military zone since it would be a pass 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.780
 but you have to be too careful of 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.390
 that the other tanks are 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.520
 shooting the jets and so on so if 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.140
 someone can do this I do not know that I 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.150
 leave in the comments if you can or 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.330
 I will not be trying it maybe 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.530
 rise in the week and nothing then I hope 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.550
 that he liked this little 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.890
 video do not forget to jail and 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.480
 share it with friends subscribe to 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.860
 more videos of grand theft auto not on 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.720
 a photo but of the whole world of 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.650
 videogames greetings and see you up 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.650
 the following diaries 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.010
 and
