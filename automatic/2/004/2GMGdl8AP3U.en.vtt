00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
of the limitations though was the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.420 
of the limitations though was the
homebrew<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.470> limited<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.920> size<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.309> can

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

homebrew was limited in size you can
only<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.700> homebrew<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.210> because<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.450> 700

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
only do homebrew up because like 700

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.380 
only do homebrew up because like 700
makes<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.260> something<00:00:34.620> yeah<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
makes or something yeah and it was it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.180 
makes or something yeah and it was it
was<00:00:36.450> awkward<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> crazy<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:38.100> actually

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
was awkward and crazy and it's actually

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.639 
was awkward and crazy and it's actually
really<00:00:38.489> good<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.120> device<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
really good use for a device that

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
really good use for a device that
frankly<00:00:40.649> didn't<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.399> catch<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
frankly didn't really catch on right and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
frankly didn't really catch on right and
one<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> problems<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> games

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
one of the problems is not all the games

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
one of the problems is not all the games
are<00:00:44.579> available<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> PSP<00:00:46.200> for

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
are available that are on the PSP for

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
are available that are on the PSP for
the<00:00:46.559> PSP<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.789> why<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.960> hack

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the PSP go which is why you have to hack

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
the PSP go which is why you have to hack
it<00:00:49.410> right<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> hack<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.719> can

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it right so if you hack it you can

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
it right so if you hack it you can
install<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.230> custom<00:00:52.410> firmware<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.070> allows
