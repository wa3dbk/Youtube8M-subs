started<00:00:19.260> doing<00:00:19.529> cancer<00:00:19.890> medicine<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.670> all

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
started doing cancer medicine it was all

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.540 
started doing cancer medicine it was all
about<00:00:20.970> doctors<00:00:21.930> opinions<00:00:22.320> his<00:00:22.800> opinion<00:00:23.369> based

and using evidence-based medicine from
making<00:00:34.620> decisions<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
making decisions so we have the
