very<00:00:07.420> often<00:00:07.960> and<00:00:08.670> different<00:00:09.670> people<00:00:09.730> have

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
very often and different people have

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.910 
very often and different people have
different<00:00:10.120> philosophies<00:00:10.510> about<00:00:10.960> it<00:00:11.380> but<00:00:11.620> if

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
different philosophies about it but if

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.820 
different philosophies about it but if
I'm<00:00:12.430> having<00:00:13.000> adding<00:00:13.390> experience<00:00:13.900> with<00:00:14.170> my

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
I'm having adding experience with my

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.640 
I'm having adding experience with my
splices<00:00:15.730> causing<00:00:16.119> any<00:00:16.240> problem<00:00:16.630> i'll<00:00:17.170> put<00:00:17.529> the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
splices causing any problem i'll put the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.800 
splices causing any problem i'll put the
center<00:00:17.980> of<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.160> plate<00:00:18.369> over<00:00:18.609> that<00:00:18.849> splice<00:00:19.570> i

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
center of the plate over that splice i

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.920 
center of the plate over that splice i
made<00:00:20.050> so<00:00:20.410> that<00:00:20.440> the<00:00:20.710> ends<00:00:21.190> are<00:00:21.430> not<00:00:22.360> anywhere

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
made so that the ends are not anywhere

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.430 
made so that the ends are not anywhere
near<00:00:22.990> the<00:00:23.830> end<00:00:24.039> of<00:00:24.250> ass<00:00:24.430> of<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.240> tape<00:00:25.449> causing

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
near the end of ass of the tape causing

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.950 
near the end of ass of the tape causing
the<00:00:26.560> tape<00:00:26.770> to<00:00:27.010> lift<00:00:27.190> up<00:00:27.340> as<00:00:27.490> well<00:00:27.670> that<00:00:28.600> depends

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
the tape to lift up as well that depends

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.330 
the tape to lift up as well that depends
on<00:00:29.109> how<00:00:29.260> you<00:00:29.289> want<00:00:29.440> to<00:00:29.680> do<00:00:29.800> it<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.070> how<00:00:30.160> good

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
on how you want to do it and how good

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.740 
on how you want to do it and how good
your<00:00:30.520> splices<00:00:31.029> are<00:00:31.180> but<00:00:31.330> that's<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.570> way<00:00:31.660> I'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
your splices are but that's the way I'm

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.810 
your splices are but that's the way I'm
going<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:32.020> do<00:00:32.169> it<00:00:32.259> for<00:00:32.320> this<00:00:32.489> illustration<00:00:33.489> or

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
going to do it for this illustration or

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.389 
going to do it for this illustration or
i<00:00:34.120> can<00:00:34.629> just<00:00:34.780> offset<00:00:35.409> it<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.589> little<00:00:35.739> bit<00:00:35.920> watch

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
i can just offset it a little bit watch

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:47.879 
i can just offset it a little bit watch
mm-hmm<00:00:37.210> in<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.050> next<00:00:38.199> trip<00:00:46.409> now<00:00:47.409> here's<00:00:47.679> my

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:47.889 
mm-hmm in the next trip now here's my

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:50.789 
mm-hmm in the next trip now here's my
there's<00:00:48.819> a<00:00:48.999> cut<00:00:49.179> i<00:00:49.210> made<00:00:49.539> so<00:00:50.170> let's<00:00:50.350> say<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.530> want

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
there's a cut i made so let's say I want

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.559 
there's a cut i made so let's say I want
the<00:00:50.889> center<00:00:51.219> of<00:00:51.249> the<00:00:51.460> plate<00:00:51.699> to<00:00:52.299> scar

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
the center of the plate to scar

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.989 
the center of the plate to scar
somewhere<00:00:52.929> around<00:00:53.170> here<00:00:53.609> so<00:00:54.609> that<00:00:54.789> when<00:00:54.969> I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
somewhere around here so that when I

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.079 
somewhere around here so that when I
come<00:00:55.389> around<00:00:55.829> I've<00:00:56.829> covered<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.429> splice<00:00:57.789> and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
come around I've covered that splice and

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.349 
come around I've covered that splice and
I<00:00:58.299> have<00:00:58.539> no<00:00:59.019> gap<00:00:59.409> hear<00:00:59.859> that<00:01:00.429> a<00:01:00.459> lot<00:01:00.549> of<00:01:00.909> solvent

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
I have no gap hear that a lot of solvent

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.819 
I have no gap hear that a lot of solvent
or<00:01:01.479> anything<00:01:01.809> again<00:01:02.049> okay<00:01:02.440> let's<00:01:02.679> say<00:01:02.799> I

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
or anything again okay let's say I

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.680 
or anything again okay let's say I
wanted<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.190> do<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.339> let's<00:01:04.180> say<00:01:04.330> I'm<00:01:04.420> going<00:01:04.570> to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
wanted to do that let's say I'm going to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.160 
wanted to do that let's say I'm going to
use<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:06.460> fly<00:01:07.000> my<00:01:07.300> hair<00:01:07.510> as<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> reference<00:01:08.050> I

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
use this fly my hair as a reference I

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.750 
use this fly my hair as a reference I
see<00:01:08.380> there's<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.650> nice<00:01:08.890> horizontal<00:01:09.190> line

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
see there's a nice horizontal line

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.710 
see there's a nice horizontal line
already

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020 

you<00:01:16.720> will<00:01:16.930> find<00:01:17.170> any<00:01:17.470> reference<00:01:17.770> marks<00:01:18.460> on

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
you will find any reference marks on

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.499 
you will find any reference marks on
this<00:01:19.420> particular<00:01:19.659> plate<00:01:20.320> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.450> will

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
this particular plate I think that will

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.960 
this particular plate I think that will
be<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.689> good<00:01:22.899> reference<00:01:23.259> mark<00:01:23.680> 1<00:01:24.399> assume<00:01:24.729> that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
be a good reference mark 1 assume that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.569 
be a good reference mark 1 assume that
that<00:01:25.119> line<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.600> horizontal<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.619> hopefully

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
that line is horizontal and hopefully

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.520 
that line is horizontal and hopefully
it's<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.759> horizontal<00:01:28.240> on<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.420> artwork<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.990> very

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
it's a horizontal on the artwork a very

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's a horizontal on the artwork a very
often<00:01:30.070> you'll<00:01:30.729> have<00:01:30.970> little<00:01:31.360> tick<00:01:31.659> marks

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
often you'll have little tick marks

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.429 
often you'll have little tick marks
there<00:01:33.100> they<00:01:33.310> are<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.729> see<00:01:34.119> now<00:01:34.390> okay<00:01:35.049> I've<00:01:35.229> got

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
there they are I see now okay I've got

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.050 
there they are I see now okay I've got
my<00:01:35.619> little<00:01:35.799> register<00:01:36.340> mark<00:01:36.580> so<00:01:36.789> that<00:01:36.939> I<00:01:37.000> can

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
my little register mark so that I can

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.419 
my little register mark so that I can
see<00:01:37.299> across<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.600> plate<00:01:37.869> now<00:01:37.990> some<00:01:38.229> people

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
see across the plate now some people

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:45.690 
see across the plate now some people
will<00:01:39.429> take<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:40.000> ruler<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.979> go<00:01:44.979> across<00:01:45.310> those

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
will take a ruler and go across those

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.580 
will take a ruler and go across those
two<00:01:46.030> marks<00:01:46.450> meet<00:01:46.869> in<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.140> center<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
two marks meet in the center of the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.740 
two marks meet in the center of the
plate<00:01:47.799> or<00:01:47.950> wherever<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.459> and<00:01:48.759> make<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.509> line

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
plate or wherever it is and make a line

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.809 
plate or wherever it is and make a line
across<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.289> plane<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.649> don't<00:01:51.399> know<00:01:51.580> that<00:01:51.789> I

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
across the plane I don't know that I

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.940 
across the plane I don't know that I
like<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.179> do<00:01:52.299> that<00:01:52.450> because<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:53.110> can<00:01:53.530> see<00:01:53.770> those

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
like to do that because I can see those

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550 
like to do that because I can see those
marks<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.610> if<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.090> do<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.270> line<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:55.840> line<00:01:56.259> might

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
marks and if I do a line that line might

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320 
marks and if I do a line that line might
not<00:01:56.740> be<00:01:56.890> perfectly<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.549> those<00:01:57.759> marks<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.179> if<00:01:58.270> i

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
not be perfectly on those marks so if i

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.289 
not be perfectly on those marks so if i
go<00:01:58.360> about<00:01:58.539> adam<00:01:58.899> at<00:01:59.170> keep<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.709> keep<00:02:00.459> propagating

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
go about adam at keep I keep propagating

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.300 
go about adam at keep I keep propagating
the<00:02:01.450> error<00:02:01.689> everytime<00:02:02.140> i<00:02:02.409> do<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.220> I'm

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
the error everytime i do that so I'm

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.130 
the error everytime i do that so I'm
going<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.789> going<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.360> refer<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.750> those

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
to be doing checks to see how parallel I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.270 
to be doing checks to see how parallel I
was<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.660> make<00:02:22.810> adjustments<00:02:22.959> from<00:02:23.470> there<00:02:23.739> how

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to reposition it if I took this mining

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
to reposition it if I took this mining
tape<00:02:33.940> completely<00:02:34.510> off<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.660> cylinder<00:02:35.109> right

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
tape completely off the cylinder right

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.190 
tape completely off the cylinder right
now<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.769> mount<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:36.970> reposition<00:02:37.720> monetary

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
now and mount it and reposition monetary

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.900 
now and mount it and reposition monetary
positions<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.459> very<00:02:39.670> difficult

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
positions going to be very difficult

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.400 
positions going to be very difficult
it's<00:02:40.420> probably<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> mess<00:02:40.989> up<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.200> tape

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
it's probably going to mess up the tape

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.740 
it's probably going to mess up the tape
or<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> plate<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.069> both<00:02:42.359> so<00:02:43.359> what<00:02:43.480> I'm<00:02:43.569> going

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750

to do is I'm going to cut a narrow strip
out<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:45.850> then<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.440> narrow<00:02:47.829> strip<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.549> the

out and then that narrow strip is the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.610 
out and then that narrow strip is the
only<00:02:49.000> thing<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.569> only<00:02:49.630> tacky<00:02:50.049> portion<00:02:50.530> I'm

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
they're not good can continue reposition

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.770 
they're not good can continue reposition
until<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.340> feel<00:04:09.549> pretty<00:04:09.730> good<00:04:09.879> about<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.150> before

the tape at that point but again is a

tackle see this that's a better one and

tackle see this that's a better one and
what<00:04:52.910> I'll<00:04:53.000> do<00:04:53.120> now<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.410> remark<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.620> black

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
what I'll do now is remark that black

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:01.060 
what I'll do now is remark that black
line<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:59.330> that<00:05:00.050> just<00:05:00.290> because<00:05:00.560> it's<00:05:00.710> our<00:05:00.830> rule

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
line and that just because it's our rule

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.140 
line and that just because it's our rule
of<00:05:01.190> those<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.370> mean<00:05:01.520> it's<00:05:01.640> perfectly<00:05:04.150> parallel

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
of those I mean it's perfectly parallel

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.570 
of those I mean it's perfectly parallel
to<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.720> axis<00:05:06.230> of<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.440> cylinder<00:05:06.650> so<00:05:07.130> that

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
to the axis of the cylinder so that

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.800 
to the axis of the cylinder so that
might<00:05:07.730> be<00:05:07.760> another<00:05:07.880> reason<00:05:08.210> even<00:05:08.420> if<00:05:08.570> you<00:05:08.690> get

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
might be another reason even if you get

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.660 
might be another reason even if you get
it<00:05:08.900> right<00:05:09.020> you'll<00:05:09.260> need<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.590> reposition<00:05:09.830> we'll

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
it right you'll need to reposition we'll

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.610 
it right you'll need to reposition we'll
see<00:05:10.820> all<00:05:11.510> right<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:12.230> I'm<00:05:12.290> going<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.500> position

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
see all right so I'm going to position

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.130 
see all right so I'm going to position
this<00:05:13.010> here<00:05:16.120> I'm<00:05:17.120> looking<00:05:17.270> at<00:05:17.480> my<00:05:17.720> reference

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
this here I'm looking at my reference

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.560 
this here I'm looking at my reference
