00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
weight because the foods he was eating

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.660 
weight because the foods he was eating
were<00:00:48.030> super<00:00:48.809> high<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.350> calories<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:49.890> super

were super high in calories but super
low<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.239> nutrients<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.469> created<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
low in nutrients and this created that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
low in nutrients and this created that
false<00:00:53.550> sense<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.149> hunger<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.840> always

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
false sense of hunger that was always

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
false sense of hunger that was always
with<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> caused<00:00:56.309> him<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> have

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
Keith and why it happens to you you see

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.810 
Keith and why it happens to you you see
you<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.479> complex<00:01:07.520> chemical<00:01:08.520> receptors

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you have very complex chemical receptors

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.210 
you have very complex chemical receptors
in<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.299> body<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.799> complex

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
in your body some of the more complex

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.520 
in your body some of the more complex
ones<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.670> far<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:12.000> diet<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.960> nutrition<00:01:13.409> are

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ones as far as diet and nutrition are

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
ones as far as diet and nutrition are
concerned<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.340> found<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:14.820> small

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
concerned are found in your small

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.410 
concerned are found in your small
intestines<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.369> receptors<00:01:18.000> read

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
intestines now what these receptors read

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.429 
intestines now what these receptors read
is<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.439> much<00:01:19.740> nutrients<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.729> taking<00:01:21.150> in

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
is how much nutrients you are taking in

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.130 
is how much nutrients you are taking in
so<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:22.979> taking<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.640> low<00:01:24.360> nutrient

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so if you're taking in low nutrient

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.039 
so if you're taking in low nutrient
foods<00:01:25.430> these<00:01:26.430> receptors<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.330> picking<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
foods these receptors are picking that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.609 
foods these receptors are picking that
up<00:01:28.110> their<00:01:29.070> job<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> report<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
up their job then is to report to the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
up their job then is to report to the
hypothalamus<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:32.729> brain<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> tell<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
hypothalamus of your brain and tell you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.609 
hypothalamus of your brain and tell you
when<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.549> crave<00:01:36.090> foods<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.869> increase<00:01:37.439> your

hunger so eating a low nutrient diet is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.389 
hunger so eating a low nutrient diet is
going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.299> send<00:01:42.630> signals<00:01:43.350> constantly<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.280> to

going to send signals constantly up to

your brain that says send more food

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.469 
your brain that says send more food
trigger<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> hunger<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.000> trigger<00:01:48.329> the
