00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
so my name is Dustin I do some different

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.120 
so my name is Dustin I do some different
drums<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.940> loops<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.110> percussion<00:00:10.530> tees<00:00:10.710> and

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
drums and loops and percussion tees and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
drums and loops and percussion tees and
so<00:00:11.340> I'm<00:00:11.670> gonna<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:12.000> running<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.420> few<00:00:12.630> different

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
so I'm gonna be running a few different

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.930 
so I'm gonna be running a few different
analog<00:00:13.500> drum<00:00:13.679> machines<00:00:14.070> through<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> descent

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
analog drum machines through the descent

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.970 
analog drum machines through the descent
as<00:00:15.150> well<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.509> talking<00:00:15.750> through<00:00:16.080> how<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> set<00:00:16.859> it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
as well as talking through how to set it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.609 
as well as talking through how to set it
up<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.480> brienne<00:00:18.480> device<00:00:18.810> almost<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
up as a brienne device almost like a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.650 
up as a brienne device almost like a
plug-in<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.340> analogue<00:00:21.240> outboard

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
plug-in or an analogue outboard

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.679 
plug-in or an analogue outboard
affecting<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> da<00:00:22.710> W<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.330> I'll<00:00:24.420> start

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
affecting the da W so but I'll start

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.230 
affecting the da W so but I'll start
first<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.310> analog<00:00:26.310> drum<00:00:26.490> machine<00:00:26.910> where

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
first with the analog drum machine where

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
first with the analog drum machine where
I've<00:00:27.960> got<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> church<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.640> using

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
I've got a one of the church with using

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540 
I've got a one of the church with using
any<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.480> time-based<00:00:31.320> thing<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.859> drum

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
any kind of time-based thing with drum

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
any kind of time-based thing with drum
machines<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.090> getting<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> time<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.079> lock<00:00:34.230> up

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
machines is getting the time to lock up

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
machines is getting the time to lock up
and<00:00:34.620> synch<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.340> I've<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.610> saved

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and synch up and so I've actually saved

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.840 
and synch up and so I've actually saved
a<00:00:36.059> preset<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> pre-delay<00:00:38.040> control<00:00:38.700> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
a preset that the pre-delay control on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670 
a preset that the pre-delay control on
the<00:00:38.940> reader<00:00:39.149> time<00:00:39.510> when<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the reader time when you have it in the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.950 
the reader time when you have it in the
reverse<00:00:40.890> mode<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> descent<00:00:41.969> Weaver<00:00:42.780> time

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
reverse mode or the descent Weaver time

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
reverse mode or the descent Weaver time
acts<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> pre<00:00:43.680> delay<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.489> gives<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> kind

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
acts as a pre delay which gives you kind

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.709 
acts as a pre delay which gives you kind
of<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.210> time<00:00:45.450> factor<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> responds

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
of your time factor in how it responds

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
of your time factor in how it responds
through<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> sound<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.730> just

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
through the sound so these are just

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.389 
through the sound so these are just
analog<00:00:51.570> drum<00:00:51.750> machine<00:00:52.110> sounds<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.800> by

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
analog drum machine sounds that by

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:02.150 
analog drum machine sounds that by
themselves<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.000> sound<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
themselves just sound you see with the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860 
themselves just sound you see with the
short<00:01:02.399> reverb<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> pre-delay

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
short reverb time with the pre-delay

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.090 
short reverb time with the pre-delay
being<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> short<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.530> gives<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> time

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
being that short it gives it a time

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.450 
being that short it gives it a time
factor<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.549> little<00:01:05.700> bit<00:01:06.979> much<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> delay

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
factor a little bit much like a delay

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.910 
factor a little bit much like a delay
with<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.909> slapback<00:01:09.390> echo<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
with your slapback echo but one of the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
with your slapback echo but one of the
cool<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.670> found<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.420> mountain

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
cool things they found out at mountain

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.030 
cool things they found out at mountain
accident<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.590> when<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> play<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
accident is actually when you play a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.289 
accident is actually when you play a
loop<00:01:14.509> with<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.350> reverse<00:01:16.650> delay<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
loop with the reverse delay on and you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.060 
loop with the reverse delay on and you
start<00:01:18.450> messing<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> reverb<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.619> when

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
start messing with the reverb time when

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.899 
start messing with the reverb time when
the<00:01:20.159> loop<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.460> mostly<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> wet<00:01:21.299> mix<00:01:21.570> area

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
the loop is mostly in the wet mix area

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.950 
the loop is mostly in the wet mix area
so<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:24.060> hearing<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> nice<00:01:24.659> little

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so you're hearing that nice little

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
so you're hearing that nice little
reverse<00:01:25.290> thing<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> mess<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
reverse thing when you mess with the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.990 
reverse thing when you mess with the
reverb<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> creates<00:01:27.930> sort<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> DJ

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
reverb time it creates sort of a DJ

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.060 
reverb time it creates sort of a DJ
speed-up<00:01:30.000> slowdown<00:01:30.030> effect<00:01:30.869> here

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.109 

when<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.159> pull<00:01:37.340> down<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.520> River<00:01:37.820> time<00:01:38.000> to

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
when you pull down that River time to

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.149 
when you pull down that River time to
shorten<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:39.140> speeds<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.829> makes<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.070> a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
shorten it speeds it up and makes it a

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.660 
shorten it speeds it up and makes it a
little<00:01:40.340> higher<00:01:40.520> pitch<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:42.049> if<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.460> lengthen

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.910 

it<00:01:46.670> gives<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.170> speed<00:01:48.170> up<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.409> slow<00:01:48.560> down<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
it gives you speed up and slow down the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.999 
it gives you speed up and slow down the
facts<00:01:49.130> there<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.899> course<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.470> little<00:01:51.890> bit

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
facts there and of course a little bit

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.740 
facts there and of course a little bit
of<00:01:52.159> tone<00:01:52.369> control<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:53.060> week<00:01:58.360> usually<00:01:59.360> deal

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
of tone control this week usually deal

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.219 
of tone control this week usually deal
with<00:01:59.899> their<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.509> that's<00:02:02.630> kind<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.990> funny

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
with their so that's kind of a funny

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.830 
with their so that's kind of a funny
defect<00:02:03.619> where<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.799> loop<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.100> actually<00:02:04.490> going

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
defect where the loop is actually going

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:15.180 
defect where the loop is actually going
and<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.929> can<00:02:06.110> hear<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:13.549> dry<00:02:13.790> comes<00:02:14.060> back<00:02:14.299> in

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and you can hear the dry comes back in

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.949 
and you can hear the dry comes back in
get<00:02:16.190> more<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.579> delay<00:02:16.910> kind<00:02:17.599> of<00:02:17.690> effect

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
get more of the delay kind of effect

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.210 
get more of the delay kind of effect
that<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.140> need<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> first<00:02:18.650> I've

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
that you need for the first I've

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.910 
that you need for the first I've
actually<00:02:19.370> saved<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.940> preset<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.510> here<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:21.769> my

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
actually saved a preset on here on my

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.370 
actually saved a preset on here on my
red<00:02:22.160> that's<00:02:22.459> timed<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> tempo<00:02:24.049> that<00:02:24.079> we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
red that's timed to the tempo that we're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.949 
red that's timed to the tempo that we're
at<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:24.829> which<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.069> about<00:02:25.250> 100<00:02:25.579> BPM<00:02:26.000> so

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
at on here which is about 100 BPM so

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.500 
at on here which is about 100 BPM so
that<00:02:27.110> now

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.050 

I<00:02:33.769> get<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:35.190> bit<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.550> same<00:02:35.760> kind<00:02:36.030> of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I get a little bit of the same kind of

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.930 
I get a little bit of the same kind of
tip<00:02:36.239> goes<00:02:36.390> back<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:41.610> sink<00:02:41.790> these

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
tip goes back to just sink these

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.800 
tip goes back to just sink these
together<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.629> drama<00:02:42.870> show<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.569> kind

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
together the drama show so that's kind

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.009 
together the drama show so that's kind
of<00:02:45.840> one<00:02:46.049> fun<00:02:46.349> effect<00:02:47.099> here<00:02:47.340> we've<00:02:47.610> got<00:02:48.019> the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
of one fun effect here we've got the

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.320 
of one fun effect here we've got the
next<00:02:49.409> would<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.560> kind<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.519> what<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.849> might<00:02:51.030> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
next would be kind of what you might you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
next would be kind of what you might you
know<00:02:51.450> sit<00:02:51.690> down<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.230> typically<00:02:52.920> try

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
know sit down with and typically try

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.500 
know sit down with and typically try
which<00:02:53.489> would<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.790> actually<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.150> playing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
which would be actually just playing

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.770 
which would be actually just playing
single<00:02:54.930> shot<00:02:55.170> sounds<00:02:56.299> you're<00:02:57.299> trying<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.599> pull

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
single shot sounds you're trying to pull

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.500 
single shot sounds you're trying to pull
some<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.379> cool<00:02:58.560> space<00:02:58.830> around<00:02:59.129> those<00:02:59.510> now

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
some kind of cool space around those now

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.140 
some kind of cool space around those now
because<00:03:00.870> you've<00:03:01.079> got<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.650> little<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:02.909> pitch

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
because you've got a little bit of pitch

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.300 
because you've got a little bit of pitch
control<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> kick<00:03:04.049> one<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.860> things<00:03:05.099> on

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
control of the kick one of the things on

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.880 
control of the kick one of the things on
the<00:03:05.430> shimmer<00:03:05.670> preset<00:03:06.590> dialing<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.709> some

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
the shimmer preset dialing in some

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.440 
the shimmer preset dialing in some
octaves<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.519> too<00:03:08.670> as<00:03:08.819> well<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> think

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
octaves on there too as well I think

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.380 
octaves on there too as well I think
it's<00:03:09.569> on<00:03:09.660> my<00:03:09.780> blue<00:03:10.140> crusade<00:03:10.560> here<00:03:11.180> I've<00:03:12.180> got

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's on my blue crusade here I've got

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.180 
it's on my blue crusade here I've got
this

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.320 

very<00:03:18.700> large<00:03:19.290> kind<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.410> self<00:03:20.680> oscillating<00:03:21.400> fan

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
very large kind of self oscillating fan

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.260 
very large kind of self oscillating fan
going<00:03:22.600> on<00:03:22.750> where<00:03:22.990> my<00:03:23.140> diminish<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.860> high<00:03:24.270> my

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
going on where my diminish is so high my

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.060 
going on where my diminish is so high my
River<00:03:25.540> time<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.080> high<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.710> they<00:03:26.830> actually

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
River time is so high but they actually

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.830 
River time is so high but they actually
just<00:03:27.190> feedback<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> little<00:03:28.000> bit<00:03:28.120> by<00:03:28.270> themselves

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
just feedback a little bit by themselves

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.900 
just feedback a little bit by themselves
I<00:03:29.020> just<00:03:29.500> leave<00:03:29.650> them<00:03:29.740> up<00:03:29.920> which<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.700> kind<00:03:30.820> of

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
I just leave them up which is kind of

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.350 
I just leave them up which is kind of
nice<00:03:32.580> but<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.670> thing<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.880> remember<00:03:33.970> is

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
nice but the thing to remember is

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.910 
nice but the thing to remember is
because<00:03:34.510> I've<00:03:34.750> got<00:03:34.900> these<00:03:35.050> octaves<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.620> here

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
because I've got these octaves on here

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.980 
because I've got these octaves on here
let's<00:03:36.280> play<00:03:36.460> an<00:03:36.640> octave<00:03:36.760> below<00:03:36.970> about<00:03:37.570> my<00:03:37.750> kick

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
let's play an octave below about my kick

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.430 
let's play an octave below about my kick
here<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:38.440> just<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:39.340> low<00:03:39.490> octave<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.350> a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
here so just the low octave it's just a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.040 
here so just the low octave it's just a
little<00:03:41.710> extra<00:03:41.980> layer<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.280> sub<00:03:42.870> that's<00:03:43.870> in

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
little extra layer of sub that's in

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
little extra layer of sub that's in
there<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:48.120> especially<00:03:49.120> feeds<00:03:49.360> into<00:03:49.570> our

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
there that especially feeds into our

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.040 
there that especially feeds into our
long<00:03:51.070> tail<00:03:51.370> but<00:03:52.300> when<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.450> bring<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> higher

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
long tail but when I bring in the higher

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.600 
long tail but when I bring in the higher
octave

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.210 

really<00:03:56.540> gives<00:03:56.720> another<00:03:57.020> layer<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.380> detail<00:03:57.740> and

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
really gives another layer of detail and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.670 
really gives another layer of detail and
if<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.490> can<00:03:58.700> play<00:03:59.150> with<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.420> pitch<00:03:59.630> of<00:04:00.500> your

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
if you can play with the pitch of your

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.850 
if you can play with the pitch of your
drum<00:04:00.890> sound<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.490> can<00:04:01.850> count<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.210> guy

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.480 

and<00:04:06.220> actually<00:04:06.490> create<00:04:06.790> some<00:04:06.940> pretty<00:04:07.360> wild

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.360 

spacey<00:04:12.270> effects<00:04:12.690> on<00:04:12.780> there

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.180 

same<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.609> stairs<00:04:18.739> because<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.889> higher

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
same with the stairs because the higher

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.830 
same with the stairs because the higher
octave<00:04:20.400> kind<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.880> reveals<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.359> little<00:04:21.600> bit<00:04:21.720> of

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
octave kind of reveals a little bit of

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:47.959 
octave kind of reveals a little bit of
the<00:04:22.190> inherent<00:04:23.190> pitch<00:04:23.400> in<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.639> drone<00:04:23.850> itself

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.520 

so<00:04:48.969> sure<00:04:49.389> is<00:04:49.539> pretty<00:04:49.719> fun<00:04:49.930> for<00:04:49.960> those<00:04:50.259> kind<00:04:50.499> of

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
so sure is pretty fun for those kind of

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.980 
so sure is pretty fun for those kind of
things<00:04:50.770> just<00:04:51.159> like<00:04:51.249> that<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:52.449> then<00:04:52.599> obviously

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
things just like that and then obviously

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.779 
things just like that and then obviously
you<00:04:53.199> can<00:04:53.259> feed<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:54.219> you<00:04:54.340> have<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.490> stutter

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
you can feed if you have a stutter

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.219 
you can feed if you have a stutter
effect<00:04:56.069> you<00:04:57.069> can<00:04:57.219> feed<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.490> into<00:04:58.479> your

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
effect you can feed that into your

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.119 
effect you can feed that into your
reverb<00:04:59.529> and<00:04:59.770> get<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.919> bit<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.779> free<00:05:01.779> delay

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
reverb and get a bit of a free delay

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.409 
reverb and get a bit of a free delay
actually<00:05:03.129> coming<00:05:03.550> from<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:03.789> machine<00:05:03.909> itself

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
actually coming from the machine itself

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.290
