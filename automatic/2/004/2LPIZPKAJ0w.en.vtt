any<00:03:02.260> colors<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:06.460> most<00:03:06.640> important<00:03:07.270> thing<00:03:07.510> is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
any colors the most important thing is

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.390 
any colors the most important thing is
learning<00:03:08.470> what<00:03:08.830> colors<00:03:09.280> go<00:03:09.550> together<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:12.220> can

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
learning what colors go together you can

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.970 
learning what colors go together you can
use<00:03:12.430> any<00:03:13.030> colors<00:03:13.570> even<00:03:14.320> if<00:03:14.500> they<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.740> go

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
use any colors even if they don't go

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.640 
use any colors even if they don't go
together<00:03:15.130> they<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:15.940> cannot<00:03:16.360> touch<00:03:16.690> so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
together they just cannot touch so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.360 
together they just cannot touch so
sometimes<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.460> have<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.880> use<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:20.100> medium<00:03:21.100> color

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
sometimes you have to use a medium color

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.420 
sometimes you have to use a medium color
or<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.090> middle<00:03:22.600> color<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.320> blend<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.100> colors

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
or a middle color to blend the colors

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.480 
or a middle color to blend the colors
together<00:03:24.550> if<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:26.710> choose<00:03:27.010> will<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> be

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
together if you so choose will you be

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.210 
together if you so choose will you be
used<00:03:27.730> at<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:30.330> background<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:32.980> want<00:03:33.130> to

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
used at the background so you want to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.820 
used at the background so you want to
separate<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.730> colors<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:35.140> remember<00:03:35.650> keep

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
separate the colors just remember keep

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.660 
separate the colors just remember keep
in<00:03:36.010> mind<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:37.020> overspray<00:03:38.020> what<00:03:38.950> color<00:03:39.250> it's

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
in mind the overspray what color it's

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.650 
in mind the overspray what color it's
going<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.060> cast<00:03:40.330> um<00:03:41.790> that's<00:03:42.790> very<00:03:42.910> important

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
going to cast um that's very important

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.340 
going to cast um that's very important
because<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.830> colors<00:03:45.400> do<00:03:46.180> mix<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.780> they

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
because if the colors do mix and they

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.210 
because if the colors do mix and they
don't<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.740> together

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
don't go together

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.530 
don't go together
you<00:03:48.880> will<00:03:49.120> get<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.740> muddy<00:03:50.740> kind<00:03:51.460> of<00:03:51.670> look<00:03:52.240> to

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
you will get a muddy kind of look to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:11.090 
you will get a muddy kind of look to
your<00:03:53.290> piece

in this particular piece we're going to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.030 
in this particular piece we're going to
go<00:04:13.510> away<00:04:13.570> from<00:04:13.840> simple<00:04:14.200> colors<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.740> little<00:04:14.890> bit

okay<00:04:40.480> now<00:04:40.720> let's<00:04:40.990> just<00:04:41.200> say<00:04:41.380> for<00:04:41.590> instance<00:04:41.740> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
okay now let's just say for instance the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.460 
okay now let's just say for instance the
customer<00:04:42.610> came<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.240> wanted<00:04:43.420> some<00:04:44.080> purple

customer came in and wanted some purple
in<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.620> design<00:04:45.720> instead<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:46.990> using<00:04:47.410> just

in this design instead of you using just

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.880 
in this design instead of you using just
green<00:04:48.310> at<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> bottom<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.210> would<00:04:49.710> shift<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
green at the bottom you would shift the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.530 
green at the bottom you would shift the
purple<00:04:51.280> up<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.690> between<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:54.420> with<00:04:55.420> that

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
purple up and and between it with that

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.010 
purple up and and between it with that
green<00:04:55.900> least<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.620> yellow<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.980> would<00:04:57.250> put<00:04:57.430> blue

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
green least a yellow you would put blue

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.940 
green least a yellow you would put blue
blend<00:04:59.020> blue<00:04:59.320> into<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.740> purple<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.800> way

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
blend blue into that purple and that way

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.650 
blend blue into that purple and that way
when<00:05:03.100> you<00:05:03.190> put<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.430> yellow<00:05:03.610> in<00:05:03.940> you'll<00:05:04.420> get<00:05:04.600> a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
when you put the yellow in you'll get a

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.370 
when you put the yellow in you'll get a
shift<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.170> green<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:07.720> will<00:05:07.900> stand<00:05:08.140> out

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
shift of green and that will stand out

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.870 
shift of green and that will stand out
between<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.520> purple<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:11.110> yellow

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
between the purple and the yellow

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.300 
between the purple and the yellow
because<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:13.240> don't<00:05:13.420> want<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.440> purple<00:05:14.740> and

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
because you don't want the purple and

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.680 
because you don't want the purple and
the<00:05:15.370> yellow<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.730> mix<00:05:15.970> because<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.420> will<00:05:16.540> create

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
the yellow to mix because it will create

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.640 
the yellow to mix because it will create
a<00:05:16.870> brown<00:05:18.000> muddy<00:05:19.000> color<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.440> definitely

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
a brown muddy color and you definitely

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.480 
a brown muddy color and you definitely
don't<00:05:20.890> want<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.280> touch<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.520> orange<00:05:22.090> so

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
don't want it to touch the orange so

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:38.420 
don't want it to touch the orange so
that's<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:24.820> way<00:05:24.970> that<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.780> would<00:05:25.960> do<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.350> anyway

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.220
