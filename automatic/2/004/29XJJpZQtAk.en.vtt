00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.800 
outboard motor and that will fire a sign
of<00:02:08.039> forward<00:02:08.460> just<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> spotlight<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of forward just like the spotlight a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
of forward just like the spotlight a
tool<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.619> will<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> real<00:02:11.220> weapon<00:02:11.400> for

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
tool like that will be a real weapon for

us<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.910> looking<00:02:12.090> forward<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.390> using<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.720> of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
us and looking forward to using one of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.350 
us and looking forward to using one of
those

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
those

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
those
I<00:02:13.420> think<00:02:13.690> what<00:02:13.810> will<00:02:13.900> take<00:02:14.080> away<00:02:14.320> from<00:02:14.620> seeing

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
