 I bring 1 undoing the supplies and 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.799
 Well, this time I'm going to do it in PC 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.030
 4 although the weapon that touches me depends 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.469
 ok I have three supplies depends on 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.790
 weapon that touches me if it is a weapon that does not 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.990
 I have accessories and it's too bad 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 then I'll go play with him arm themselves 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
 equipment since in teams practically 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 I have all of them, not so , I get a 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 weapon in decent quotes or do I have 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 accesses with it so I'll play here if 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 do not catch that gun and play in xbox like that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.609
 let's see what we kids have to do 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.869
 we go there as I always have and four 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 so let's see what we have is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 minister lists like nigeria's bill and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 the elite eclipse merchant that is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.669
 a bit honestly shit another me 14 l 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.719
 previous vision and match the goal of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.930
 if I touch another little thing over here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.280
 different that I do not get eclipse 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.750
 running mask that this is the one 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.219
 had to touch through noses so 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.820
 let's wait neighbor this with weapons if not 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.829

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.289
 elite elite but we will play 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.149
 kids again with the m-14 in this 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.850
 occasion with the eclipse that is much worse 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.760
 than the one I played in the previous episode 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.559
 so if you look like I'm going for the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 xbox and let's play with the m-14 eclipse 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.840
 in the xbox 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.910
 Well, we are very far back and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 we are with the eclipse and good 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.200
 just like that I agree here because 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.030
 I have more seen of that 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.619
 and certainly the eclipse and I tell you it is 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.549
 even worse that I think I have 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.409
 a right 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.409
 so it's worth it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.690
 here the equals 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.570
 please leave me in peace strong fuck to 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.340
 see wait moment please the cream 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.110
 also problem takes fear to see 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.520
 see a little bit of tranquility leave me 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.010
 a little peace and quiet please 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.470
 I have been around that corner and it has been 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.770
 a plan to by that you know all to me 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.300
 come and that if he had already left 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.500
 very justito good for you to know it at 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.400
 just do not explain it in the other 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.320
 episode but like 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.970
 do you call the other M14 which will 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.950
 they go up damage it really does not go up 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.180
 much that you put then you have less 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.040
 cadence than the original in exchange for 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.780
 nothing to lose everything more precision does not 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 you can put because the pressure that you have 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.590
 this weapon is perfect let's say the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.150
 fucking shotgun the pressure that is 14 is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.620
 perfect does not move absolutely nothing 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.369
 then as much as the best 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.160
 precision then it's worth it then you stay in 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.270
 plan as it is worth I have behind it can be no 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880
 I know but I 'm going for one that is 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.940
 here 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.260
 this was not this question and it gives you in the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.260
 head just when it fell perfect 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.599
 very important to jump with the meca data 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.939
 I also have an unlocked cylinder head 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.129
 episode with which he hears so much 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.060
 better when trying to kill people 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.060
 close up 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.069
 you were leaving me 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.810
 from hips very bad to hip wales 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.080
 it also drops two points that came from 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.980
 hip is pretty bad hip 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.769
 then trust this hip weapon 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 never in a no from behind can this be 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.819
 we pay them is already like very frantic already 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.080
 that in this beginning of the game if 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.849
 you stay here as the most normal thing is 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.560
 that you catch is basically you kill a lot 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.040
 but villas because in they do all the time 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.420
 side of you 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.420
 really what fun does not 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.470
 in the head it bust him 98 or 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.870
 whether it is minimally touched by 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.910
 anything can be dismissed suÃ¡rez 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.140
 my uncle caught me in the back and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.760
 You see I'm playing in that area that 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.380
 Where else is the sun always against 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.060
 to all to win games beyond 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.800
 make a good game to win 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.180
 games you have to go where is the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.709
 people and where are the people is where 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.660
 maybe more die but also where 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.959
 let's kill and faster you will advance 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.079
 do not 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.999
 and make good use of and take advantage of 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.159
 low that you have that you have between 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.180
 quotes so much the time you earn salt 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.629
 it is called so much the time by novas 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.629
 take advantage of anything 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.390
 I had no absolute thought here 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.130
 s manauel the bitch is that which is a 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.520
 little slow decay the best model 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.510
 I have already said many times to me 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.790
 use it of it stays all that crater 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.830
 It has a lot of cadence and in Caracas 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.240
 even fuck how hard it is to kill a 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.920
 uncle with no cadence is that also 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.990
 all the time and the finger I can not 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.580
 demonstrate here the pajero said no 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.620
 took cadence you have greater today a 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.000
 I can not show the cadence 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.069
 from my finger pajero how to say fear 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.689
 turbus 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.140
 you call me and me being a pajero 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.330
 I do not 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.740
 that are called stealing can not be that I 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.450
 have stealing the two guys is the worst thing 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.120
 it can happen to you the worst uncle that is 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.890
 shooting one is stolen and you go 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.570
 to kill the other and they also rob you 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.430
 it takes until that you rob me low 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.720
 and kill me all the time that yes 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.710
 we have started my mother I start 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.340
 do not 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.780
 while there is one against one, it can be 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.990
 I think they entered the game with a 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.990
 Big group 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.119
 while we create 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.379
 while the fan is not 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.379
 he wants to die mate 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.620
 I'm going to trust that some chain 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.770
 but I 'm not going to point because 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.340
 forget about hip killing with this 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.340
 here 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.180
 let's go down here I have behind can 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.440
 be 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.270
 show a reflex act would face by 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.510
 reflex act shot and they give the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.170
 head 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.170
 one more 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.110
 and mba looks at the part that before in the 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.219
 previous episode was carrying a charger 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.999
 expanded and it is from time to time 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.999
 explaining without bullets 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.070
 and heavy and death I thought I thought 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.160
 that came for me to russia to the roof but 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.160
 do not 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.320
 When you see my mother's hip, do not tell me 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.090
 I think and the kind of good floor has 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.740
 dead stomping because I'm afraid that I 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.930
 like the last one always try to do 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.370
 a cool guy stepped on him but he has not 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.140
 dead by the height today on the skin 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.820
 you do not see the son of a bitch cable 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.350
 so today save them but they like this 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.450
 episode my mother nor often beginnings 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.980
 and so spectacular and see continues to 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.300
 another episode touched me thermal 14 because 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.070
 go male fabric that the mega twist a 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.180
 weapon that I hate in this game that I do not use 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.990
 never because I do not like absolutely 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.730
 nothing 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.170
 I find it very bad and he keeps giving it to me 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.910
 so the fact has liked episode 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.330
 leave your favorite likes and if you 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.050
 for more 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.050
 goodbye
