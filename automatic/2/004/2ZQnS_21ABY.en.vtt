rack<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:21.049> actually<00:02:22.049> was<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> fairly<00:02:22.560> easy

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
rack in actually was a fairly easy

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.800 
rack in actually was a fairly easy
process<00:02:24.380> you'll<00:02:25.380> notice<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.810> sort

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
process you'll notice that I have sort

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.729 
process you'll notice that I have sort
of<00:02:27.870> space<00:02:28.640> underneath<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.820> rack<00:02:30.209> itself

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
of space underneath the rack itself

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.789 
of space underneath the rack itself
which<00:02:31.739> should<00:02:32.010> actually<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.760> able<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.120> fit<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
which should actually be able to fit a

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.920 
which should actually be able to fit a
four-by-eight<00:02:35.690> plywood<00:02:36.950> board<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.160> required

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
four-by-eight plywood board if required

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
four-by-eight plywood board if required
the<00:02:39.930> containers<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.459> will

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the containers that you see there will

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.060 
the containers that you see there will
actually<00:02:42.540> get<00:02:42.720> moved<00:02:43.019> outside<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:43.830> I'm

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
actually get moved outside because I'm

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.350 
actually get moved outside because I'm
actually<00:02:44.220> building<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:45.530> woodshed<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.360> then

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
actually building a woodshed and then

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.780 
actually building a woodshed and then
ultimately<00:02:48.750> what'll<00:02:49.530> end<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.830> happening<00:02:49.890> is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
ultimately what'll end up happening is

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.120 
ultimately what'll end up happening is
the<00:02:51.750> drum<00:02:52.050> sander<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
the drum sander and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.270 
the drum sander and
router<00:02:53.400> table<00:02:54.020> will<00:02:55.020> fit<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:56.700> hope<00:02:58.280> underneath

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
router table will fit I hope underneath

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.840 
router table will fit I hope underneath
the<00:02:59.640> rack<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.450> actually<00:03:04.520> even<00:03:05.520> with<00:03:05.670> all

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850
