00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.010 
collection so basically anything I've
picked<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.639> over<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> past<00:00:15.150> couple<00:00:15.450> years<00:00:15.630> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
picked up over the past couple years so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.500 
picked up over the past couple years so
the<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.350> item<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:18.090> lace

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the first item I have is this lace

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.010 
the first item I have is this lace
button-down<00:00:19.439> shirt<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.570> originally

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
button-down shirt and it was originally

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.380 
button-down shirt and it was originally
an<00:00:22.230> awkward<00:00:22.830> length<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> chopped<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
an awkward length so I chopped off the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.300 
an awkward length so I chopped off the
bottom<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.810> make<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> into<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> crop<00:00:25.560> top<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
bottom to make it into a crop top and I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.560 
bottom to make it into a crop top and I
thought<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> would<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.180> cute<00:00:27.390> for

sweater since it's a cream color I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.020 
sweater since it's a cream color I
believe<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.239> was<00:00:51.449> $7<00:00:52.230> again<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.850> great

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
believe this was $7 again not that great

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
believe this was $7 again not that great
of<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> deal<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.160> thought<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.399> could<00:00:56.550> be

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
of a deal but I thought it could be

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.979 
of a deal but I thought it could be
really<00:00:57.270> versatile<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.949> bought<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.989> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
really versatile so I bought it and the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
really versatile so I bought it and the
next<00:01:01.230> item<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.039> probably<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> my

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
next item I have is probably one of my

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.990 
next item I have is probably one of my
favorite<00:01:03.510> finds<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.979> light<00:01:05.700> wash

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
favorite finds and it's this light wash

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.149 
favorite finds and it's this light wash
denim<00:01:06.450> jacket<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.619> supposed<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> be

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
denim jacket and it's supposed to be

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
denim jacket and it's supposed to be
like<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.610> structured<00:01:09.030> jacket<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.510> fairly

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like a structured jacket this is fairly

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
like a structured jacket this is fairly
thin<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.280> layer<00:01:11.909> pieces

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
thin so you can really layer pieces

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.609 
thin so you can really layer pieces
underneath<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.670> around<00:01:15.090> 10<00:01:15.420> dollars

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
underneath it this was around 10 dollars

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.170 
underneath it this was around 10 dollars
okay<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.250> summer<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.909> not

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
okay so I know it's summer and it's not

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.109
