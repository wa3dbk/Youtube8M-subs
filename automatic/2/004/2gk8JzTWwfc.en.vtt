00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.359
 Good night, everybody, alvinegra nation. 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.349
 I'm making this video for you here. 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.509
 to teach you how to take the name of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059
 Dutch ronald does not even play 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.880
 is only a simulation that has already 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 I took the name it worked, but we'll do it. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.480
 a simulation you will understand 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 I'm sure I'll take it off because 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 He does not deserve to leave it to our 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.730
 holy mantle that is the Flemish shirt 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.529
 already being a name I already took number 10 and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 Lets favor that number is very 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.110
 important for a tire that is 11 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.250
 represents the zico our greatest idol 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 downstairs has a mulambo name 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.160
 Ronaldinho 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.559
 You're going to need something to be. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.559
 region but not gel is common in the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 In the case of Miguel, who ended up today 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:01:04.129
 Towel protecting paper in the unit is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.129
 very important to be here stamped 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 garbage trash will turn just like 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.630
 I'm doing here you'll see that it's not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.600
 is in the attack are duck ronaldinho 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.080
 You 'll get the album with something common is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.110
 for you is not something uncommon generates 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.450
 took the role of the duck will wet the album 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.990
 and will start to go wrong. 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 above the name of the next averse to it 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.119
 several times let cardinal remember 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.509
 you take great care of the humidity 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.030
 It's very important for us in the first 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.850
 last year high doing it looking 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.580
 everything looking all right leaving 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.010
 leave the rear window 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.570
 had six come back here the situation 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.990
 putting here live and even the world 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.470
 Mulambo sure I'll do it here I go 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.470
 get up with the paper you pick up 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.230
 Something again the top on top of each 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.860
 letter I starting with pr 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.800
 to soak up the classroom they start to 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.430
 take the process of taking the name of the 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.840
 ronaldinho can make himself potatoes will give 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.450
 Right. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.560
 and so goes successively each letter 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.310
 each letter you go in a ringo 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.820
 alcohol and plate that begins to 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.740
 pluck the resin goes out it goes 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.720
 keep the stain on mine you can 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.209
 to notice there will not be a glue stain 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.130
 but over time the washing is Flemish 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.040
 at first she will record nothing came out 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.040
 You pick alcohol from varzim. 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.410
 until she knows who she's going to get out of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150
 the name of the steering wheel of an audi will leave 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.760
 head up and the hand of an option to 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.630
 normal people from our shirt 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.880
 For me it's an option. I'm a flamenguista. 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.370
 I'm very dangerous if it's the first name if 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.940
 became a reason need people who 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.940
 Do you like flamenco?
