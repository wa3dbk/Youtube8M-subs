00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099 

I<00:00:04.759> don't<00:00:05.759> think<00:00:06.089> it's<00:00:06.299> important<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.899> all<00:00:07.080> I

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
I don't think it's important at all I

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.100 
I don't think it's important at all I
had<00:00:07.529> absolutely<00:00:08.220> no<00:00:08.490> idea<00:00:08.519> even<00:00:09.510> up<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
had absolutely no idea even up to the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.450 
had absolutely no idea even up to the
point<00:00:10.349> where<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> had<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.769> finally<00:00:11.250> make<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
point where I had to finally make a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.390 
point where I had to finally make a
decision<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.500> where<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> wanted<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.160> so

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
decision as to where I wanted to do so

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.480 
decision as to where I wanted to do so
initially<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.389> osteopathic<00:00:16.139> medicine

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
initially so with osteopathic medicine

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.800 
initially so with osteopathic medicine
and<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.550> think<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.880> changed<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:18.539> bit

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and I think it's changed a little bit

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.830 
and I think it's changed a little bit
but<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.260> certain<00:00:19.890> states<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:21.720> know

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
but in certain states and I don't know

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290 
but in certain states and I don't know
for<00:00:22.050> sure<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:23.070> still<00:00:23.369> an<00:00:23.490> issue<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
for sure if that's still an issue you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
for sure if that's still an issue you
had<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> rotating<00:00:25.529> osteopathic<00:00:26.340> year

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
had to have a rotating osteopathic year

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
had to have a rotating osteopathic year
if<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> wanted<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.449> certain<00:00:27.720> specialties

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
if you wanted to do certain specialties

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.609 
if you wanted to do certain specialties
and<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> figured<00:00:30.480> well<00:00:30.660> what's<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> harm<00:00:31.439> in

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and so I figured well what's the harm in

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319 
and so I figured well what's the harm in
doing<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.009> extra<00:00:32.279> year<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.579> training<00:00:32.820> anyways

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
doing an extra year of training anyways

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.180 
doing an extra year of training anyways
so<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.630> opted<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> osteopathic

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
so I opted to do the osteopathic

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
so I opted to do the osteopathic
rotating<00:00:35.640> year<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> gave<00:00:36.690> me

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
rotating year like that way it gave me

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.560 
rotating year like that way it gave me
more<00:00:37.430> options<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.090> when<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> finally

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
more options you know when I finally

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.740 
more options you know when I finally
knew<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.200> even<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.940> problem<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
knew and even so the problem is with the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
knew and even so the problem is with the
timing<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.860> apply<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:44.879> these

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
timing that you have to apply for these

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.170 
timing that you have to apply for these
positions<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.890> only<00:00:47.280> gave<00:00:47.489> me<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:48.030> or

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
positions it only gave me about one or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
positions it only gave me about one or
two<00:00:48.210> months<00:00:48.660> into<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> osteopathic<00:00:50.129> rotating

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
two months into the osteopathic rotating

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.450 
two months into the osteopathic rotating
year<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.300> didn't<00:00:51.600> help<00:00:51.750> me<00:00:51.989> much

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
year so that really didn't help me much

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
year so that really didn't help me much
and<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:54.090> still<00:00:54.329> left<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> end<00:00:55.020> being

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and so I was still left at the end being

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
and so I was still left at the end being
like<00:00:55.559> well<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
like well what do I want to do and and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
like well what do I want to do and and
then<00:00:57.719> ultimately<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.649> realized<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
then ultimately I just realized that I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.599 
then ultimately I just realized that I
liked<00:00:59.960> being<00:01:00.960> able<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.920> about

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
liked being able to know about

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
liked being able to know about
everything<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:03.960> even<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:04.530> not

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
everything and you know even if I'm not

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.770 
everything and you know even if I'm not
gonna<00:01:04.949> specialize<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.240> at

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
gonna specialize in that I would at

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.030 
gonna specialize in that I would at
least<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.560> bit<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.920> an

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
least know a little bit have an

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
least know a little bit have an
understanding<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.820> able<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> send<00:01:09.330> them

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
understanding and be able to send them

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.490 
understanding and be able to send them
to<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:09.810> person

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to the right person

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
to the right person
so<00:01:11.070> that's<00:01:11.670> finally<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> made<00:01:12.420> my

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so that's finally when I made my

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
so that's finally when I made my
decision<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.770> well<00:01:13.950> family

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
decision that I was like well family

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
decision that I was like well family
medicine<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.850> makes<00:01:15.000> sense<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
medicine it makes sense you get to do a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140 
medicine it makes sense you get to do a
little<00:01:16.320> bit<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.619> everything<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.430> treat<00:01:17.790> every

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
little bit of everything and treat every

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.530 
little bit of everything and treat every
age<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.780> yeah<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> had<00:01:20.369> absolutely<00:01:20.909> no<00:01:21.030> idea

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
age so yeah so I had absolutely no idea

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.710 
age so yeah so I had absolutely no idea
before<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.470> mm-hm

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
before going in mm-hm

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.760 
before going in mm-hm
dr.<00:01:24.720> Simmons<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.049> mentioned<00:01:25.290> before<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
dr. Simmons you mentioned before the you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
dr. Simmons you mentioned before the you
you<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> do

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you right I think that you know you do

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
you right I think that you know you do
12<00:01:28.290> weeks<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> surgery<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.400> 12<00:01:29.729> weeks<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
12 weeks of surgery you do 12 weeks of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
12 weeks of surgery you do 12 weeks of
medicine<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.900> 12<00:01:31.170> weeks<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.619> OB<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
medicine you do 12 weeks of OB and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.819 
medicine you do 12 weeks of OB and
during<00:01:32.430> each<00:01:32.670> rotation<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.229> case<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
during each rotation in my case with the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190 
during each rotation in my case with the
exception<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> surgery<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.270> say<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.840> going

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
exception of surgery you say I'm going

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
exception of surgery you say I'm going
to<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.070> thought<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.520> sure<00:01:38.790> when

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to do this like I thought for sure when

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.399 
to do this like I thought for sure when
I<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.450> Cook<00:01:39.600> County<00:01:39.630> Hospital<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.380> Chicago

and I thought oh this will be fun and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
and I thought oh this will be fun and
then<00:01:54.509> until<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:55.200> poor<00:01:55.740> child<00:01:55.979> came<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> you

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.170 
do this so I think you need to go into
each<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:02.159> rotations<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.969> eyes

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
each one of your rotations with eyes

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.660 
each one of your rotations with eyes
wide<00:02:03.210> open<00:02:03.869> saying<00:02:04.439> hey<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> fit<00:02:05.490> for

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
wide open saying hey is this a fit for

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
wide open saying hey is this a fit for
me<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:06.960> feel<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
me and you really will feel it so I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.390 
me and you really will feel it so I
think<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:09.500> traditional<00:02:10.500> Western<00:02:11.099> medical

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
think for traditional Western medical

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.140 
think for traditional Western medical
schools<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.879> third-year<00:02:12.360> resident

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
schools the third-year resident

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.080 
schools the third-year resident
year/year<00:02:13.959> allows<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.459> opportunity

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
year/year allows you that opportunity

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
year/year allows you that opportunity
and<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:16.269> forth<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.989> electives<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and then forth you you to electives and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.649 
and then forth you you to electives and
so<00:02:18.280> during<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.700> period<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.180> time<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.540> can

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
so during that period of time you can

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.059 
so during that period of time you can
really<00:02:19.870> kind<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.200> formulate<00:02:20.650> before<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.950> have

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
really kind of formulate before you have

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.380 
really kind of formulate before you have
to<00:02:21.189> do<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.430> match<00:02:21.610> yeah

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
to do the match yeah

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
to do the match yeah
and<00:02:22.810> I've<00:02:23.049> heard<00:02:23.409> that<00:02:23.500> echoed<00:02:23.739> by<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> lot<00:02:24.189> of

and I've heard that echoed by a lot of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.770 
and I've heard that echoed by a lot of
recent<00:02:24.849> medical<00:02:25.090> graduates<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.689> I've
