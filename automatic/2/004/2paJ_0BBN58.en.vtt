00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.320
 well we keep practicing with javier ha 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.510
 the products have been important 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.430
 like the avocado but the benefits that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
 are achieved today there is a product that are 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.000
 bringing to market without a doubt 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 will innovate and will also change the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 way to see this food this fruit 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.690
 that has become a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
 watershed in the food in the 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.920
 Mexican nutrition there is an oil that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.449
 The company that you represent is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.820
 launching to the market that is very 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.730
 important as they have called it and what 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 benefits has javier to this this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 oil that we are extracting seems 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.920
 like it's one more avocado oil in 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.219
 the market 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.950
 and the truth is that this oil is a 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.290
 has an extra virgin quality 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.320
 the process that is followed in this type of 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.740
 oil and that is a process less 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.500
 oxidative normally to extract 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.960
 avocado oil in plants that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.400
 exist in the region is drawn from everything 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.970
 the fruit is cut into flakes 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.960
 avocado with whole and bone peel and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.990
 and pulp 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.119
 It goes into a drying process to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 remove all the moisture and then 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.280
 grinds the day the already dry dry grandmother 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.860
 until black from dehydration and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 then it is already milled what after the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.310
 Grinding is pressed and the oil is extracted 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.380
 in this process that we do is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.960
 totally different that process is very 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.720
 very oxidative then quickly to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.759
 rancid the product has to have a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.619
 refinement process 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 we are extracting in this 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.229
 oil or avocado pulp is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 without bone or shell which is what 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.970
 we are achieving with this that the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 avocado leaves exactly with all the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.039
 quantity the largest amount of chlorophyll 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.790
 the greatest amount of nutrients is a 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.980
 is one if I had is the color of the oil 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.759
 I think it's interesting what you've 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.680
 commented javier that we can say to the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.110
