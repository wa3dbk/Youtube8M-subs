 hello everyone guys this will be a really but really good tutorial 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.600
 this time it will be serious 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.789
 who owns windows or especially windows 7 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.099
 I realized that going into the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.220
 system settings mainly search 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.880
 go under the dwarves 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.270
 to change the system settings it is not easy on windows 7 years 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.159
 for you 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.069
 a bit complicated is not intuitive enough 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.990
 but we cannot make up for this lack with a trick 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.690
 we have a tool hidden on the wall on windos 7 May 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.260
 it should also work on sight but honestly I am sincere I never have 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.180
 tried 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.810
 I do not know 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.740
 andrea that allows us to access 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.050
 up now all the functions of the system tell me if you are also modified 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.100
 a functions that will have to pur 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.700
 sorry I went cup 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.610
 how to do 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.790
 let's create a very simple folder on the desktop 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
 new 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.390
 we remain the folder 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.410
 in this way 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.490
 you can find exactly the name in the description 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.890
 save the folder 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.200
 she had to enter desktop on these conan golden fashions 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.920
 we open last 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 and here we are 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.320
 as you can see 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 we all have 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 windows functions 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 kyoto play backup administrative tools 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.870
 date clock 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.510
 color manager 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 desktop gadget programs 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.690
 in short, we can go and find everything we need 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.159
 keyboard settings keys 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.659
 network control panel all here 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.099
 all adopted 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.319
 create a 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.619
 h1 in short, the word file 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:20.479
 this driver accesses all system settings quickly without having to 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:24.419
 worrying about that complicated menu itself is not easy 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.659
 just intuitive 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.659
