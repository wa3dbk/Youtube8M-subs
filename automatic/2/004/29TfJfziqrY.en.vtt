00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.290
 medulla 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.329
 if we look at its external structure 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 contains a central surface as a gift 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.910
 greasy surface and lateral 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910
 surface 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.160
 on the front surface 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.289
 medulla is anterior 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.239
 median fissure which is 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.570
 a continuation 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.789
 the same gap in the spinal cord on the sides 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.710
 from the front middle of the gap is 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.909
 medulla pyramid 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.750
 pyramid medulla tax these in these 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.299
 the pyramids pass the downward cortical 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.159
 spinal cortical spinal cord 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.689
 ways 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.720
 on the side of the medulla pyramids 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.869
 there is anterior lateral groove 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.840
 sulcus 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.020
 antara lateralis treasure earlier 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.650
 is olive 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.780
 Ali also about Latin olive and 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.409
 Lateral arif is sulcus poster

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.430
 at the bottom of the pyramids on the border with the spinal 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 the brain is the intersection of ramis you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.409
 eat the whole pyramid this particular 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.079
 cross leg serves as an identification 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.409
 sign of the border between the elongated 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.259
 brain and spinal cord on the back 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.570
 medulla surface 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:02.000
 is from 2 elevations which 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.990
 pass two beams that thin beam path 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.300
 bundle will or wedge-shaped bundle 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.640
 Burda x and that thin beam 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.530
 is medial than wedge 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.459
 bunch of 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.060
 we will look at the internal structure 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.319
 medulla we can see 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.490
 that it consists of gray matter and 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.890
 white matter unlike spinal 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.590
 there is no clear division of the brain 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.700
 gray matter and white matter gray 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.340
 substance here are presented and I am a drama 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.019
 identifies four groups yager 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.910
 medulla firstly it 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.180
 thin and wedge-shaped poison which 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.209
 located on the dorsal surface or 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 on the back surface is different 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.200
 medulla here you can 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.620
 see here it is thin and drop 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.620
 Latin love happy and this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.470
 wedge-shaped core well plus kunio ace 2 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.350
 groups i der medulla this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.680
 olive kernels by the way thin and wedge-shaped 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.180
 the kernels are the ultimate I drama 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.190
 a little sensitivity from deep body 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.940
 sensitivity from muscles and tendons 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.340
 body further the second group is yaga olive 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.959
 nucleo whether warez that come 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.920
 I will feed 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.870
 and the red jager midbrain farther from 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.549
 there are ways in the cerebellum 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.250
 3 groups is eggs give birth to the ocular 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.350
 formations that make up the respiratory 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.900
 center vascular motor center and 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.540
 other various centers oblong 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.340
 brain which plays a very important role in 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.970
 human life 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:01.079
 and also I am 9- klyarnn information they here 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:05.489
 about here is perform the role 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:10.380
 intermediate or connecting neurons in 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.160
 various connections seamlessly smile and 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.340
 Group 4 attire of this bed ninth 12 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.650
 cranial nerve pairs 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.690
 I repeat how these poisons are called 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.930
 12 core sublingual 11 additional 10 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.340
 wandering 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.100
 and 9 languages ​​a year 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.570
 what contains 1 motor core but in 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.360
 need the hands closer 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:41.990
 hydra habitual nerve she is 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.210
 about here further 1 core also 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.000
 contains only one motor core 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.120
 nucleus motors no and nerves accessories 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.750
 translates as motor bucket 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.650
 accessory nerve 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:59.420
 she is a little closer to the front 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.480
 surfaces of the medulla oblongata 10 and 9 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.030
 they contain at bedside 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.560
 three buckets each motor sensitive 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.660
 and parasympathetic with 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.860
 sensitive parasympathetic tape 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.520
 they are common 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.150
 sensitive nucleus is nuclei loss 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.690
 solitary and core 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:23.240
 solitary path here it is about here and 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.100
 man and motor nucleus nucleus on 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.310
 baby you're double playing with them too 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.520
 total r is about here a 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.380
 parasympathetic brawl 10 and 11 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.440
 cranial nerves different in 10 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.419
 this is the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.500
 nucleus dorsalis narve vogue 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:50.000
 and 9 is an external saliva divider by core 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:55.100
 nucleus or thorium inferior is it in 9 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.479
 and that in 10 of the nerve fibers of the white white 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.910
 who carry which is 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.900
 paths that go upper 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.300
 divisions of the brain and spinal cord 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.479
 also represented in the medulla oblongata 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.800
 one of them is the most important 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:18.410
 pyramids which are crust you back 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.140
 the brain path descending and bear 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.669
 motive information 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.130
 humans medial loop 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.169
 can talk to you about these games 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.840
 medulla as the nucleus only 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.530
 nucleus graces and wedge-shaped don + 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.500
 kitchen ace 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.289
 this bed get information about deep 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.760
 sensitivity from the whole body deep 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.520
 sensitivity refers 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.919
 muscle and joint 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.349
 feel that is the orientation about 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:50.919
 body position in space further from 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:53.620
 these yager go axon ii or fibers 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:57.699
 that go centrally and here they are 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.849
 make a crossroads and move on to another 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:03.550
 side and this intersection forms 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:07.210
 I laughed at the medial loop 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.539
 Further type of fiber go to the thalamus so we 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.880
 You have dealt with the next topic 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.270
 rhomboid brain its medulla oblongata 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.270
 brain 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.360
 external and internal medial structure 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.360
 a loop
