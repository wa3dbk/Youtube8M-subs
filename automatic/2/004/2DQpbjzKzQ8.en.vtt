00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 welcome to tripolis tv 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.549
 Today I will show how to make the glass 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.440
 or the display in a Sony xperia z 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.639
 By the way, tablet changes my video 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.080
 description you will find spare parts and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.370
 tools are also used 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 just read through so take your 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.119
 tools yes and let's get started that way 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 Let's start first 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 we will do the tablet if that is possible 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189
 as broken as the thing is here was that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.990
 not possible here so we have to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.279
 disconnect the battery later with the now 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.630
 an ordinary fill and heat that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.510
 backcover to make it easy 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.649
 can be removed 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 next we take a flat 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.590
 plastic chair and go to the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 along the edge and loosen the backcover 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.610
 Please do not hesitate to leave a small note 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.239
 penetrate so deeply with the tool 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.239
 not to damage 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.190
 now remove the backcover and on the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.190
 lay side 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.300
 then we meet the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.710
 Connection of the battery and two more 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.710
 flex cable of the display 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.280
 Next we heat up the glass 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.430
 the hair dryer for a minute on the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
 highest level 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.950
 Now we take simple tool and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.310
 try the display from the glue too 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310
 to solve 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.820
 after that we have to do the rest 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.270
 glass chips and glue residues thoroughly 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 remove 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.230
 then take with you thin 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.450
 glue double sided tape under 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.100
 please pay attention to the entire medium frame 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.700
 on it the cameras and the sensors 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.700
 not to stick 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.099
 now remove all protective films 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.440
 so now we take the new display and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.940
 Carefully push the flex cable through 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.110
 the slot and press the display 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.640
 down with it a good connection 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.640
 between glass and glue arises 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.860
 then we connect both display 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:08.230
 flex cable then the battery 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.580

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.750

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.120
