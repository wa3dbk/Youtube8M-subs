00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
course was always my favorite don't

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.860 
course was always my favorite don't
worry<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:55.729> have<00:04:55.759> to<00:04:55.969> use<00:04:56.150> your<00:04:56.300> watch<00:04:56.539> laser

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
worry you have to use your watch laser

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:09.110 
worry you have to use your watch laser
to<00:04:57.169> escape<00:04:57.530> at<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.830> end

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.930 

and<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:10.500> final<00:05:10.620> battle<00:05:10.919> with<00:05:11.220> wo<00:05:11.520> six<00:05:11.820> is

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
and the final battle with wo six is

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.939 
and the final battle with wo six is
pretty<00:05:12.150> cool<00:05:12.330> also<00:05:12.540> even<00:05:13.410> though<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:13.590> end<00:05:13.800> up

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
pretty cool also even though you end up

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.320 
pretty cool also even though you end up
having<00:05:14.070> to<00:05:14.250> shoot<00:05:14.430> him<00:05:14.580> like<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.729> hundred<00:05:15.150> times

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
having to shoot him like a hundred times

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.730 
having to shoot him like a hundred times
so<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.780> certainly<00:05:15.930> loses<00:05:16.410> some<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.590> its

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
so it certainly loses some of its

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.090 
so it certainly loses some of its
realism<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:17.820> really<00:05:18.120> who<00:05:18.240> cares<00:05:19.100> eventually

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
realism but really who cares eventually

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.500 
realism but really who cares eventually
