you<00:00:52.010> unwell<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.970> text<00:00:53.449> layer<00:00:53.659> you'll<00:00:54.440> see

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
you unwell the text layer you'll see

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.740 
you unwell the text layer you'll see
that<00:00:54.830> you've<00:00:55.010> got<00:00:55.040> text<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:55.909> can<00:00:56.030> untie<00:00:56.540> where

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
that you've got text you can untie where

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.110 
that you've got text you can untie where
it<00:00:56.809> says<00:00:56.989> text<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:57.680> you've<00:00:58.129> got<00:00:58.280> path<00:00:58.550> options

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
it says text and you've got path options

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.110 
it says text and you've got path options
it<00:00:59.330> says<00:00:59.510> path<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:00.739> can<00:01:00.920> select<00:01:01.400> any<00:01:01.699> path

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
it says path and you can select any path

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.119 
it says path and you can select any path
or<00:01:02.449> any<00:01:02.659> mask<00:01:02.960> that's<00:01:03.379> actually<00:01:03.710> already<00:01:03.979> on

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
or any mask that's actually already on

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.000 
or any mask that's actually already on
your<00:01:04.339> layer<00:01:04.550> so<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.570> can<00:01:05.630> go<00:01:05.960> down<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.229> mask<00:01:06.620> 1

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
your layer so I can go down to mask 1

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.580 
your layer so I can go down to mask 1
and<00:01:07.280> immediately<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.390> text<00:01:08.720> goes<00:01:08.960> on<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.470> the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
and immediately the text goes on to the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.530 
and immediately the text goes on to the
path<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.100> I've<00:01:10.790> got<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> whole<00:01:11.180> bunch<00:01:11.420> of

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
path and I've got a whole bunch of

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.539 
path and I've got a whole bunch of
options<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.080> have<00:01:12.200> opened<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:12.680> those

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
options that have opened up those

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.789 
options that have opened up those
options<00:01:14.060> include<00:01:14.510> reverse<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.409> path<00:01:15.590> in

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
options include reverse the path in

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.170 
options include reverse the path in
other<00:01:15.920> words<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.250> text<00:01:16.460> will<00:01:16.640> go<00:01:16.760> underneath

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
other words the text will go underneath

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.779 
other words the text will go underneath
the<00:01:17.450> line<00:01:17.630> in<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:17.960> case<00:01:18.430> we<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.579> look<00:01:19.700> at

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
the line in this case we can look at

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.459 
the line in this case we can look at
perpendicular<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:20.780> other<00:01:20.930> words<00:01:21.140> make<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
perpendicular in other words make the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.410 
perpendicular in other words make the
text<00:01:21.770> stand<00:01:21.950> straight<00:01:22.399> on<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.759> path<00:01:22.789> and<00:01:23.299> not

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
text stand straight on the path and not

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.819 
text stand straight on the path and not
follow<00:01:23.719> it<00:01:23.869> along<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.200> line<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.530> quite<00:01:24.710> the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
follow it along the line in quite the

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.080 
follow it along the line in quite the
same<00:01:25.039> way<00:01:25.189> if<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.369> click<00:01:25.579> on<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.729> you'll<00:01:25.969> see

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
same way if I click on that you'll see

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.179 
same way if I click on that you'll see
the<00:01:26.210> difference<00:01:26.590> looks<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.649> little<00:01:27.710> odd<00:01:28.009> but

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
the difference looks a little odd but

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:28.990 
the difference looks a little odd but
might<00:01:28.340> work<00:01:28.520> for<00:01:28.549> you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
might work for you

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.149 
might work for you
we<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:29.780> force<00:01:30.079> alignment<00:01:30.680> which<00:01:30.770> will<00:01:30.920> force

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
we can force alignment which will force

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.529 
we can force alignment which will force
the<00:01:31.310> text<00:01:31.609> from<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.850> beginning<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.509> end

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
the text from the beginning to the end

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.899 
the text from the beginning to the end
of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.869> path<00:01:33.109> to<00:01:33.380> fit<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:34.219> won't<00:01:34.490> work<00:01:34.640> for

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
of the path to fit that won't work for

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.130 
of the path to fit that won't work for
us<00:01:34.939> because<00:01:35.180> obviously<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.689> path<00:01:35.869> goes

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
us because obviously the path goes

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.020 
us because obviously the path goes
beyond<00:01:36.829> our<00:01:37.039> screen<00:01:37.399> but<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.670> can<00:01:37.759> demonstrate

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
beyond our screen but I can demonstrate

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.529 
beyond our screen but I can demonstrate
that<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.729> then<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.850> first<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.390> last

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
that and then the first and the last

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.060 
that and then the first and the last
margin<00:01:42.079> which<00:01:42.229> are<00:01:42.380> often<00:01:42.530> used<00:01:42.740> in

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
margin which are often used in

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.099 
margin which are often used in
conjunction<00:01:43.189> with<00:01:43.609> other<00:01:43.850> animators<00:01:44.420> but

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
conjunction with other animators but

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.569 
conjunction with other animators but
these<00:01:45.259> are<00:01:45.439> great<00:01:45.649> for<00:01:45.679> pulling<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.219> text

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
these are great for pulling the text

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.760 
these are great for pulling the text
along<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.149> line<00:01:47.359> now<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:47.990> make<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.320> go<00:01:48.560> quicker

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
along the line now to make it go quicker

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.440 
along the line now to make it go quicker
it's<00:01:49.100> often<00:01:49.399> better<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.729> hold<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> shift<00:01:50.299> key

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
it's often better to hold the shift key

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.289 
it's often better to hold the shift key
so<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.320> hold<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.560> shift<00:01:51.799> key<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.280> drag<00:01:52.939> I

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
so if I hold the shift key and drag I

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.819 
so if I hold the shift key and drag I
can<00:01:53.780> make<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.020> text<00:01:54.340> animate<00:01:55.369> along<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.880> line

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
can make the text animate along the line

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.429 
can make the text animate along the line
so<00:01:57.829> that's<00:01:57.950> one<00:01:58.310> path<00:01:58.609> and<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.570> last<00:02:00.020> margin

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
so that's one path and the last margin

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.779 
so that's one path and the last margin
will<00:02:00.560> do<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.799> same<00:02:00.979> sort<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.340> thing

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
will do the same sort of thing

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.020 
will do the same sort of thing
now<00:02:02.719> how<00:02:03.049> about<00:02:03.259> using<00:02:03.499> another<00:02:03.950> mask<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:04.909> I

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
now how about using another mask so if I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.870 
now how about using another mask so if I
get<00:02:05.179> rid<00:02:05.299> of<00:02:05.359> that<00:02:05.509> mask<00:02:06.369> hit<00:02:07.369> delete

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
get rid of that mask hit delete

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.060 
get rid of that mask hit delete
instantly<00:02:08.630> I've<00:02:08.810> got<00:02:08.990> no<00:02:09.140> masks<00:02:09.560> left<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.039> I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
instantly I've got no masks left but I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.520 
instantly I've got no masks left but I
could<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.670> wanted<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> choose<00:02:11.480> an<00:02:11.810> ellipse

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
could if I wanted to choose an ellipse

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.610 
could if I wanted to choose an ellipse

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
path select mask 1 which is now the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.750 
path select mask 1 which is now the
ellipse<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:24.920> holding<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.490> shift<00:02:25.700> key
