00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.489
 folder like this we enter the folder 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.260
 and good here will come three files 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.320
 we copy the three files 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.290
 right mouse copy and good we 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.000
 we will go where we have the topics of 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.000
 windows that would be my pc 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.930
 local disk 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.359
 windows 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.159
 and here we open 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:30.120
 restored this folder we opened it 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.630
 and well here would be the theme folder 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.910
 here but here we would get the three 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.910
 files that we copy we give you sticks 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.680
 and good and good to me it turns out that if I 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.870
 I want to replace, I will give it not 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.180
 because I already have you not 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.420
 they will say no no no nothing will come out of this 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.980
 they only stick it and already good I will give it 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.110
 cancel and good has already stuck in the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.940
 themes folder of our windows what 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 What we will do is give a right click of the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.760
 mouse properties 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.020
 and we will open screen properties 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.020
 we select here in modified theme and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.840
 we look for the theme that says iris aries 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.820
 because if we choose the small one is going to see 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.280
 more skinny and good to me I like it more 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.680
 that looks like windows 7 style like this 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.780
 as I have it now and well what 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 we select and we apply 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.350
 there the subject is being put 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.810
 and well here would be the subject put 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.650
 It has very good and good as you can see 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.709
 fine cool the subject not only for the by the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.989
 character but also for the theme but 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.330
