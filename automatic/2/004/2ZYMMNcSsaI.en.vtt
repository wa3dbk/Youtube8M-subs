hi I'm Yolanda Shannon I'm an engineer
at<00:00:11.519> Bugaboo<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.959> working<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.379> the<00:00:13.499> Bugaboo

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
at Bugaboo I'm working on the Bugaboo

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.220 
at Bugaboo I'm working on the Bugaboo
Cameleon<00:00:13.919> 3<00:00:14.490> project<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.480> always<00:00:15.900> want<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
Cameleon 3 project we always want to

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.500 
Cameleon 3 project we always want to
improve<00:00:16.530> ourselves<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:19.880> we<00:00:20.880> still<00:00:21.180> think

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
improve ourselves and we still think

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.270 
improve ourselves and we still think
there's<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:22.230> are<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:22.530> things<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.950> we

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
there's there are some things that we

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.880 
there's there are some things that we
can<00:00:23.460> improve<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:24.060> strength<00:00:24.780> strength<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
can improve on strength strength and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.430 
can improve on strength strength and
stiffness<00:00:26.150> robustness<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> product<00:00:27.840> I'm

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
stiffness robustness of the product I'm

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.340 
stiffness robustness of the product I'm
currently<00:00:29.150> working<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.110> central

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
currently working on the the central

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.850 
currently working on the the central
joint<00:00:31.620> that's<00:00:32.340> how<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.579> call<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.560> this<00:00:34.560> part

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
joint that's how we call this this part

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
joint that's how we call this this part
of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> Schroder<00:00:35.930> it's<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> backbone

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
of the Schroder it's like the backbone

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
of the Schroder it's like the backbone
of<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:38.010> whole<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.760> complete<00:00:39.090> stroller

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
of the whole of the complete stroller

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.470 
of the whole of the complete stroller
where<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> handlebar<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> front<00:00:42.000> back

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
where the handlebar the front back

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680 
where the handlebar the front back
wheels<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.470> seat<00:00:43.710> come<00:00:44.010> together<00:00:44.690> we've

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
wheels and the seat come together we've

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.610 
wheels and the seat come together we've
improved<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.060> few<00:00:48.720> points<00:00:48.930> well<00:00:49.560> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
improved it on a few points well the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.569 
improved it on a few points well the
design<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.540> different<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.340> here

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
design is is different what we see here

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
design is is different what we see here
is<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.790> have<00:00:53.940> four<00:00:54.300> four<00:00:54.780> disks<00:00:55.200> where<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.160> have

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
is we have four four disks where we have

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.840 
is we have four four disks where we have
integrated<00:00:56.940> two<00:00:57.510> into<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.739> yeah<00:00:59.579> which

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
integrated two into one which yeah which

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.930 
integrated two into one which yeah which
makes<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:02.090> bit<00:01:03.090> simpler<00:01:04.640> another<00:01:05.640> thing

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
makes it a bit bit simpler another thing

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.610 
makes it a bit bit simpler another thing
is<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.120> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.440> the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
is that you can see is it here that the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.160 
is that you can see is it here that the
we<00:01:08.280> call<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:09.120> parts<00:01:09.479> joints<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
we call these these parts joints and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.500 
we call these these parts joints and
they<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.040> aluminium<00:01:11.270> here<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> can

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
they go into the aluminium here you can

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
they go into the aluminium here you can
see<00:01:12.690> they<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.960> over<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.320> aluminium<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
see they go over the aluminium and that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.740 
see they go over the aluminium and that
is<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:16.760> these<00:01:17.760> parts<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.360> stronger

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is to make these parts much stronger

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.680 
is to make these parts much stronger
that<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.560> determine<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.220> much<00:01:20.479> forces<00:01:21.479> come

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
that we determine how much forces come

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.320 
that we determine how much forces come
on<00:01:21.840> these<00:01:22.020> parts<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:24.060> dark

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
on these parts so you can see in dark

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.590 
on these parts so you can see in dark
blue<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:26.340> areas<00:01:26.729> where<00:01:27.000> there's<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.510> lot

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
blue the areas where there's not a lot

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.429 
blue the areas where there's not a lot
of<00:01:27.840> force<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> blue<00:01:29.850> until<00:01:30.540> yellow<00:01:31.229> or

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
of force and the blue until yellow or

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
of force and the blue until yellow or
red<00:01:31.680> where<00:01:32.400> there<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.150> weather<00:01:33.330> is<00:01:33.570> more

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
red where there the weather is more

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880 
red where there the weather is more
force<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.920> forces<00:01:35.490> occur<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.890> situation

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
force these forces occur in a situation

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.670 
force these forces occur in a situation
where<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.810> maximum<00:01:40.229> weight<00:01:40.470> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
where you have the the maximum weight in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.510 
where you have the the maximum weight in
the<00:01:40.830> seat<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.600> 17<00:01:42.600> kilos<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:44.280> have

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the seat which is 17 kilos and you have

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.499 
the seat which is 17 kilos and you have
another<00:01:45.420> 4<00:01:45.780> kilos<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> young<00:01:46.560> feedback<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
another 4 kilos and young feedback and

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.899 
another 4 kilos and young feedback and
when<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:51.439> handlebar<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.909> forest

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
when you put the handlebar in the forest

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.789 
when you put the handlebar in the forest
position<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.770> when<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.100> tilt<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
position and when you then tilt the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.969 
position and when you then tilt the
stroller<00:01:59.720> then<00:02:00.720> there<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> maximum<00:02:01.650> force

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
stroller then there is a maximum force

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.880 
stroller then there is a maximum force
here<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.329> point<00:02:03.570> between<00:02:04.500> design

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
here on this this point between design

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.770 
here on this this point between design
and<00:02:04.920> engineering

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and engineering

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.199 
and engineering
yeah<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.009> our<00:02:08.039> own<00:02:08.189> our<00:02:09.060> own

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
yeah we we all have our own our own

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.600 
yeah we we all have our own our own
interest<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:10.229> me<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> mechanical<00:02:11.489> engineer

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
interest for me as a mechanical engineer

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.180 
interest for me as a mechanical engineer
my<00:02:12.599> interest<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
my interest is is that it's the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.610 
my interest is is that it's the
works<00:02:14.490> perfectly<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.530> is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
works perfectly and that it's a that is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.840 
works perfectly and that it's a that is
robust<00:02:17.150> strong<00:02:18.150> enough<00:02:18.740> for<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.340> design<00:02:20.670> it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
robust strong enough for the design it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.440 
robust strong enough for the design it
has<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> look<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> Bugaboo<00:02:23.450> so

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
has to look like a like a Bugaboo so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
has to look like a like a Bugaboo so
there's<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.020> discussions<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.070> we<00:02:26.190> have

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
there's a lot of discussions and we have

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.060 
there's a lot of discussions and we have
to<00:02:26.490> yeah<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.330> find<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.070> combine

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
to yeah we have to find a way to combine
