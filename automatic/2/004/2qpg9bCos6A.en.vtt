them<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> cage

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.900 

very<00:00:57.300> nice<00:00:58.070> animal<00:00:59.070> let's<00:00:59.370> look<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
very nice animal let's look at in a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.229 
very nice animal let's look at in a
little<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.170> Triceratops<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
little bit the Triceratops and as the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.530 
little bit the Triceratops and as the
limbs<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.930> move<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.939> then<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> head<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
limbs that move and then the head that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.190 
limbs that move and then the head that
moves<00:01:06.799> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.979> position<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> legs<00:01:09.750> like

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
moves you can position the legs like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.390 
moves you can position the legs like
that<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> head<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.500> move<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> all

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that and in the head you can move it all

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.350 
that and in the head you can move it all
kinds<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.670> move<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> head<00:01:18.119> up

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
kinds of little you can move the head up

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.980 
kinds of little you can move the head up
and<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.960> bit<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.750> much

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and down a little bit so that not much

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.760 
and down a little bit so that not much
side<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> side<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.180> let<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.450> down<00:01:24.770> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
side to side and just let them down you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.460 
side to side and just let them down you
can<00:01:25.920> rotate<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
can rotate it like that so that is the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.920 
can rotate it like that so that is the
Triceratops

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
Triceratops

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.850 
Triceratops
it's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.110> coal<00:01:34.380> true

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
it's a coal true

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
it's a coal true
Triceratops

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.670 

the<00:01:38.510> Dino<00:01:38.780> theme<00:01:40.810> did<00:01:41.810> really<00:01:42.050> good<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:42.380> think

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
the Dino theme did really good I think

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.580 
the Dino theme did really good I think
it's<00:01:42.830> better<00:01:43.040> than<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.520> previous<00:01:43.790> Dino<00:01:44.590> sits

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's better than the previous Dino sits

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.390 
it's better than the previous Dino sits
and<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.700> was<00:01:46.940> 2010<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:48.979> came<00:01:49.250> out

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
and this was 2010 that these came out

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.760 
and this was 2010 that these came out
now<00:01:49.910> 2012<00:01:50.479> that's<00:01:51.170> when<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.500> set<00:01:51.740> came<00:01:51.979> out<00:01:52.220> I

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
now 2012 that's when this set came out I

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.900 
now 2012 that's when this set came out I
always<00:01:54.770> get<00:01:55.010> confused<00:01:55.430> because<00:01:55.520> there's<00:01:55.790> the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
always get confused because there's the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.190 
always get confused because there's the
Dino<00:01:56.180> 2010<00:01:56.869> sets<00:01:57.350> they<00:01:57.590> came<00:01:57.800> out<00:01:58.570> not<00:01:59.570> in<00:01:59.600> 2010

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
Dino 2010 sets they came out not in 2010

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.730 
Dino 2010 sets they came out not in 2010

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
basically the cage part comes it can

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.530 
basically the cage part comes it can
come<00:03:11.269> off<00:03:11.299> like<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.269> have<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
come off like that so you can have the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.170 
come off like that so you can have the
cage<00:03:14.780> separate<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.430> we'll<00:03:16.579> look<00:03:16.730> at<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.970> cage

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
cage separate so we'll look at the cage

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.460 
cage separate so we'll look at the cage
it's<00:03:17.600> just<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.930> real<00:03:18.140> simple<00:03:18.860> bill<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
it's just a real simple bill this is the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.350 
it's just a real simple bill this is the
Dino<00:03:21.709> sets<00:03:22.040> are<00:03:22.510> really<00:03:23.510> good<00:03:23.750> because<00:03:24.140> adults

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
Dino sets are really good because adults

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.250 
Dino sets are really good because adults
and<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.630> falls<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.260> know<00:03:27.290> adult<00:03:27.799> fans<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.160> Lego

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
and a falls you know adult fans of Lego

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.380 
and a falls you know adult fans of Lego
will<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.530> them<00:03:30.799> but<00:03:31.519> they're<00:03:31.790> really

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
will like them but they're really

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.319 
will like them but they're really
designed<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:33.140> be<00:03:33.230> built<00:03:33.500> by<00:03:33.769> children<00:03:34.280> 6<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.000> 12

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
designed to be built by children 6 to 12

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.150 
designed to be built by children 6 to 12
so<00:03:35.750> that's<00:03:36.260> why<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.530> got<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.769> lot<00:03:36.890> of<00:03:36.920> big

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
so that's why you got a lot of big

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.210 
so that's why you got a lot of big
pieces<00:03:37.430> like<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.470> think<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.860> really

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
pieces like this so I think it's really

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.850 
pieces like this so I think it's really
it's<00:03:40.790> really<00:03:40.910> good<00:03:41.329> I<00:03:41.570> mean<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:42.350> doesn't<00:03:42.560> look

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
it's really good I mean it doesn't look

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.949 
it's really good I mean it doesn't look
too<00:03:43.070> toys<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.790> me<00:03:43.970> some<00:03:44.510> people<00:03:44.660> may<00:03:44.930> think

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
too toys to me some people may think

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.530 
too toys to me some people may think
it's<00:03:45.350> toys<00:03:45.620> looking<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:46.880> think<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.329> looks

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
it's toys looking but I think it looks

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.100 
it's toys looking but I think it looks
pretty

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
pretty

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.520 
pretty
so<00:03:48.380> put<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.220> Triceratops<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.180> like<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.170> I

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so put the Triceratops in like that I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.340 
so put the Triceratops in like that I
set<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.700> side<00:03:52.880> for<00:03:53.180> now<00:03:53.210> show<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
set it to the side for now show you the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.240 
set it to the side for now show you the
inside<00:03:55.120> not<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.180> lot<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:56.630> detail<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.560> still<00:03:58.070> see

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
inside not a lot of detail you still see

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.460 
inside not a lot of detail you still see
all<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.430> Technic<00:03:58.970> pieces<00:03:59.270> sitting<00:04:00.200> around

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
all the Technic pieces sitting around

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.000 
all the Technic pieces sitting around
there<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.660> think<00:04:03.140> this<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.440> where<00:04:03.590> your<00:04:03.770> guy

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
there but I think this is where your guy

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.560 
there but I think this is where your guy
can<00:04:04.280> stand<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.760> operate<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:07.330> flick<00:04:08.330> fire

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
can stand and operate the flick fire

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.410 
can stand and operate the flick fire
missiles<00:04:09.050> they're<00:04:09.490> got<00:04:10.490> a<00:04:10.520> shovel<00:04:10.880> on<00:04:11.210> this

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
missiles they're got a shovel on this

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.150 
missiles they're got a shovel on this
side<00:04:12.250> your<00:04:13.250> step<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:15.800> on<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.010> other

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
side your step and then on the other

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.810 
side your step and then on the other
side<00:04:16.580> is<00:04:16.880> his<00:04:17.180> axe<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.290> then<00:04:19.280> we<00:04:19.370> can<00:04:19.549> slide

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
side is his axe and then we can slide

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.870 
side is his axe and then we can slide
this<00:04:20.090> oxo<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.780> should<00:04:20.959> show<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.170> the<00:04:21.880> area

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
this oxo I should show you the area

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.920 
this oxo I should show you the area
where<00:04:23.060> they<00:04:23.150> drive<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> lot<00:04:26.330> going<00:04:26.630> on<00:04:26.720> in
