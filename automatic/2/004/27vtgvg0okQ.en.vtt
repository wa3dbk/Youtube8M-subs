before maybe twice one I had somebody do
it<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.279> me<00:00:26.490> once<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> professional<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

nothing really to it was a really
physical<00:00:31.019> strain<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.980> I'll<00:00:32.399> use<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.880> flat

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
physical strain so I'll use this flat

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160 
physical strain so I'll use this flat
iron<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.480> supposed<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> get<00:00:33.809> super
