00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.570
 t 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 what do you want to do 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.930
 the truth makes you want to stay 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.620
 suppose that tomÃ¡s would like to leave behind the stressful biologist ana and 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.750
 start again here in the pocket 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.660
 nothing is done nothing nothing 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.240
 I said suppose 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 if it fits because it means something very close between now 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 The hole is not missing and I'm ready for Malaga 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.590
 the graduate describes what we are seeing 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.890
 the one that is all good 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 that citizen origin unit 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.380
 what we are seeing 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.100
 the government wants the research and teaching center in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.560
 encounter attend 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.890
 efe 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.250
 compos is a way to imitate nature by producing a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.900
 control planning 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.820
 so they did not have even more artificially 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 by biochemical decomposition of organic waste 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380
 a fertile soil a hectare of surface and 30 centimeters of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.230
 depth 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.290
 can contain more than seven and a half tons of living beings 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.130
 bacteria pongos protozoa arias same all a worm c insects 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 these organisms fulfill the function of recycling the organic matter present 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.190
 in the dead body of other organisms or in their droppings 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.380
 carry out the mineralization process which transforms the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.950
 organic matter in inorganic compounds 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.759
 these English nutrients are absorbed by the roots for the restart of the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.610
 cycle 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.270
 the pillar compos is the most used in these areas 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.710
 wooden walls in the shape of a follow to retain moisture 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.839
 The compostelas are a factory that transform organic waste into 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.379
 fertile land 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.729
 the proportion is recommended to assemble the ditch 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.029
 one third of dry material next to fast ferry 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:28.349
 one third of green material as a red shepherd regarding if nothing 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.249
 and a third of good quality land to provide the mechanisms that 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.229
 accelerate decomposition 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:41.199
 all this should add animal manure to provide nitrogen and should 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.479
 watering often followed by cristina the necessary humidity 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:49.459
 if the compost has been well started the temperature will rise to 55 or 60 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.109
 degrees in three or four days this process kills most of the 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.109
 pathogenic microorganisms 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.929
 at 22 30 days the temperature starts 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.329
 lower indicating a decrease in the decomposition process 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.340
 this is the time to turn the compost to mix the cold edges 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.059
 with the warm interior 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:15.809
 this turning allows to finish with the fermentation at two months begins 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.109
 maturation 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.109
 which shows a lot of beneficial insect worms that 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.209
 they ingest the rest of the organic matter and complete the work of the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.090
 fungi imitate years 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.690
 then with the compost in a few months we achieved what nature 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.469
 takes thousands of years 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.069
 the omnibus is added the earth as fertilizer and contributes innumerable 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.340
 Benefits 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.400
 we have would be to improve the structure of the soil 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.910
 increase the redenciÃ³n of water in sandy soils and facilitating in the third 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.079
 exercise is the bus there that to the ground and prevents erosion 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.689
 mv feeds microfauna and provides nutrients 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.230
 instead of celestial cut the cheekbones to the head
