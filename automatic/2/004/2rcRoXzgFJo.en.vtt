 worry simple 1 cup of rice per 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.860
 a three-quarter cup of water takes you to

 questions was telling me that they do 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.320
 rice with milk but they are very hard 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.720
 what happens is that they do not leave it 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.150
 enough time cooking is a matter of 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 leave it as long as necessary 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.030

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.500
 the amount depending on the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.440
