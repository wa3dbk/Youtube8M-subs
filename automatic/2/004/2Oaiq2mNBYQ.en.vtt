for a lot of x99 parts has gone down so

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.850 
for a lot of x99 parts has gone down so
we're<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> take<00:00:42.960> advantage<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.680> that

parts that i picked out here so starting
with<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> cpu<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.820> much<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> no-brainer

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
with the cpu is pretty much a no-brainer

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.570 
with the cpu is pretty much a no-brainer

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
gigahertz the same is pretty much going

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
gigahertz the same is pretty much going
to<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.259> monster<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.580> whatever<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.240> needed

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to be a monster in whatever you needed

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
to be a monster in whatever you needed
to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.470> would<00:01:19.619> definitely<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:20.189> something

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
to do this would definitely be something

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
to do this would definitely be something
that<00:01:20.640> will<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.689> helpful<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.049> someone<00:01:22.439> that's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that will be helpful for someone that's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.310 
that will be helpful for someone that's
doing<00:01:23.220> video<00:01:23.790> editing<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.049> you're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
doing video editing like me if you're

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.730 
doing video editing like me if you're
gaming<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.490> an<00:01:26.700> x<00:01:26.909> 99<00:01:27.270> build<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
gaming pretty much an x 99 build is in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
gaming pretty much an x 99 build is in
itself<00:01:29.250> overkill<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.450> you're<00:01:30.570> doing

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
itself overkill but if you're doing

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
itself overkill but if you're doing
something<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.650> side<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
something on the side with that then it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.109 
something on the side with that then it
makes<00:01:33.630> sense<00:01:33.750> 20<00:01:34.229> x<00:01:34.710> 99<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.850> an

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
makes sense 20 x 99 or if you're just an

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.450 
makes sense 20 x 99 or if you're just an
enthusiast<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.350> best<00:01:38.189> thing

because<00:02:36.330> we're<00:02:36.510> building<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.989> budget<00:02:37.709> system

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890

so<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.730> case<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.150> get<00:02:39.269> quite<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.050> bit<00:02:40.290> of

it'd be a good idea to go ahead and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.979 
it'd be a good idea to go ahead and

incorporate that into a bill if you're

incorporate that into a bill if you're
going<00:02:49.110> x<00:02:49.350> 99<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.040> makes<00:02:50.250> sense<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.610> have<00:02:50.910> the

you're<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.060> see<00:03:45.239> these<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.690> all<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.079> my

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
you're going to see these in all of my

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.380 
you're going to see these in all of my
builds<00:03:46.680> because<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> best<00:03:47.400> bang<00:03:48.359> for

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
builds because it's the best bang for

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.050 
builds because it's the best bang for
the<00:03:48.660> buck<00:03:48.690> SATA<00:03:49.260> based<00:03:49.560> SSD<00:03:50.340> available<00:03:50.910> right

now<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.570> we're<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.019> with<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.350> 500<00:03:53.130> gigabyte

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
now and we're going with a 500 gigabyte

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.210 
now and we're going with a 500 gigabyte
drive<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.600> plenty<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.200> storage<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.190> your

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.580 
drive so plenty of storage for your
programs<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.090> things<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.379> that

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
programs and things like that so that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.470 
programs and things like that so that
will<00:03:58.739> get<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.069> started<00:03:59.400> there<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.060> then<00:04:00.360> if

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
will get you started there and then if

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.830 
will get you started there and then if
you<00:04:00.569> need<00:04:00.810> more<00:04:01.590> storage<00:04:01.920> for<00:04:02.640> maybe<00:04:03.330> saving

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
you need more storage for maybe saving

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.460 
you need more storage for maybe saving
those

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
those

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.860 
those

drive<00:04:09.630> again<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.470> just<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.710> pretty<00:04:10.950> basic

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
drive again this is just a pretty basic

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.490 
drive again this is just a pretty basic
drive<00:04:11.640> for<00:04:11.970> some<00:04:12.180> extra<00:04:12.570> storage<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.260> then

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
drive for some extra storage and then

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.310 
drive for some extra storage and then
moving<00:04:13.680> along<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.460> GPU<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.570> in<00:04:15.870> this<00:04:16.079> case

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
moving along to the GPU so in this case

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.210 
moving along to the GPU so in this case
I<00:04:16.680> originally<00:04:17.310> had<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.760> GTX<00:04:18.390> 980<00:04:19.049> selected<00:04:19.859> but

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
I originally had a GTX 980 selected but

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.410 
I originally had a GTX 980 selected but
the<00:04:20.579> radeon<00:04:21.269> r9<00:04:21.510> 390<00:04:22.500> x<00:04:22.860> actually<00:04:23.820> performs

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
the radeon r9 390 x actually performs

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.860 
the radeon r9 390 x actually performs
nearly<00:04:25.170> as<00:04:25.350> good<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:26.340> it's<00:04:26.520> much<00:04:26.820> cheaper<00:04:26.870> so

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
nearly as good but it's much cheaper so

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.930 
nearly as good but it's much cheaper so
you<00:04:28.140> get<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.800> much<00:04:29.040> better<00:04:29.070> bang<00:04:29.550> for<00:04:29.580> your<00:04:29.880> buck

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
you get a much better bang for your buck

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.590 
you get a much better bang for your buck
by<00:04:30.330> going<00:04:30.630> with<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.080> r9<00:04:31.830> 390<00:04:32.310> x<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.180> it'll<00:04:33.510> do

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
by going with the r9 390 x so it'll do

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.230 
by going with the r9 390 x so it'll do
you<00:04:33.720> well<00:04:33.900> also<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.710> rendering<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:36.000> will<00:04:36.090> help

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
you well also in rendering it will help

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.940 
you well also in rendering it will help
with<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.570> if<00:04:36.630> you're<00:04:36.870> doing<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.260> GPU<00:04:37.680> based

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
with that if you're doing a GPU based

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.380 
with that if you're doing a GPU based
rendering<00:04:38.220> which<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.730> really<00:04:38.970> should<00:04:39.210> be

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
rendering which you really should be

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.930 
rendering which you really should be
it's<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.810> lot<00:04:39.960> faster<00:04:40.200> than<00:04:40.760> doing<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.820> with

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
it's a lot faster than doing it with

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.200 
it's a lot faster than doing it with
your<00:04:42.060> CPU<00:04:42.480> so<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.410> r9<00:04:43.980> 390<00:04:44.370> X<00:04:44.610> it's

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
your CPU so I like the r9 390 X it's

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.790 
your CPU so I like the r9 390 X it's
good<00:04:45.360> for<00:04:45.540> gaming<00:04:45.720> it's<00:04:46.230> good<00:04:46.410> for<00:04:46.590> video

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
good for gaming it's good for video

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.400 
good for gaming it's good for video
editing<00:04:46.980> nice<00:04:47.880> bang<00:04:48.150> for<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.450> buck<00:04:48.480> there<00:04:48.900> so

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
editing nice bang for the buck there so

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.920 
editing nice bang for the buck there so
that<00:04:49.590> would<00:04:49.710> be<00:04:49.740> my<00:04:50.070> choice<00:04:50.600> also<00:04:51.600> if<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.810> go

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
that would be my choice also if you go

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.650 
that would be my choice also if you go
with<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.170> sapphire<00:04:52.650> card<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.280> think<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.120> looks

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
with the sapphire card I think it looks

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.450 
with the sapphire card I think it looks
pretty<00:04:54.720> nice<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.680> course<00:04:55.710> I've<00:04:56.070> got<00:04:56.250> that

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
pretty nice and of course I've got that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.950 
pretty nice and of course I've got that

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
watt version which I don't think is

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.730 
watt version which I don't think is
released<00:05:17.370> yet<00:05:17.640> but<00:05:17.850> it's<00:05:18.750> pretty<00:05:18.990> solid<00:05:19.290> it's

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
released yet but it's pretty solid it's

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.820 
released yet but it's pretty solid it's
also<00:05:19.890> got<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.370> hybrid<00:05:21.210> button<00:05:21.570> so<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:22.050> can<00:05:22.440> set

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
also got a hybrid button so you can set

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.710 
also got a hybrid button so you can set
it<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:22.979> where<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.400> fan<00:05:23.610> only<00:05:23.790> spins<00:05:24.210> up<00:05:24.419> after

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
it to where the fan only spins up after

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.270 
it to where the fan only spins up after
it<00:05:24.810> reaches<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.110> certain<00:05:25.380> load<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:26.040> if<00:05:26.130> you're

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
it reaches a certain load so if you're

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.640 
it reaches a certain load so if you're
concerned<00:05:26.490> about<00:05:26.640> noise<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.900> good<00:05:28.440> option

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
concerned about noise it's a good option

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.280 
concerned about noise it's a good option

they're so pretty solid power supply I
think<00:05:31.530> will<00:05:31.770> fit<00:05:32.040> well<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.510> build<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
think will fit well in this build and

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.690 
think will fit well in this build and
then<00:05:34.470> we're<00:05:34.560> going<00:05:34.650> to<00:05:34.710> stuff<00:05:34.950> that<00:05:34.979> all<00:05:35.250> into

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
then we're going to stuff that all into

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.010 
then we're going to stuff that all into

of the best bang for your buck cases out
there<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.950> so<00:05:47.640> that<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.180> why<00:05:48.300> I've<00:05:48.390> chosen<00:05:48.419> it

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
there and so that is why I've chosen it

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.240 
there and so that is why I've chosen it
just<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.320> be<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:49.440> little<00:05:49.500> bit<00:05:49.710> different<00:05:50.100> we're

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
just to be a little bit different we're

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.240 
just to be a little bit different we're
going<00:05:50.280> with<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.910> white<00:05:51.570> version<00:05:51.840> but<00:05:52.350> you<00:05:53.100> can

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
going with the white version but you can

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.700 
going with the white version but you can
go<00:05:53.340> with<00:05:53.520> whatever<00:05:53.729> color<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:54.780> want<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:55.470> do

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
go with whatever color you want I do

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.250 
go with whatever color you want I do
have<00:05:56.130> this<00:05:56.160> case<00:05:56.720> personally<00:05:57.720> here<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.140> I<00:05:58.200> do

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
have this case personally here and I do

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.230 
have this case personally here and I do
like<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.770> lot<00:05:58.950> not<00:05:59.310> my<00:05:59.430> favorite<00:05:59.640> fantex

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
like it a lot not my favorite fantex

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.969 
like it a lot not my favorite fantex
case<00:06:00.570> but<00:06:00.900> I<00:06:00.930> think<00:06:01.290> in<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.470> bit<00:06:01.650> like<00:06:01.800> this

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
case but I think in a bit like this

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.590 
case but I think in a bit like this
especially<00:06:02.160> a<00:06:02.490> budget<00:06:02.910> one<00:06:03.060> you're<00:06:03.330> really

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
especially a budget one you're really

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.090 
especially a budget one you're really
getting<00:06:03.810> your<00:06:03.960> money's<00:06:04.290> worth<00:06:04.320> going<00:06:04.950> with

getting your money's worth going with

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.230 
getting your money's worth going with
something<00:06:05.370> like<00:06:05.520> this<00:06:05.729> because<00:06:05.970> it's<00:06:06.120> got

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
something like this because it's got

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.960 
something like this because it's got
plenty<00:06:06.450> of<00:06:06.630> drive<00:06:06.990> space<00:06:07.380> plenty<00:06:07.979> of<00:06:08.250> air<00:06:08.490> flow

of<00:06:13.680> front<00:06:13.919> io<00:06:14.099> USB<00:06:14.940> ports<00:06:15.330> so<00:06:15.630> pretty<00:06:16.320> solid

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
of front io USB ports so pretty solid

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.060 
of front io USB ports so pretty solid
case<00:06:17.600> altogether<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.500> so<00:06:18.620> that's<00:06:18.890> pretty

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
case altogether and so that's pretty

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.040 
case altogether and so that's pretty
much<00:06:19.250> what<00:06:19.700> I<00:06:19.910> would<00:06:20.120> be<00:06:20.240> building<00:06:20.600> if<00:06:20.720> I<00:06:20.840> had

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
much what I would be building if I had

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.020 
much what I would be building if I had
eighteen<00:06:21.590> hundred<00:06:21.890> dollars<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.460> I<00:06:22.880> was

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
eighteen hundred dollars and I was

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.480 
eighteen hundred dollars and I was
deciding<00:06:23.300> to<00:06:23.540> put<00:06:23.720> together<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:24.230> PC<00:06:24.920> even<00:06:25.310> if<00:06:25.400> I

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
deciding to put together a PC even if I

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.990 
deciding to put together a PC even if I
didn't<00:06:25.790> need<00:06:26.350> x99<00:06:27.400> it<00:06:28.400> just<00:06:28.610> kind<00:06:28.790> of<00:06:28.820> makes

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
didn't need x99 it just kind of makes

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.050 
didn't need x99 it just kind of makes
