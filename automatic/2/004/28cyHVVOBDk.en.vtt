one but it's the first track that I ever
released<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.300> MX<00:00:21.779> simulator<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
released actually in MX simulator and it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.279 
released actually in MX simulator and it
was<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.820> meant<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.449> fun<00:00:24.810> local

times and it's just got some like

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.889 
times and it's just got some like
loosely<00:00:54.329> based<00:00:54.510> sand<00:00:55.370> as<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.760> dirt<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> some

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
people don't like the traction but if

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.560 
people don't like the traction but if
you<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.460> used<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.879> after<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.149> while<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> think

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you get used to it after a while I think

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.880 
you get used to it after a while I think
it's<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.840> fun<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> come<00:01:01.620> over<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it's pretty fun but you come over the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
it's pretty fun but you come over the
finish<00:01:02.039> line<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.730> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> swooping

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
finish line into this kind of swooping

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.679 
finish line into this kind of swooping
left-hand<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.439> corner<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.270> little<00:01:06.270> double

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
left-hand first corner a little double

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.020 
left-hand first corner a little double
into<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.619> an<00:01:07.799> inside-outside<00:01:08.369> option<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
into like an inside-outside option you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
into like an inside-outside option you
go<00:01:09.119> outside<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.840> double<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:10.770> rail

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
go outside and like double and then rail

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.170 
go outside and like double and then rail
round<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> corner<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> got<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
round that corner and then you got this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.560 
round that corner and then you got this
up<00:01:12.390> hill<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.869> scrub<00:01:13.439> table<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
up hill to the scrub table and then you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.030 
up hill to the scrub table and then you
have<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> split<00:01:16.080> section<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.740> could<00:01:16.950> go

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have a split section here you could go

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.760 
have a split section here you could go
outside<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.720> drop<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
outside and and like just drop down to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350 
outside and and like just drop down to
the<00:01:19.860> outside<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.430> inside<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.119> hit<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the outside or go inside and hit the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
the outside or go inside and hit the
little<00:01:21.509> roller<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> hit<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> inside<00:01:22.380> rut<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
little roller and hit the inside rut and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
little roller and hit the inside rut and
some<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:24.030> loops<00:01:24.420> kinda<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
some like little loops kinda and you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
some like little loops kinda and you
have<00:01:25.259> inside<00:01:25.619> rollers<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.340> outside<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
have inside rollers or go outside and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.130 
have inside rollers or go outside and
then<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.270> triple<00:01:27.990> triple<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.369> quad<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.270> ten

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
then I triple triple and quad this ten

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
then I triple triple and quad this ten
package<00:01:31.560> jumps<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.130> hard<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> do

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
package jumps which it's very hard to do

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
package jumps which it's very hard to do
that<00:01:33.060> line<00:01:33.360> actually<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.170> pretty<00:01:34.320> lucky

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that line actually I'm pretty lucky

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.249 
that line actually I'm pretty lucky
doing<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.189> lap<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:36.720> swoop<00:01:36.930> around<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
doing it that lap you swoop around a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
doing it that lap you swoop around a
u-turn<00:01:37.619> over<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> little<00:01:38.250> step<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.670> double<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
u-turn over a little step up double and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.020 
u-turn over a little step up double and
then<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> drop<00:01:40.200> down<00:01:40.409> table<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.670> dip

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
then a drop down table into a little dip

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
then a drop down table into a little dip
and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> step<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.290> double<00:01:43.829> table

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and then like a step up double table

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
and then like a step up double table
thing<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> cool<00:01:45.509> split<00:01:45.869> section<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
thing and then a cool split section here

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.960 
thing and then a cool split section here
you<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.590> inside<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:47.220> outside<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:47.880> the
