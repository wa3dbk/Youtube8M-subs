00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.790
 in front of false mails eliana sweet today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.220
 again a very simple one 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.939
 nail design and this very beautiful 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.070
 simply strip nails with the help of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.109
 we'll probably strip you off 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 already knows my last nail design 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.760
 I am totally worthless what this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 masking tape, however 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.950
 has a very nice subscriber of 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 me a great tip and given the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.160
 I will share with you today so 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 just stay tuned and look at it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.450
 so for this merkel design you need 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.230
 then first of all color shades for yours 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.879
 fingernails 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.680
 Of course you can only give it a shade 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.480
 he or she does it like me here 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.950
 For example, on the ring finger or a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 other finger painted her just yet 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 got another color so as a small 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.410
 highlight there underneath and of course 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 you also need to give it later 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 an under and over paint as well 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.750
 a nail polish color as an effect I have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 you have chosen silver here but you can 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.979
 Of course, any other use and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.710
 then, of course, adhesive film and scissors 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.500
 and right at the beginning we come now 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.049
 also to the great tip and that as you 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 see is a little something now 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.920
 unlike usual and that are mine 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.920
 Nails already painted that's me 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 have the subject with the reason 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.880
 shades that I wanted to wear 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.970
 already on it given and that I have 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 that already made last night 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 because the super great guy of mine 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.570
 dear subscriber was just a day 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.409
 long with the underground nail polish colors 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.729
 to run because of my problem with the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.200
 Adhesive tape here with such if you 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.360
 then because it sticks and make pattern 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 always was that he was always with me 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 has jerked again as I and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 everything was just hate it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.610
 from there to me the tip given 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.549
 just paint my nails in the evening 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.369
 or just a day like that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.860
 before and then the next day 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.770
 pattern on it and do that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.810
 we'll just take it for now 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.270
 of course, then you guys after them 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.799
 then just a day before your nails in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.399
 the paint has painted in her like that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.650
 you want to take yours 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.799
 this film or other adhesive film the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.939
 you have and your little scissors and 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.319
 Now you think about which pattern 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.060
 you wanted to make me have a whole 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.670
 simple stripe pattern made like you 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.870
 Of course , then you are not 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.239
 limited what you wanted to do 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.379
 I thought it was simply a beautiful 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.480
 Variant and you really take it 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.189
 a sharp pair of scissors best and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.989
 cut yourselves in the form in which he 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.859
 afterwards in the pattern want to have so 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.030
 small pieces of the film to im 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:45.290
 West made that a bit 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.340
 longer and cuts the then just in 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.959
 the form 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.269
 I want to have the kiwis afterwards 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.090
 there again for the other 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.370
 side and I glue myself then on the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.389
 back of Hand 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.920
 that just helps with that 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.180
 do not stick so much adhesive tape 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.500
 that you can then get it from his 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.510
 Just do not get nailed and 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.189
 you can really work great too 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.900
 press from your own hand and then 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:14.449
 I just cut myself so much now 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.879
 to like me if you need it now 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:19.129
 have done and beautiful your whole hand 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.419
 then plastered with it then considered 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.199
 ye them that her pattern 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.940
 want to stick 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.829
 and I will hand for the left now 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.230
 use the pattern what i just here 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.599
 on this yellow finger just have yes 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.000
 to make them a bit 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.949
 more varied is that means then 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.690
 Now that I am the 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.010
 Adhesive tape as you take them in 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.150
 fit the size are always such a 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.099
 a little bigger, smaller, the whole 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.840
 Of course I'll take it for the little one 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.079
 finger 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.659
 and to get that pattern now 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.659
 I stick here and there 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.549
 So I read below what about freely in 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.530
 same distance as well as one 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.849
 Adhesive tape is the adhesive tape 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.969
 By the way, about three to four 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:14.250
 millimeter thick from the pattern 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:16.560
 I look at the next one of my hand and 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.810
 it sticks then on top is the distance 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.100
 is about the same again and up 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:30.270
 I do this finger exactly now 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:34.199
 the other way down cover it off nicely 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.910
 make sure that is straight then 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.169
 leave an adhesive-wide about freely 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.620
 so that had to be reasonably synonymous 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:45.090
 remains evenly and deliver 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.990
 you can take it off again and again 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.639
 to refine that and then 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.210
 really the glue also nice to 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:59.849
 third of all I'm doing now 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.320
 The others also came close to that 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.270
 horse I have then take yours 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:09.530
 Contrast plug in my case just here 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:11.729
 This silver is now available on the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.349
 vacant places where the color after 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.349
 of course, it should come up 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.910
 when you have that done then you leave 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.640
 that does not dry there so 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.810
 really just dry out so easily and 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.810
 then pull the glue off again 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.660
 just because if you now the 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.450
 paint on the adhesive to dry too long 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.130
 then that can be that then one man 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:56.280
 the color you just applied 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:56.280
 Go back down nicely 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.230
 after drying now the 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.090
 clearcoat 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.470
 and then we are done too 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.930
 Pay attention to that, too 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.120
 really this contrast color the now 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.340
 have dried well because 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:18.010
 otherwise it will streak naturally 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.810
 but form with adhesive strip designs 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.810
 you have to be patient 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.710
 That's how it looks now. I think so 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.450
 very nice this variant I think 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.400
 now very special by the 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.310
 pastel colors probably easy and 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.120
 also through the metal so this 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.980
 metallic look 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.940
 However, I think so too 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.620
 very nice if you are now for example 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.300
 yellow stripes give you this turquoise 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.510
 would do as it stops here 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.260
 hinted is quasi or even for the 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.600
 winter then with dark red and gold or 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.280
 with dark green and silver or something like me 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.310
 think there are totally beautiful variants 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.540
 and that's such a pretty simple one 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.800
 nail design which has a great effect 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.540
 So then I hope it's you 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.080
 I liked it again 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.670
 my dear subscribers and try it 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.350
 myself from post it maybe me 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.940
 a photo on my facebook page 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.830
 look at my other ones 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.880
 nail design sun and then we'll meet 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.880
 Just next time
