have to reset between every single rep
do<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.759> take<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.240> extra<00:02:10.539> split<00:02:10.780> second<00:02:11.230> to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
do it take the extra split second to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.470 
do it take the extra split second to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
make sure you're doing every rep out of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
stable position next big cue I want you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.320 
stable position next big cue I want you
to<00:02:15.819> focus<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.299> is<00:02:16.569> what<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.110> your<00:02:17.230> body<00:02:17.500> doing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
to focus on is what is your body doing

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.240 
to focus on is what is your body doing
once<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.540> initiate<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.140> exercise<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:20.190> if

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
once you initiate the exercise see if

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.090 
once you initiate the exercise see if
you<00:02:20.400> imagine<00:02:20.790> yourself<00:02:20.850> as<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.390> sheet<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.780> paper

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
you imagine yourself as a sheet of paper

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.470 
you imagine yourself as a sheet of paper
you<00:02:23.100> should<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.370> rolling<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.090> sheet<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you should be rolling that sheet of

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.990 
you should be rolling that sheet of
paper<00:02:24.630> up<00:02:24.930> not<00:02:25.320> folding<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.790> here

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
paper up not folding it you can see here

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.540 
paper up not folding it you can see here
the<00:02:27.150> difference<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:28.350> I'm<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:29.070> folding

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the difference here I'm actually folding

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
the difference here I'm actually folding
my<00:02:29.670> body<00:02:29.880> I'm<00:02:30.090> literally<00:02:30.330> folding<00:02:30.870> by<00:02:31.260> just

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
my body I'm literally folding by just

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.870 
my body I'm literally folding by just
really<00:02:31.710> using<00:02:31.980> my<00:02:32.010> hip<00:02:32.220> flexors<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.730> that's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
really using my hip flexors and that's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.460 
really using my hip flexors and that's
the<00:02:33.000> problem<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.780> hip<00:02:33.960> flexors<00:02:34.320> will

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the problem the hip flexors will

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.560 
the problem the hip flexors will
dominate<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.100> movement<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.210> even<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
dominate this movement and even the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.790 
dominate this movement and even the
people<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.840> do<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.170> will<00:02:37.290> say<00:02:37.410> yeah<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.650> if

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
people that do this will say yeah but if

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.320 
people that do this will say yeah but if
I<00:02:37.950> still<00:02:38.190> feel<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.730> abs<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.180> do

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
I still feel this in my abs and I do

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.820 
I still feel this in my abs and I do
that<00:02:39.510> yeah<00:02:39.960> because<00:02:40.140> your<00:02:40.410> abs<00:02:40.530> are<00:02:40.800> working

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that yeah because your abs are working

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.130 
that yeah because your abs are working
isometrically<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.060> stabilize<00:02:42.510> your<00:02:42.690> pelvis

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
isometrically that stabilize your pelvis

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
isometrically that stabilize your pelvis
as<00:02:43.290> your<00:02:43.530> femurs<00:02:43.920> rise<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.180> doesn't

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
as your femurs rise up but that doesn't

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.670 
as your femurs rise up but that doesn't
mean<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.660> they're<00:02:45.810> doing<00:02:46.080> all<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.530> they

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
mean that they're doing all that they

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410 
mean that they're doing all that they
can<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.700> where<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.880> think<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.240> have

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
can do and this is where I think we have

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420 
can do and this is where I think we have
the<00:02:48.570> big<00:02:48.750> problem<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.770> have<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> be<00:02:50.070> problem

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the big problem we have to be problem

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.550 
the big problem we have to be problem
because<00:02:50.760> you're<00:02:51.330> not<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.720> overloading

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
because you're not actually overloading

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.930 
because you're not actually overloading
your<00:02:52.590> abs<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> shortest<00:02:53.640> amount<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.880> time

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
your abs in the shortest amount of time

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.420 
your abs in the shortest amount of time
possible<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:55.110> will<00:02:55.230> take<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.560> much<00:02:55.740> longer<00:02:55.770> to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
possible it will take you much longer to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.190 
possible it will take you much longer to
fatigue<00:02:56.790> an<00:02:57.000> isometric<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.750> an<00:02:58.050> ab

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
fatigue an isometric and an ab

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.750 
fatigue an isometric and an ab
isometrically<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:59.010> would<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.370> actually

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
isometrically that would to actually

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.690 
isometrically that would to actually
fatigue<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.240> there<00:03:00.750> throughout<00:03:01.050> its<00:03:01.230> natural

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
fatigue it there throughout its natural
