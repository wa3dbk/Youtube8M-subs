tennis ball and hit you need to snap
your<00:00:09.210> wrist<00:00:09.450> because<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.990> adds<00:00:10.139> topspin

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
your wrist because that adds topspin

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.789 
your wrist because that adds topspin

power whatever well that's not the case
your<00:00:14.580> wrist<00:00:14.910> should<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.420> passive<00:00:15.990> when<00:00:16.109> you

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
your wrist should be passive when you

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
your wrist should be passive when you

hit a forehand in other words once you

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.240 
hit a forehand in other words once you
set<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:18.660> your<00:00:18.779> hitting<00:00:18.960> arm<00:00:19.199> position<00:00:19.680> which

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
set into your hitting arm position which

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
set into your hitting arm position which
we<00:00:20.400> discussed<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.270> separate<00:00:21.660> video<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.080> this

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
we discussed in a separate video in this

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.730 
we discussed in a separate video in this
section<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.460> wrist<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.029> more<00:00:24.840> generally<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
section the wrist and more generally the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.109 
section the wrist and more generally the
rest<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.099> your<00:00:26.189> arm<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.640> your<00:00:26.730> racket<00:00:26.939> that

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
rest of your arm and your racket that

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
rest of your arm and your racket that
relationship<00:00:27.840> shouldn't<00:00:28.830> change<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.400> it's

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
relationship shouldn't change so it's

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.830 
relationship shouldn't change so it's
going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> stay<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> same<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.539> swing<00:00:30.720> up

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
going to stay the same as you swing up

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.819 
going to stay the same as you swing up
to<00:00:30.869> contact<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:32.880> follow-through

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
to contact and in to your follow-through

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
to contact and in to your follow-through
now<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.250> illustrate<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> point<00:00:36.059> we're<00:00:36.809> going

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
now to illustrate this point we're going

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.680 
now to illustrate this point we're going
to<00:00:36.989> look<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.649> Frank<00:00:38.309> Salazar<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> fyb<00:00:39.239> TV

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to look at Frank Salazar on the fyb TV

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.170 
to look at Frank Salazar on the fyb TV
screen<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.250> once<00:00:41.250> he<00:00:41.370> sets<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.940> hitting

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
screen and once he sets into was hitting

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.670 
screen and once he sets into was hitting
our<00:00:42.300> position<00:00:42.719> which<00:00:42.930> he's<00:00:43.079> done<00:00:43.230> right<00:00:43.469> here

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
our position which he's done right here

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
our position which he's done right here
his<00:00:44.370> wrist<00:00:44.670> position<00:00:45.000> isn't<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> change

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
his wrist position isn't going to change

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.319 
his wrist position isn't going to change
so<00:00:46.230> he<00:00:46.320> swings<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.770> he<00:00:47.129> hits<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.149> freeze

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so he swings up he hits and if we freeze

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
so he swings up he hits and if we freeze
it<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.660> his<00:00:48.780> follow-through<00:00:49.110> wrist<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it here and his follow-through wrist is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.680 
it here and his follow-through wrist is
still<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> same<00:00:51.180> position<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
still in the same position the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.910 
still in the same position the
relationship<00:00:52.170> between<00:00:52.260> his<00:00:52.469> wrist<00:00:52.680> arm

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
relationship between his wrist arm

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360 
relationship between his wrist arm
racket<00:00:53.820> hasn't<00:00:54.449> changed<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.800> release<00:00:56.160> if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
racket hasn't changed it will release if

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
racket hasn't changed it will release if
we<00:00:56.610> continue<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> play<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.899> follows

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
we continue to play this as he follows

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
we continue to play this as he follows
through<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.739> again<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.129> well<00:00:59.910> after<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
through but again that's well after the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.869 
through but again that's well after the
ball<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.079> office<00:01:01.410> strings

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
ball is office strings

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.640 
ball is office strings
for<00:01:02.879> comparison's<00:01:03.510> sake<00:01:03.690> let's<00:01:04.350> look<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
for comparison's sake let's look at a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
for comparison's sake let's look at a
windshield<00:01:04.979> wiper<00:01:05.189> forehand<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.180> Oliver

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
windshield wiper forehand this is Oliver

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.260 
windshield wiper forehand this is Oliver
actually<00:01:07.020> hitting<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.320> windshield<00:01:07.439> wiper<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
actually hitting a windshield wiper and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.429 
actually hitting a windshield wiper and
once<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.479> sets<00:01:09.750> into<00:01:09.960> his<00:01:10.080> hitting<00:01:10.229> arm

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
once he sets into his hitting arm

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
once he sets into his hitting arm
position<00:01:10.890> he's<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> swing<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.210> make

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
position he's going to swing up make

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
position he's going to swing up make
contact<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.130> freeze<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> into

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
contact and then if we freeze it into

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.350 
contact and then if we freeze it into
his<00:01:15.330> follow-through<00:01:15.720> wrist<00:01:16.680> forearm<00:01:17.610> racket

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
his follow-through wrist forearm racket

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
all still in the same relationship so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.020 
all still in the same relationship so
again<00:01:20.820> his<00:01:21.270> wrist<00:01:21.720> hasn't<00:01:22.650> changed<00:01:23.549> he<00:01:23.700> hasn't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
again his wrist hasn't changed he hasn't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.789 
again his wrist hasn't changed he hasn't
used<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> slap<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> ball<00:01:25.049> whatever<00:01:25.590> the

want to make is that there's a
difference<00:01:40.680> between<00:01:40.850> what<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.030> wrist<00:01:42.299> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
difference between what your wrist is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.319 
difference between what your wrist is
doing<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.049> pronation<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.149> hit<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
doing and pronation when you hit a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
doing and pronation when you hit a
forehand<00:01:45.680> somebody<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.860> Federer<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.490> Nadal

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
forehand somebody like Federer or Nadal

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
forehand somebody like Federer or Nadal
we'll<00:01:48.450> pronate<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.320> add<00:01:49.470> topspin<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> their

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
we'll pronate to add topspin to their

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.840 
we'll pronate to add topspin to their
forehand<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.659> pronation<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:53.250> forearm

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
forehand but pronation is your forearm

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
forehand but pronation is your forearm
and<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.180> wrists<00:01:54.960> turning<00:01:55.710> over<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> piece

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and your wrists turning over as a piece

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.630 
and your wrists turning over as a piece
so<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.299> different<00:01:58.049> than<00:01:58.500> using<00:01:58.799> your

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
so that's different than using your

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.459 
so that's different than using your
wrist<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> hit<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> forehand<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.380> an

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
wrist when you hit a forehand that's an

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.139 
wrist when you hit a forehand that's an
important<00:02:01.950> concept<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> understand<00:02:02.939> because

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
important concept to understand because

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
important concept to understand because
when<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> watch<00:02:04.170> Federer's<00:02:04.649> forehand<00:02:05.070> or

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
when you watch Federer's forehand or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.700 
when you watch Federer's forehand or
Nadal's<00:02:05.640> forehand<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.299> full<00:02:06.600> speed<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.469> shot

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
Nadal's forehand at full speed the shot

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.160 
Nadal's forehand at full speed the shot
can<00:02:07.860> look<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.160> whippy<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.750> easy<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
can look pretty whippy so it's easy to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.360 
can look pretty whippy so it's easy to
understand<00:02:10.619> why<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.190> some

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
understand why there's some

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
understand why there's some
misconception<00:02:12.180> about<00:02:12.270> what's<00:02:12.690> going<00:02:12.989> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
misconception about what's going on

exactly
with<00:02:14.159> your<00:02:14.310> wrist<00:02:14.549> when<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.120> hit<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> forehand

but again just to reiterate wrist is

you hit a forehand is probably something

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
you do not want to try to do unless you

something you should be focusing on

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
freeze it at contact he has not pronated

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.319 
freeze it at contact he has not pronated
now<00:03:04.040> Oliver<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.549> former<00:03:05.909> number<00:03:06.120> one

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
now Oliver is the former number one

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.690 
now Oliver is the former number one
player<00:03:06.599> from<00:03:06.780> Togo<00:03:07.049> his<00:03:07.650> forehand<00:03:08.099> II<00:03:08.280> hit<00:03:08.489> he

absolutely<00:03:09.420> destroyed<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.109> fed<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.739> ball<00:03:10.889> I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
absolutely destroyed I fed the ball I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.289 
absolutely destroyed I fed the ball I
had<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.220> duck<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.579> get<00:03:11.700> out<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.909> the<00:03:11.970> way<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.239> was

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
had to duck to get out of the way it was

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.330 
had to duck to get out of the way it was
ridiculous<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.079> if<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.010> want<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.220> hit<00:03:14.310> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
ridiculous so if you want to hit a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.940 
ridiculous so if you want to hit a
forehand<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.939> Oliver<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.109> do<00:03:16.319> not<00:03:16.470> need<00:03:16.769> to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
forehand like Oliver you do not need to

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.460 
forehand like Oliver you do not need to
pronate<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.549> again<00:03:18.329> there<00:03:18.900> are<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.139> million

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
pronate and again there are a million

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
pronate and again there are a million
other<00:03:19.680> things<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.250> should<00:03:20.280> be<00:03:20.459> working<00:03:20.790> on<00:03:21.030> as

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
other things you should be working on as

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.240 
other things you should be working on as
you<00:03:21.269> build<00:03:21.510> your<00:03:21.599> forehand<00:03:22.049> up<00:03:22.319> it's<00:03:22.919> good<00:03:23.160> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
you build your forehand up it's good to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.309 
you build your forehand up it's good to
know<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.699> pronation<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.480> possibility<00:03:25.199> but

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
know that pronation is a possibility but
