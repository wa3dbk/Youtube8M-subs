to go in from a different angle here I
like<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> design<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:26.340> would<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.849> cool<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.359> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
like to design it would be cool if it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.030 
like to design it would be cool if it
was<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> real<00:00:28.380> design<00:00:29.269> however<00:00:30.949> there's<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
was the real design however there's a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.270 
was the real design however there's a
company<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.700> there<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:34.110> made<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> case<00:00:34.620> for

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280

easy and they had a case that they
brought<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.739> i<00:00:52.789> may<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:53.820> may<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.120> have

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
feeling of what people think of the case

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.010 
feeling of what people think of the case
and<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.739> similar<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.020> next

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and that it would be similar to the next

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.109 
and that it would be similar to the next
possible<00:01:07.619> iphone<00:01:08.479> am<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.570> talking<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
possible iphone am I talking about the

switch easy rebel square design flat

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.990 
switch easy rebel square design flat
just<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.850> phone<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.600> saw

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
just like the phone that we just saw

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
just like the phone that we just saw
whether<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.270> real<00:01:25.040> obvious<00:01:26.040> ly<00:01:26.280> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
whether this is real obvious ly this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
whether this is real obvious ly this
Israel<00:01:26.820> whether<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> design<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.380> not

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
Israel whether that's the design or not

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.980 
Israel whether that's the design or not
I<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.520> cool<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.990> I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I just think it's really cool that I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.240 
I just think it's really cool that I
heard<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.520> through<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> grapevine<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
heard this through the grapevine that

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
heard this through the grapevine that
this<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.610> their<00:01:36.180> idea<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.380> wanted

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this was their idea of what they wanted

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.999 
this was their idea of what they wanted
to<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> next<00:01:38.310> iPhone<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.950> lo<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
to do for the next iPhone and lo and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.260 
to do for the next iPhone and lo and
behold<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.180> come<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.979> so

behold we see this thing come out so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.440 
behold we see this thing come out so
from<00:01:45.560> putting<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.710> case<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.450> whether

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
from putting a case out whether

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
real whatever the case may be i just

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.689 
real whatever the case may be i just
think<00:06:28.360> its<00:06:28.449> slimy<00:06:28.990> that<00:06:29.320> you<00:06:29.530> got<00:06:30.220> this<00:06:30.430> if<00:06:30.610> it

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
think its slimy that you got this if it

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.700 
think its slimy that you got this if it
is<00:06:30.849> real<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:31.659> know<00:06:31.780> like<00:06:31.900> i<00:06:31.990> said<00:06:32.199> it's<00:06:32.530> all

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
is real you know like i said it's all

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.800 
is real you know like i said it's all
speculation<00:06:32.979> is<00:06:33.520> real<00:06:33.760> isn't<00:06:34.000> whatever<00:06:34.570> I

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
speculation is real isn't whatever I

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.860 
speculation is real isn't whatever I
just<00:06:35.380> think<00:06:35.560> it's<00:06:35.710> if<00:06:36.159> they<00:06:36.639> did<00:06:36.909> this<00:06:37.150> with

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
just think it's if they did this with

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.629 
just think it's if they did this with
the<00:06:37.990> intention<00:06:38.500> to<00:06:38.620> say<00:06:38.800> Luke<00:06:39.279> will<00:06:39.400> we<00:06:39.490> got

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
the intention to say Luke will we got

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.020 
the intention to say Luke will we got
huh

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
huh

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.990 
huh
then<00:06:40.810> you're<00:06:40.960> slime<00:06:41.290> if<00:06:41.680> you're<00:06:42.400> part<00:06:42.640> of<00:06:42.730> some

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
then you're slime if you're part of some

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.090 
then you're slime if you're part of some
elaborate<00:06:43.450> plan<00:06:43.840> or<00:06:44.320> whatever<00:06:44.620> which<00:06:44.860> I

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
elaborate plan or whatever which I

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.790 
elaborate plan or whatever which I
highly<00:06:45.700> doubt<00:06:46.090> that<00:06:46.150> apple<00:06:46.750> would<00:06:46.870> even<00:06:47.350> begin

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
highly doubt that apple would even begin

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.620 
highly doubt that apple would even begin
to<00:06:47.920> do<00:06:48.040> that<00:06:48.190> they<00:06:48.310> don't<00:06:48.460> need<00:06:48.550> to<00:06:48.910> do<00:06:49.060> it<00:06:49.210> they

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
to do that they don't need to do it they

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.450 
to do that they don't need to do it they
don't<00:06:49.750> need<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.320> create<00:06:50.590> more<00:06:50.950> press<00:06:51.250> they

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
don't need to create more press they
