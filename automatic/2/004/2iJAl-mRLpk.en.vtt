00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Are you having difficulties with 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.620
 women 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.620
 Good morning to the seven pieces your papacy 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.719
 you are dissatisfied with the amount 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.850
 of hairs on your face 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.820
 I am dissatisfied with the amount of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 light on my face and I'm 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.560
 feeling the pressure of colleagues from 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 Work can not be light man. 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.230
 because you did not have a mustache like everyone else 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230
 we 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 I look pest style if you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.840
 answered yes to one or none of these 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 questions and you may be interested 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.539
 not like the border of congratulations campaign is 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.570
 only heat the beard gel for three 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.149
 minutes and if you deliver the cane you can 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.399
 feel a mild burning in the face but 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 do not worry any burn of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.930
 third grade will be invisible 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.930
 nothing but then drink two to four 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.390
 liters of syrup after the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 syrup and you will notice the beard in 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.119
 minutes 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.780
 I can hardly perceive the pain because 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.630
 I am so happy and the best beats here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.090
 beard is permanent of you no more 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.460
 will have a smooth ugly face like before 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.409
 our formula created by the beard 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.640
 extra options that can not be 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:28.979
 removed in something different you 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.650
 You cut the hair, right? 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.890
 It's good, it's a little fat but it was not 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.890
 only that 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.890
 I already know now you have a beard but it is not 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.100
 any beard is an instantaneous bomb 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.760

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.790
