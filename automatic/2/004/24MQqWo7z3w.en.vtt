00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.180 
for all mountain riding you're going to
find<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.040> great<00:02:23.959> torsional<00:02:24.959> stiffness<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
find a great torsional stiffness on the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.630 
find a great torsional stiffness on the
Fox<00:02:26.880> front<00:02:27.269> fork<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.900> also<00:02:28.769> with<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.100> chassis

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
Fox front fork and also with the chassis

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.729 
Fox front fork and also with the chassis
the<00:02:29.880> frames<00:02:30.150> rear<00:02:30.480> ends<00:02:30.739> extremely

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the frames rear ends extremely

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.570 
the frames rear ends extremely
torsionally<00:02:32.340> stiff<00:02:32.720> now<00:02:33.720> we've<00:02:33.900> also

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
torsionally stiff now we've also

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
torsionally stiff now we've also
achieved<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.880> stiffness<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> frame<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
achieved the stiffness of the frame so

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.650 
achieved the stiffness of the frame so
that<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.830> overly<00:02:38.310> stiff<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
that is not overly stiff but that it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.830 
that is not overly stiff but that it
will<00:02:40.100> ride<00:02:41.100> into<00:02:41.340> corners<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.150> release

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
will ride into corners and release

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.880 
will ride into corners and release
energy<00:02:43.079> where<00:02:44.070> appropriate<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:45.260> flex<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
energy where appropriate and flex to the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.949 
energy where appropriate and flex to the
degree<00:02:47.040> necessary<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:48.000> definitely<00:02:48.630> we<00:02:48.750> err

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
degree necessary but definitely we err

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.060 
degree necessary but definitely we err
on<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> side<00:02:49.610> being<00:02:50.610> stiffer<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
on the side being stiffer then then you

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.460 
on the side being stiffer then then you
know<00:02:53.190> having<00:02:53.549> unwanted<00:02:53.880> flux<00:02:54.360> now<00:02:55.079> that's<00:02:55.380> a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
know having unwanted flux now that's a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.220 
know having unwanted flux now that's a
new<00:02:55.620> gamut<00:02:56.130> chain<00:02:56.489> guide<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.600> dual<00:02:57.840> ring

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
new gamut chain guide it's a dual ring

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.030 
new gamut chain guide it's a dual ring
system<00:02:59.060> gammy<00:03:00.060> makes<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.630> very<00:03:01.170> nice<00:03:01.440> product

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
system gammy makes a very nice product

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.830 
system gammy makes a very nice product
and<00:03:02.280> we've<00:03:02.850> inspected<00:03:03.269> some<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.750> their

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
and we've inspected some of their

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.420 
and we've inspected some of their
products<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.440> our<00:03:04.470> bikes<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:04.980> here<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
products on our bikes this here with a

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.500 
products on our bikes this here with a
lot<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.700> success<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.730> frame<00:03:09.180> is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
lot of success and so this frame is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.770 
lot of success and so this frame is
available<00:03:10.230> now<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:12.359> just<00:03:12.540> need<00:03:12.690> to

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
available now and you just need to

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.990 
available now and you just need to
specify<00:03:13.109> that<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.769> want<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.280> limited

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
specify that you want the limited

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.870 
specify that you want the limited
edition<00:03:16.160> xco<00:03:17.720> thank<00:03:18.720> you
