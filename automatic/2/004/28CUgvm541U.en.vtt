00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
through the cheesecake and that allows

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
through the cheesecake and that allows
me<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> run<00:01:15.240> through<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
different places that I need to be if

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.410 
different places that I need to be if
you<00:01:19.290> mess<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.799> cutting<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> cheesecake<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you mess up cutting the cheesecake you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
you mess up cutting the cheesecake you
may<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.840> been<00:01:21.960> able<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> tell<00:01:22.439> by<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
may have been able to tell by now but it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
may have been able to tell by now but it
grows<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.299> messing<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.290> really

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
grows back so messing up is not really

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
grows back so messing up is not really
that<00:01:25.650> big<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.250> deal<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> some

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that big of a deal but there are some

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
that big of a deal but there are some
cases<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> want<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.159> careful

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
cases that you want to be really careful

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.480 
cases that you want to be really careful
because<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.400> were

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
because it like right here if you were

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
because it like right here if you were
to<00:01:32.610> cut<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> top<00:01:33.600> part<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> cheesecake

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to cut the top part of that cheesecake

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.679 
to cut the top part of that cheesecake
then<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> would<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.340> smashed<00:01:35.700> those<00:01:36.180> extra

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
then it would have smashed those extra

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.600 
then it would have smashed those extra
lumps<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> cut<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
lumps and right here if you cut all of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
lumps and right here if you cut all of
it<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.060> those<00:01:39.180> lumps<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.930> roll

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it then those lumps would just roll

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380 
it then those lumps would just roll
right<00:01:40.650> off<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.009> cheesecake<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.210> their

this level to get the golden trophy by
the<00:01:47.970> end<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:49.079> want<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> try<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> save

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the end you really want to try to save

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.340 
the end you really want to try to save
as<00:01:50.369> many<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.240> along<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
as many as you can along with the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.690 
as many as you can along with the
regular<00:01:53.220> 10<00:01:53.520> teensies<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.390> are<00:01:54.600> required

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
regular 10 teensies that are required

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.959 
regular 10 teensies that are required
anyway<00:01:57.649> right<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.189> another<00:01:59.490> case<00:01:59.700> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
anyway right here is another case that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.090 
anyway right here is another case that
you<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> cut<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> cheesecake

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
you don't want to cut the cheesecake

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
you don't want to cut the cheesecake
incorrectly<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.060> if<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> were<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.630> cut

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
incorrectly because if you were to cut

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
incorrectly because if you were to cut
the<00:02:04.079> bottom<00:02:04.409> part<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.100> team's<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.820> would

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the bottom part the team's you would

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.029 
the bottom part the team's you would
have<00:02:06.119> fell<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.509> his<00:02:06.630> death<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.860> for

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
have fell to his death and that's for

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
have fell to his death and that's for
this<00:02:08.160> part<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> matter<00:02:09.539> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this part it's really just a matter of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
this part it's really just a matter of
learning<00:02:10.440> well<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.280> matter<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
learning well it's just a matter of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.420 
learning well it's just a matter of
because<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> cut<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.709> really<00:02:13.980> low<00:02:14.130> part

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
because if you cut the really low part

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130 
because if you cut the really low part
you'd<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> jump<00:02:15.000> over<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> spike<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:16.020> if

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you'd have to jump over the spike but if

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.790 
you'd have to jump over the spike but if
you<00:02:16.230> Cove<00:02:16.440> cut<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.550> top<00:02:17.970> part<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:19.200> only<00:02:19.500> have

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
you Cove cut the top part you only have

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.840 
you Cove cut the top part you only have
to<00:02:20.810> walk<00:02:21.810> right<00:02:22.290> across<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.459> course<00:02:23.700> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
to walk right across and of course you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.660 
to walk right across and of course you
will<00:02:24.000> want<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.209> wait<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.900> Cheesecake<00:02:25.350> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
will want to wait for the Cheesecake to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.520 
will want to wait for the Cheesecake to
spawn<00:02:26.670> back<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.110> make<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.380> up<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
spawn back just so you can make it up to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.729 
spawn back just so you can make it up to
the<00:02:28.770> first<00:02:29.040> royalty<00:02:29.640> teensie<00:02:30.380> for<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.500> one

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the first royalty teensie for this one

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.120 
the first royalty teensie for this one
is<00:02:32.250> well<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> your<00:02:33.270> first<00:02:34.130> encounter

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
is well this is your first encounter

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.430 
is well this is your first encounter
with<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.489> weird<00:02:35.819> lava<00:02:36.360> type<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.900> stuff<00:02:37.140> which

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
with this weird lava type of stuff which

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.910 
with this weird lava type of stuff which
is<00:02:37.830> eerily<00:02:38.520> similar<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.300> gel<00:02:39.900> from<00:02:40.260> portal

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
is eerily similar to the gel from portal

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.640 
is eerily similar to the gel from portal
2<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:42.239> mean<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.510> know<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.840> not<00:02:42.989> actually

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
2 and I mean I know it's not actually

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.860 
2 and I mean I know it's not actually
from<00:02:44.160> portal<00:02:44.700> 2<00:02:44.850> but<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.180> does<00:02:45.330> look<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.720> lot

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
from portal 2 but it does look a lot

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
from portal 2 but it does look a lot
like<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> especially<00:02:46.980> later<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.880> game

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
like it and especially later in the game

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.509 
like it and especially later in the game
when<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.390> start<00:02:48.690> running<00:02:48.989> into<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.380> more<00:02:49.590> if

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
when you start running into it more if

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.130 
when you start running into it more if
you've<00:02:50.730> played<00:02:50.880> portal<00:02:51.330> 2<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.690> will<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.989> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you've played portal 2 you will see the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.500 
you've played portal 2 you will see the
two<00:02:52.320> kind<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.890> they<00:02:53.340> seem<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.910> move<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.269> same

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
two kind of they seem to move the same

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.210 
two kind of they seem to move the same
they're<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.780> similar<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.890> was<00:02:55.980> just

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
they're just similar and it was just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.130 
they're just similar and it was just
what<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:57.000> know<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.269> reminded<00:02:57.959> me<00:02:58.110> of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
what you know it just reminded me of

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.000 
what you know it just reminded me of
portal<00:02:58.860> 2<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.870> being<00:03:01.080> said<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.739> not

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
portal 2 but that being said it is not

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.100 
portal 2 but that being said it is not
helpful<00:03:02.550> like<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.239> important<00:03:03.720> -<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
helpful like it is important - it is

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.280 
helpful like it is important - it is
very<00:03:04.470> annoying<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.819> will<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.390> extremely

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
very annoying and it will be extremely

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.590 
very annoying and it will be extremely
inconvenient<00:03:07.739> sometimes<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.269> even

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
inconvenient sometimes and there is even

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600 
inconvenient sometimes and there is even
one<00:03:09.630> part<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.470> level<00:03:10.739> where<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
one part in this level where it's a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.199 
one part in this level where it's a
little<00:03:11.730> bit<00:03:11.880> annoying<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:14.280> its<00:03:14.610> own<00:03:14.819> and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
little bit annoying on its own and

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.850 
little bit annoying on its own and
you'll<00:03:15.630> see<00:03:15.810> what<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:15.989> mean<00:03:16.170> when<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.620> there

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
you'll see what I mean when I get there

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.690 
you'll see what I mean when I get there
so<00:03:17.690> for<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.840> place<00:03:19.170> once<00:03:20.010> again<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.400> do<00:03:20.519> want

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
so for this place once again you do want

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.699 
so for this place once again you do want
to<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:20.850> as<00:03:20.970> many<00:03:21.120> lumps<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.530> I

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
to get as many lumps as you can and I

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.460 
to get as many lumps as you can and I
cut<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> Cheesecake<00:03:23.670> wrong<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:25.170> those

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
cut the Cheesecake wrong there and those

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.160 
cut the Cheesecake wrong there and those
lumps<00:03:25.769> rolled<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.640> their<00:03:26.790> death<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.900> want

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
lumps rolled to their death so you want

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.140 
lumps rolled to their death so you want
to<00:03:28.350> avoid<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:32.130> lumps<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.760> top

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
to avoid that but the lumps on the top

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.630 
to avoid that but the lumps on the top
here<00:03:33.660> like<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.620> see<00:03:34.799> there's<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> blue<00:03:35.430> Lum

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
here like you see there's the blue Lum

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.400 
here like you see there's the blue Lum
and<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.150> course<00:03:36.360> if<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.630> get<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> blue<00:03:37.170> lumps

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
and of course if you get the blue lumps

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.470 
and of course if you get the blue lumps
first<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.190> chain<00:03:38.459> then<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:38.970> get<00:03:39.120> double

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
first and the chain then you get double

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.210 
first and the chain then you get double
lumps<00:03:39.690> for<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.170> remainder<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.769> chain

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
lumps for the remainder of that chain

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.030 
lumps for the remainder of that chain
unless<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.790> break<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.109> these<00:03:43.320> blue

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
unless you break it so to get these blue

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680 
unless you break it so to get these blue
lumps<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.459> are<00:03:44.579> higher<00:03:44.820> up<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.299> need<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> get

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
lumps that are higher up you need to get

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.630 
lumps that are higher up you need to get
on<00:03:45.900> top<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.380> cheesecake<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:49.040> jump<00:03:50.040> from

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
on top of the cheesecake and jump from

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.479 
on top of the cheesecake and jump from
the<00:03:50.970> top<00:03:51.150> down<00:03:51.600> now<00:03:52.230> for<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> reset<00:03:53.370> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
the top down now for here I reset the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.840 
the top down now for here I reset the
sequence<00:03:53.880> because<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.299> wanted<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.930> go<00:03:55.049> back<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
sequence because I wanted to go back and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
sequence because I wanted to go back and
try<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:56.880> get<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.239> chain<00:03:57.660> that<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.930> broke<00:03:58.290> but

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
try and get that chain that I broke but

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.979 
try and get that chain that I broke but
as<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.070> see<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.579> can't<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.269> go<00:04:00.510> backwards

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
as you see I can't really go backwards

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.420 
as you see I can't really go backwards
and<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.260> thought<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.590> know<00:04:01.620> what<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.980> doesn't

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
and I thought you know what it doesn't

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.520 
and I thought you know what it doesn't
really<00:04:02.519> matter<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.239> then<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.989> died<00:04:04.049> because

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
really matter and then I died because

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490 
really matter and then I died because
playing<00:04:05.160> as<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> duck<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.970> pretty<00:04:06.870> weird<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.470> mean

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
playing as a duck is pretty weird I mean

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.699 
playing as a duck is pretty weird I mean
it's<00:04:07.829> not<00:04:08.060> it's<00:04:09.060> not<00:04:09.329> really<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.709> hindering

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
it's not it's not really that hindering

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.860 
it's not it's not really that hindering
playing<00:04:11.100> as<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> duck<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.850> guess<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.480> one<00:04:12.660> way<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
playing as a duck I guess is one way to

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.279 
playing as a duck I guess is one way to
put<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.170> but<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:13.940> strange<00:04:14.940> because<00:04:15.299> you

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
put it but it's strange because you

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.620 
put it but it's strange because you
can't<00:04:16.890> really<00:04:17.190> jump<00:04:17.549> as<00:04:17.729> far<00:04:17.760> as<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.419> can

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
can't really jump as far as you can

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.240 
can't really jump as far as you can
normally<00:04:19.049> because<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.470> are<00:04:19.620> physically<00:04:20.190> a

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
normally because you are physically a

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.540 
normally because you are physically a
smaller<00:04:21.289> character<00:04:22.289> than<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.680> are<00:04:23.039> when<00:04:23.400> you

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
smaller character than you are when you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.050 
smaller character than you are when you
are<00:04:23.580> not<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> duck<00:04:24.240> and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
are not a duck and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.780 
are not a duck and
you<00:04:25.090> also<00:04:25.210> can't<00:04:25.690> really<00:04:26.169> boost<00:04:26.980> yourself<00:04:27.520> as

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
you also can't really boost yourself as

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.350 
you also can't really boost yourself as
far<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.830> don't<00:04:30.280> know<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.580> playing<00:04:31.000> as<00:04:31.330> a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
far so it's I don't know it playing as a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.510 
far so it's I don't know it playing as a
duck<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.900> different<00:04:32.500> but<00:04:32.830> it's<00:04:32.980> not<00:04:33.130> too

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
duck is different but it's not too

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.310 
duck is different but it's not too
different<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.210> that's<00:04:34.690> really<00:04:34.870> something

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
different and that's really something

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.620 
different and that's really something
that's<00:04:35.350> hard<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:35.770> explain<00:04:36.130> in<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.669> video<00:04:36.970> that's

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
that's hard to explain in a video that's

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.700 
that's hard to explain in a video that's
really<00:04:37.720> something<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.380> would<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.560> to

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
really something you would have to

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.800 
really something you would have to
experience<00:04:39.430> it's<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:39.970> trying<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.389> explain

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
experience it's like trying to explain

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.810 
experience it's like trying to explain
why<00:04:41.500> controls<00:04:42.190> are<00:04:42.400> bad<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.180> to

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
why controls are bad you just have to

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.730 
why controls are bad you just have to
you<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:45.850> have<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.300> play<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.840> game<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.410> know<00:04:47.530> why

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
you just have to play a game to know why

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.010 
you just have to play a game to know why
the<00:04:47.800> controls<00:04:48.280> are<00:04:48.550> bad<00:04:48.820> now<00:04:49.510> I'm<00:04:49.690> not<00:04:49.810> saying

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
the controls are bad now I'm not saying

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.540 
the controls are bad now I'm not saying
they're<00:04:50.200> bad<00:04:50.230> in<00:04:50.680> Rain<00:04:50.919> Man<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:51.160> think<00:04:51.430> they're

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
they're bad in Rain Man I think they're

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.370 
they're bad in Rain Man I think they're
really<00:04:51.790> good<00:04:52.030> in<00:04:52.060> Rain<00:04:52.389> Man<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.020> just<00:04:53.169> mean

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
really good in Rain Man but I just mean

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.320 
really good in Rain Man but I just mean
that<00:04:53.530> same<00:04:53.710> kind<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.130> concept<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:54.910> playing

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
that same kind of concept that playing

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.510 
that same kind of concept that playing
as<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.510> duck<00:04:55.810> is<00:04:56.169> different<00:04:57.070> but<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.250> can't

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
as a duck is different but I can't

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.040 
as a duck is different but I can't
really<00:04:57.639> explain<00:04:57.790> why<00:04:58.240> it's<00:04:58.419> different

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
really explain why it's different

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.530 
really explain why it's different
so<00:04:59.530> anyway<00:04:59.770> moving<00:04:59.950> on<00:05:00.220> from<00:05:00.430> this<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:01.389> you

you can now not all of this lava is
deadly<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.450> if<00:06:01.840> you<00:06:02.200> could<00:06:02.380> see<00:06:02.590> some<00:06:02.950> of<00:06:02.979> it

starts to fade that part probably won't

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.670 
starts to fade that part probably won't
kill<00:06:05.800> you<00:06:05.979> but<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.150> is<00:06:07.270> best<00:06:07.479> to<00:06:07.690> not<00:06:08.169> take<00:06:08.440> as

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
kill you but it is best to not take as

kill you but it is best to not take as
many<00:06:08.919> chances<00:06:09.280> as<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:11.320> can<00:06:11.710> just<00:06:12.280> because

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
many chances as you can just because

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.969 
many chances as you can just because

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
Wii U you have a lot more control than

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.450 
Wii U you have a lot more control than
if<00:06:39.220> you<00:06:39.310> have<00:06:39.490> this<00:06:40.290> stupid<00:06:41.290> Firefly<00:06:42.010> guy<00:06:42.250> like

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
if you have this stupid Firefly guy like

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.580 
if you have this stupid Firefly guy like
for<00:06:42.700> me<00:06:42.820> I<00:06:43.090> cut<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.930> cheese<00:06:44.230> kick<00:06:44.410> right

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590

for me I cut that cheese kick right
there<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:44.890> then<00:06:45.010> you<00:06:45.070> went<00:06:45.190> straight<00:06:45.520> back<00:06:45.700> to

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
there and then you went straight back to

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.030 
there and then you went straight back to
the<00:06:46.060> other<00:06:46.810> cheese<00:06:47.200> cake<00:06:47.470> and<00:06:47.680> I<00:06:47.740> was<00:06:47.890> like

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
the other cheese cake and I was like

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.490 
the other cheese cake and I was like
what<00:06:48.280> why<00:06:48.430> would<00:06:48.730> you<00:06:48.850> do<00:06:48.970> that<00:06:49.000> for

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
what why would you do that for

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.220 
what why would you do that for
for<00:06:50.500> this<00:06:51.150> golden<00:06:52.150> coin<00:06:52.360> it's<00:06:52.660> a<00:06:52.750> little<00:06:53.110> bit

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
for this golden coin it's a little bit

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.320 
for this golden coin it's a little bit
tricky<00:06:53.590> just<00:06:53.620> go<00:06:54.010> really<00:06:54.310> slowly<00:06:54.610> and<00:06:54.940> then<00:06:55.060> he

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
tricky just go really slowly and then he

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.930 
tricky just go really slowly and then he
will<00:06:55.510> hopefully<00:06:56.050> warp<00:06:56.620> over<00:06:56.800> there<00:06:57.460> are<00:06:57.610> some

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
will hopefully warp over there are some

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.940 
will hopefully warp over there are some
times<00:06:58.210> especially<00:06:58.900> later<00:06:59.140> in<00:06:59.230> the<00:06:59.350> game<00:06:59.560> for

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
times especially later in the game for

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.920 
times especially later in the game for
me<00:07:00.100> when<00:07:00.430> this<00:07:00.640> guy<00:07:00.850> would<00:07:01.150> not<00:07:01.450> do<00:07:01.720> what<00:07:01.900> I

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
me when this guy would not do what I

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.930 
me when this guy would not do what I
wanted<00:07:02.290> him<00:07:02.470> to<00:07:02.530> do<00:07:02.770> and<00:07:02.800> that<00:07:03.100> was<00:07:03.280> just

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
wanted him to do and that was just

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.410 
wanted him to do and that was just
really<00:07:04.600> annoying<00:07:05.290> so<00:07:06.040> here<00:07:06.430> is<00:07:06.610> a<00:07:06.640> runner<00:07:07.060> part

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
really annoying so here is a runner part

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.590 
really annoying so here is a runner part
and<00:07:07.720> as<00:07:07.990> with<00:07:08.200> all<00:07:08.380> running<00:07:09.390> sections<00:07:10.390> in

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
and as with all running sections in

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.510 
and as with all running sections in
Rayman<00:07:11.200> it's<00:07:11.530> really<00:07:11.950> just<00:07:12.070> a<00:07:12.220> matter<00:07:12.370> of

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
Rayman it's really just a matter of

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.110 
Rayman it's really just a matter of
practice<00:07:12.970> learning<00:07:13.870> the<00:07:14.020> level<00:07:14.350> and<00:07:14.940> once<00:07:15.940> you

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
practice learning the level and once you
