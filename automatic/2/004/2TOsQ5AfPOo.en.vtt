my gloves and you can see as I getting
closer<00:02:55.940> another<00:02:56.940> glancing<00:02:57.420> blow<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.900> hit<00:02:58.410> him

closer another glancing blow I hit him
once<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> body<00:02:59.010> hijabs<00:03:00.200> when<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> get<00:03:01.380> right

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
once in the body hijabs when I get right

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.620 
once in the body hijabs when I get right
to<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.650> knockout<00:03:01.980> moment<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.550> mean<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.570> is

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
to the knockout moment I mean this is

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.970 
to the knockout moment I mean this is
probably<00:03:03.990> gonna<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.260> really<00:03:04.410> brilliant<00:03:04.860> from

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
probably gonna be really brilliant from

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.630 
probably gonna be really brilliant from
the<00:03:05.070> other<00:03:05.220> side<00:03:07.010> why<00:03:08.010> we're<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:08.280> our<00:03:08.430> way<00:03:08.489> to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the other side why we're on our way to

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.160 
the other side why we're on our way to
show<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.120> nut<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.510> punch<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.840> another

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
show you this nut this punch is another

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.810 
show you this nut this punch is another
thing<00:03:10.260> about<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> physics<00:03:10.830> engine<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.190> all

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
thing about the physics engine is all

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820 
thing about the physics engine is all
the<00:03:12.090> visuals<00:03:12.510> as<00:03:12.720> well<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:13.230> driven<00:03:13.530> from

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the visuals as well are driven from

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.640 
the visuals as well are driven from
physics<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:15.209> can<00:03:15.330> actually<00:03:15.450> see<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:16.110> Tyson

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
physics so you can actually see as Tyson

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.070 
physics so you can actually see as Tyson
throws<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.100> punch<00:03:17.400> his<00:03:18.120> back<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
throws this punch his back because the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.729 
throws this punch his back because the
physics<00:03:19.410> engine<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:19.830> actually<00:03:20.100> flex<00:03:21.739> all

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
physics engine will actually flex all

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.259 
physics engine will actually flex all
the<00:03:23.040> muscle<00:03:23.310> regions<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.730> his<00:03:23.820> backs<00:03:24.060> will

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the muscle regions of his backs will

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.759 
the muscle regions of his backs will
actually<00:03:24.600> flex<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.989> tune<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.380> punches

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
actually flex in tune to the punches

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.310 
actually flex in tune to the punches
that<00:03:25.890> he's<00:03:26.040> throwing<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.640> conversely<00:03:27.390> you'll

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
that he's throwing and conversely you'll

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.830 
that he's throwing and conversely you'll
see<00:03:28.590> Muhammad<00:03:29.519> Ali's<00:03:29.700> face<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.360> rock<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:30.780> a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
see Muhammad Ali's face get rock like a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.330 
see Muhammad Ali's face get rock like a
bunch<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.080> jello<00:03:31.500> here

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.350 

so<00:03:37.340> there<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.519> go<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.969> that's<00:03:38.060> all<00:03:38.329> because

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
so there you go and that's all because

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.149 
so there you go and that's all because

the muscle striations on Ali as he's
getting<00:03:49.129> hit<00:03:49.480> are<00:03:50.480> all<00:03:50.659> because<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.109> game

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
getting hit are all because of the game

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.289 
getting hit are all because of the game
all<00:03:51.799> because<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.189> physics<00:03:52.489> engine<00:03:52.579> she

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
all because of the physics engine she

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.110 
all because of the physics engine she
simply<00:03:53.569> could<00:03:53.810> not

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.399 

do<00:03:56.690> any<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.019> this<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.700> round<00:03:58.700> three<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.409> then

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
do any of this in round three and then

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.229 
do any of this in round three and then
really<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.730> single<00:04:02.150> biggest

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
really that is the single biggest

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.550 
really that is the single biggest
difference<00:04:02.659> between<00:04:02.690> round<00:04:03.080> three<00:04:03.290> around

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
difference between round three around

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.259 
difference between round three around
four<00:04:04.840> if<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:05.959> get<00:04:06.080> back<00:04:06.200> in<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.409> game<00:04:07.269> now

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
four if we get back in the game now

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.369 
four if we get back in the game now
they've<00:04:08.420> talked<00:04:08.629> about<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.900> physics<00:04:09.290> engine

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
they've talked about the physics engine

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.899 
they've talked about the physics engine
another<00:04:09.860> cool<00:04:10.099> thing<00:04:10.159> that<00:04:10.430> physics<00:04:10.700> engine

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
another cool thing that physics engine

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.390 
another cool thing that physics engine
allows<00:04:11.060> us<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.390> do<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.690> allows<00:04:12.560> us<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.980> actually

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
allows us to do is allows us to actually

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.719 
allows us to do is allows us to actually
make<00:04:13.849> height<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.420> reach<00:04:14.870> matter<00:04:15.729> previously

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
going to do against this nothing so

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.189

because he's taller he's faster I have

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:52.660 
because he's taller he's faster I have
to<00:04:45.320> get<00:04:45.500> inside<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:46.220> do<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:49.510> yes

and<00:04:57.320> he's<00:04:57.470> these<00:04:57.920> are<00:04:58.070> all<00:04:58.190> things<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:59.320> as

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
and he's these are all things that as

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.810 
and he's these are all things that as
you<00:05:00.530> look<00:05:00.680> at<00:05:00.770> all<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:00.980> muscles<00:05:01.310> flexing

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
you look at all the muscles flexing

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.160 
you look at all the muscles flexing
everything<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.390> you<00:05:02.480> simply<00:05:02.630> could<00:05:02.900> not<00:05:03.020> do

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
everything that you simply could not do

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.630 
everything that you simply could not do
this<00:05:03.200> in<00:05:03.590> Fight<00:05:03.980> Night<00:05:04.010> I'm<00:05:04.280> free<00:05:04.400> because<00:05:04.580> of

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
this in Fight Night I'm free because of

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.060 
this in Fight Night I'm free because of
the<00:05:04.760> physics<00:05:05.060> engine<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.780> cool<00:05:06.500> thing<00:05:06.710> is<00:05:06.740> it's

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
the physics engine so cool thing is it's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.830 
the physics engine so cool thing is it's
all<00:05:07.190> physics<00:05:07.370> based<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:08.060> milk<00:05:08.420> you<00:05:08.510> like<00:05:08.660> the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
all physics based just milk you like the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.630 
all physics based just milk you like the
number<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.350> punches<00:05:09.710> types<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.220> punches<00:05:10.520> are

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
number of punches types of punches are

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.300 
number of punches types of punches are
just<00:05:10.820> limitless<00:05:11.320> how<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.380> fight<00:05:12.830> now<00:05:13.070> is

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
just limitless how you fight now is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.650 
just limitless how you fight now is
determined<00:05:13.730> by<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:13.850> physics<00:05:14.240> because<00:05:14.390> height

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
determined by the physics because height

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.000 
determined by the physics because height
and<00:05:14.810> reach<00:05:14.900> are<00:05:15.080> actually<00:05:15.380> in<00:05:15.500> place<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:15.920> if

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
and reach are actually in place so if

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.710 
and reach are actually in place so if
you're<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.400> tall<00:05:16.790> gangly<00:05:17.240> guy<00:05:17.390> you're<00:05:17.600> gonna

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
you're a tall gangly guy you're gonna

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.660 
you're a tall gangly guy you're gonna
stay<00:05:17.930> on<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.110> outside<00:05:18.140> if<00:05:18.650> you're<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:19.040> ball<00:05:19.640> of

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
stay on the outside if you're a ball of

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.250 
stay on the outside if you're a ball of
muscle<00:05:20.150> like<00:05:20.390> Mike<00:05:20.600> Tyson<00:05:20.960> you're<00:05:21.080> going<00:05:21.200> to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
muscle like Mike Tyson you're going to

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.750 
muscle like Mike Tyson you're going to
try<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.410> bull<00:05:21.650> your<00:05:21.800> way<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.250> do<00:05:22.400> this<00:05:22.520> so

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
try to bull your way in and do this so

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.600 
try to bull your way in and do this so
Muhammad<00:05:23.120> Ali<00:05:23.650> none<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.770> because<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:25.130> was

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
Muhammad Ali none of that because I was

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.250 
Muhammad Ali none of that because I was
what's<00:05:26.000> possible<00:05:26.330> before<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.870> those<00:05:27.050> are

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
what's possible before and those are

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.230 
what's possible before and those are
really<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.500> single<00:05:27.890> biggest<00:05:28.060> changes<00:05:29.060> we've

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
really the single biggest changes we've

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.790 
really the single biggest changes we've
made<00:05:29.270> I<00:05:29.450> mean<00:05:29.690> we've<00:05:29.780> made<00:05:29.930> many<00:05:30.230> many<00:05:30.350> changes

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800
