 I am in the data for my breath now I am not 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.820
 understood in general how the round started and started 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.149
 write in the general sense is that we 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:36.309

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.170

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.440
 Krasnik for play should we push 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.990
 blue ones are supposed to push and 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.930
 down I am behind the forest and the crowd and I almost 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.240

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.280
