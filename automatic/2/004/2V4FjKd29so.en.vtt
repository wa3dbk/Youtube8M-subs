00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.700
 We're on the motorway now and it's pouring with rain. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 The day is almost over, it's 11pm now and I'm looking forward to my bed! 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.100
 Tomorrow we're off to Mannheim and I think I'll take you back! 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 Sunshine in Koblenz, with cats. Cats are great! 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 We're on the road again, in Koblenz at the moment, before going to Mannheim 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 for a business meeting and the birthday of a good friend of mine. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.000
 Still have a little time for some funny things, like checking out Toys "R" us. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.200
 They actually have guitars here, and even the one I always longed for! I'll give it a try. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 Definitely going straight into my basket! 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.900
 Relaxing at the Moselle right now. It's beautiful here! 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.800
 Time for some minigolf in Koblenz! 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 On the road again, to Mannheim. About 140km to go! 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.200
 You might have wondered why I'm so unbelievably good at vlogging. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200
 I can tell you that I learned this from my music friends Jakob and Felix from Fewjar, 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.700
 they're really good at it. They can not sing, but vlogging is something they can! 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.200
 If you have not yet, check out their new EP, where I'm featured on one track. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.000
 Links are in the description below. Really good music! 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.200
 We're in Mannheim now for my business meeting. It's a little windy! 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.600
 Sunday! It's a short night and I'm going back to Hamburg. 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.200
 I'm at Joschka's place right now, my bass player, if you do not now him. 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 Back home!
