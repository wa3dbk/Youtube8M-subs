 burrito very good to everyone saying that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.130
 we are in minecraft 1.6 points we are going to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.830
 see a minimum because it's really a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 kid that only adds a little something but 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.260
 that is very cool the discarding is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.990
 touching 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.529
 the potato arms the deadliest of the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 weapons let's see the great but in fact 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.050
 thanks potato gun 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.380
 we do a poo and gunpowder chaco to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.100
 it seems a bit weird stone and three of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 iron and we make the potato alarm then 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 with arrows and potato cooked potatoes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:47.030
 eye we make the potatoes arrows is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.660
 pretty good the weapon the rest the mod 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.660
 but it's pretty good 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.739
 let's go to zero 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.870
 if it's just that you do not need 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.649
 load it and that's what it's cool with what 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.649
 keep expelled 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.280
 if I spend a lot of arrows but 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.280
 because I have bad aim 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.300
 Arba potato is a killing machine 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.640
 where to put like that and I want to try it I want 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.640
 try it with the loose normal arrows 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 but well I want to try it with some 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 bug as you see breaks quite 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.030
 easily we have almost loaded the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.119
 half the gun already but master grace the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.970
 potato gun and let's try it with some 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.080
 bug let's try it with this though 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 the arrows I think they do not do anything to him 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.240
 carrying a certain point 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.390
 but I like him, I like him 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.990
 in quotes but ay pam pam pam pam 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990
 this is already removed 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.520
 and that's when it does not take anything away 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.920
 host but the low to half of the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.720

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.620

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.890
