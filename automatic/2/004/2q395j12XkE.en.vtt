00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.699 
now as you can see when I'm is getting
another<00:02:34.790> position<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:36.110> got<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> little<00:02:36.470> tricky

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
another position you got a little tricky

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.009 
another position you got a little tricky
again<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.310> what<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.790> was<00:02:37.970> doing<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:38.989> was

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
again so what I was doing and it was

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.449 
again so what I was doing and it was
kind<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.319> hard<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.500> explain<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.220> was<00:02:40.340> doing

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
kind of hard to explain as I was doing

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.729 
kind of hard to explain as I was doing
it<00:02:40.730> because<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.299> was<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> little<00:02:41.600> bit<00:02:41.780> occupied

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
it because it was a little bit occupied

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.430 
it because it was a little bit occupied
at<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.890> time<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.630> basically<00:02:44.630> bring<00:02:45.230> them

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
at the time but basically bring them

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.890 
at the time but basically bring them
both<00:02:45.560> together<00:02:45.799> again<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.519> then<00:02:46.900> pressing

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
both together again and then pressing

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.690 
both together again and then pressing
together<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.319> they're<00:02:48.440> stabilized<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.130> then

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
together so they're stabilized and then

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.150 
together so they're stabilized and then
move<00:02:50.269> your<00:02:50.390> hands<00:02:50.569> down<00:02:51.410> as<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.769> accept<00:02:52.069> those

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160
