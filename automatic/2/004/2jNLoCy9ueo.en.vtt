00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.220
 how much does a company cost? 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.600
 telephone 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.640
 a question that everyone is a bit 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.889
 places finally saw the answer 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.320
 well a text message costs nothing 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.180
 exactly nothing is not a 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.129
 way to say that they are cheap but 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.710
 they really cost nothing, they don't cost 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.150
 a beloved this answer is not 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.130
 spaced in the air but there are the facts that 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.990
 they document it first we do 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.869
 clarity on the road that text messages use 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.730
 to travel these small packages 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.109
 of information travels incorporated in 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.680
 signal that connects the phone to the 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.059
 signal repeater that is always active is 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.800
 a bit like our mobile phone 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.140
 always sent empty messages to 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.899
 repeater these fortunately not there 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.250
 we pay but then why pay 15 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.870
 cents for a service that 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.969
 the operator costs nothing 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.280
 think about this transmission system 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.190
 information is also the cause of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.199
 character limit for each message 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.160
 let's think of a two-lane road 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.320
 more than two machines can go there 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.350
 at the same time it is made for this 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.670
 need to send two text messages 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.790
 now that you know the truth you do not feel 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.740
 to show you don't feel pissed off 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.330
 yes and this is why this video will be 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.390
 carpeted with obscenities censored by 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.500
 some vip here is how our spend 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.820
 Money from these companies will be 7 which has 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.270
 reason goes first to me should plug 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.689
 Internet 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.219

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.390
 with the help of the 5-star movement 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.460
 we can finally say goodbye to these 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.929
 company of me and welcomes a 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.909
 service that really believes in 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.259
 communication is really asking for it 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.039
 strictly necessary for his 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.069
 survival 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.360
 I refer to skype of course 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.369
 in fact you can call landlines and 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.030
 furniture at 2 cents a minute I'm not 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.250
 joking 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.100
 the price is totally zero if who 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.600
 receives the call to skype this reality 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.340
 but he needs your help 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.899
 the movement needs your help 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.509

 we do and how you can participate but 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.069
 since the movement does not point to 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.899
 power the movement has as unique 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.549
 objective the well-being of citizens vi 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.709

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.959

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.849

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.010
 of the fact that telephone companies e 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.629

 send SMS to the modest amount of 8 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.359
 cents but the price can go down to 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.970
 a penny if the recipient of the message 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.739

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.230
