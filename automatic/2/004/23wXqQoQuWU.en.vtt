00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello everyone I'm mister manicio and 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.570
 I extract the first review of a mod the 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.180
 world it's about ultra h the storm 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.309
 close and city awards mod made by 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.130
 frank family go through their profile 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.170
 because it has other textures and other 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.660
 many very interesting 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.510
 the mortal is in a re- texture of the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.920
 armor of all of all the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.939
 guards and all the cities and the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.340
 cafes of the storm at 2k and 4k are the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.690
 two versions available on the web 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.879
 world 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.680
 the world only increases the quality of 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.890
 textures but that also adds 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.539
 small details on the clothes changes 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.539
 some things that we will see later 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.420
 the helmet is also different or has 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.420
 could appreciate right now 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.870
 you can also see that on the clothes 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.500
 add this emblem of the fields of 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.630
 storm and good this does it in all 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.620
 the clothes of all the guards of all 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.620
 skype cities 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.020
 right now you can see a comparison 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.740
 of the mod at a glance and can be 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.200
 appreciate small details that good 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 always give a better touch to skyteam 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.180
 also make a texture of the shields 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.119
 as you can see on the left the shield 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.079
 textured on ultra hd and on the right 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.079
 the vanilla shield 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.780
 this adds it to all the shields of 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.810
 all the guards of all cities 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.460
 of skype thing that good was very good 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.340
 since always in the background the textures 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.229
 of the skyrim guards are 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.020
 practically the same but different 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.700
 colors and here then the mother and has done 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 something 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.460
 and they already give something different game 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.790
 here you can see the scoring textures 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.860
 in vanilla and good are going to appreciate 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.140
 these scales that are leather 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.020
 and that the mod changes metal now what 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.550
 We will see more 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.550
 more concrete precision 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.010
 well here you can see the slaves that 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.900
 They are metal 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.000
 which also has more logic because 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.769
 clear if the mesh that has what is the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.989
 in the arms is metal because it has 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.849
 to be leather but good also 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.790
 you can see that a little shield the helmet 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.650
 that is fine and nothing this is the mod that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.390
 I brought you today I hope that I have 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.190

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.799

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.650
 facilitate in the description and good nothing 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.430
 there are more favorites to subscribe because it's going 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.019
 to have much more 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.019
