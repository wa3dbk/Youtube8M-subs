00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
scene with a torus in a sphere so I've

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.329 
scene with a torus in a sphere so I've
already<00:00:56.530> got<00:00:56.649> my<00:00:58.199> IC<00:00:59.199> mass<00:00:59.379> flow<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.859> HDR

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.550 
studio rig from greyscale gorilla in the
scene<00:01:04.510> but<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:04.809> can<00:01:04.989> use<00:01:05.110> whatever<00:01:05.290> you

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
scene but you can use whatever you

scene but you can use whatever you
should<00:01:05.590> use<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.799> floor<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.549> whatever<00:01:07.540> you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780

should use a floor and whatever you
don't<00:01:07.869> really<00:01:08.049> need<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.260> lot<00:01:08.500> but<00:01:08.530> anyway<00:01:09.159> the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
don't really need a lot but anyway the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.450 
don't really need a lot but anyway the
objects<00:01:09.700> I'm<00:01:09.909> just<00:01:10.090> gonna<00:01:10.180> use<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.360> torus<00:01:11.460> which

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
objects I'm just gonna use a torus which

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.270 
objects I'm just gonna use a torus which
is<00:01:12.640> bringing<00:01:13.210> up<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.450> little<00:01:13.600> bit<00:01:13.900> zoom<00:01:14.830> out<00:01:15.040> and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
is bringing up a little bit zoom out and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.980 
is bringing up a little bit zoom out and
the<00:01:15.580> little<00:01:15.880> lines<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.360> outside<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.870> want

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the little lines on the outside you want

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.870 
the little lines on the outside you want
to<00:01:17.050> bring<00:01:17.290> in<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:18.160> decrease<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.670> ring

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
to bring in it just decrease the ring

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.760 
to bring in it just decrease the ring
radius<00:01:19.390> so<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:19.990> kind<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.230> looks<00:01:20.410> like<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.590> really

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
radius so it kind of looks like a really

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.280 
radius so it kind of looks like a really
big<00:01:21.040> like<00:01:21.460> tire<00:01:22.210> or<00:01:22.540> something<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.050> don't<00:01:23.110> know

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
big like tire or something I don't know

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.960 
big like tire or something I don't know
and<00:01:23.770> then<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.130> just<00:01:24.250> want<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.400> like<00:01:24.580> rotate

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
and then you just want to like rotate

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.120 
and then you just want to like rotate
that<00:01:25.090> around<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.480> little<00:01:25.510> bit<00:01:25.920> make<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.040> look

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
that around a little bit make that look

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.210 
that around a little bit make that look
a<00:01:27.250> bit<00:01:27.400> nice<00:01:28.320> could<00:01:29.320> always<00:01:29.440> like<00:01:29.710> increase

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
a bit nice could always like increase

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.190 
a bit nice could always like increase
segments<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:30.910> stuff<00:01:31.180> but<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.810> be<00:01:31.900> honest<00:01:32.110> I'm

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
segments and stuff but to be honest I'm

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.470 
segments and stuff but to be honest I'm
not<00:01:32.230> really<00:01:32.440> going<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.710> bother<00:01:32.890> with<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:33.480> and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
not really going to bother with that and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.030 
not really going to bother with that and
then<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.690> want<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.900> bring<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.170> your<00:01:35.260> sphere

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
then you want to bring in your sphere

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.370 
then you want to bring in your sphere
I<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.150> decrease<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.660> lot<00:01:40.230> scale<00:01:41.230> that

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
I want to decrease that a lot scale that

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.899 
I want to decrease that a lot scale that
down

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
down

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.120 
down
let's<00:01:43.450> get<00:01:43.600> down<00:01:43.960> that<00:01:44.200> should<00:01:44.350> be<00:01:44.499> alright<00:01:44.740> go

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
let's get down that should be alright go

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.359 
let's get down that should be alright go
into<00:01:45.369> top<00:01:45.579> view<00:01:45.960> place<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.229> alongside<00:01:47.469> in

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
into top view place that alongside in

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.270 
into top view place that alongside in
inside<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.299> Taurus<00:01:49.749> just<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:50.890> gives<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.219> a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
inside the Taurus just so it gives it a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.399 
inside the Taurus just so it gives it a
lot<00:01:51.490> nice<00:01:52.770> reflections<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.689> glows<00:01:55.689> on<00:01:56.079> to<00:01:56.319> the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
lot nice reflections and glows on to the

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.559 
lot nice reflections and glows on to the
Taurus<00:01:56.770> because<00:01:57.609> you<00:01:57.700> might<00:01:57.850> not<00:01:57.999> miss<00:01:58.270> that

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
Taurus because you might not miss that

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.719 
Taurus because you might not miss that
if<00:01:58.749> you<00:01:58.869> did<00:01:59.049> in<00:01:59.170> tune<00:01:59.319> or<00:01:59.439> 4d<00:01:59.770> so<00:02:00.459> you<00:02:00.549> can<00:02:00.670> we

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
if you did in tune or 4d so you can we

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.120 
if you did in tune or 4d so you can we
just<00:02:00.909> scale<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.270> back<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.600> again<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:03.780> yep

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
just scale that back up again and yep

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.130 
just scale that back up again and yep
that's<00:02:06.130> looking<00:02:06.490> alright<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:07.090> be<00:02:07.209> fair<00:02:07.509> and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
want to put reflection on say let's do

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.770 
want to put reflection on say let's do
the<00:02:17.980> tourists<00:02:18.760> first<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.360> let's<00:02:19.480> not<00:02:19.599> worry

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the tourists first and let's not worry

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.680 
the tourists first and let's not worry
about<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.019> glowy<00:02:20.200> sphere<00:02:20.819> deve<00:02:21.819> usual<00:02:22.480> for

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
about the glowy sphere deve usual for

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.339 
about the glowy sphere deve usual for
now<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:24.629> bring<00:02:25.629> that<00:02:25.750> down<00:02:25.930> quite<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.260> bit

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
now and bring that down quite a bit

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.289 
now and bring that down quite a bit
we've<00:02:26.920> done<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.190> too<00:02:27.459> reflective<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.150> always

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
we've done it too reflective and always

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.539 
we've done it too reflective and always
starts<00:02:28.599> looking<00:02:28.810> horrible<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.069> keep<00:02:30.489> that

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
starts looking horrible and we keep that

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.770 
starts looking horrible and we keep that
as<00:02:30.730> white<00:02:31.000> dump<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.629> on<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.829> Taurus<00:02:33.629> zoom<00:02:34.629> in

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
as white dump that on the Taurus zoom in

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.610 
as white dump that on the Taurus zoom in
a<00:02:34.840> little<00:02:34.930> bit

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a little bit

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.740 
a little bit
move<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.519> sphere<00:02:36.790> down<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.180> want<00:02:37.329> to<00:02:37.390> pay<00:02:37.510> for

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
move that sphere down I want to pay for

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.190 
move that sphere down I want to pay for
too<00:02:37.900> much<00:02:38.079> like<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.829> big<00:02:38.980> donut<00:02:39.609> really<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
too much like a big donut really and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.619 
too much like a big donut really and
make<00:02:41.200> another<00:02:41.440> material<00:02:41.739> for<00:02:42.190> your<00:02:42.629> global

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
make another material for your global

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.440 
make another material for your global
sphere<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.549> make<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.879> reflective

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
sphere and you can make that reflective

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.420 
sphere and you can make that reflective
as<00:02:46.540> well<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.049> don't<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.470> reflective

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
as well but you don't have to reflective

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.020 
as well but you don't have to reflective
again

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
again

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.050

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
so maybe 7 in about 14 I like to make

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.099 
so maybe 7 in about 14 I like to make
this<00:02:52.150> color<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:53.019> blowy<00:02:54.359> wait<00:02:55.359> wait<00:02:55.780> umm

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109

there<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.680> preview<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.609> could<00:03:03.760> always

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there to preview but you could always

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
there to preview but you could always
use<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:05.340> choose<00:03:06.340> material<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.510> choose<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
use the choose material in choose a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.319 
use the choose material in choose a
color<00:03:08.139> for<00:03:08.410> your<00:03:08.470> sphere<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.220> side<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.120> glow

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
color for your sphere in side the glow

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.690 
color for your sphere in side the glow
tab<00:03:10.660> which<00:03:11.380> makes<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.829> glow<00:03:12.040> obviously<00:03:12.459> stand

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
tab which makes the glow obviously stand

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.430 
tab which makes the glow obviously stand
out<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:12.849> lot<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.599> can<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.930> play

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
out a lot more and you can just play

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.569 
out a lot more and you can just play
around<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> brightness<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.370> way

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
around with the brightness this way

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.930 
around with the brightness this way
easier<00:03:16.090> brightness<00:03:16.810> off<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.169> glow<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.940> see

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
easier brightness off the glow and see

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.640 
easier brightness off the glow and see
for<00:03:19.239> one<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.569> there<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.930> only<00:03:20.049> just<00:03:20.319> speed

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
for one of it there it only just speed

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.509 
for one of it there it only just speed
but<00:03:20.859> there<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.639> like<00:03:21.910> very<00:03:22.510> bright<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.560> so

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
but there it's like very bright and so

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.830 
but there it's like very bright and so
yeah<00:03:24.669> it's<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.940> inner<00:03:25.090> strength<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:25.599> how<00:03:25.690> much

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
yeah it's the inner strength so how much

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.900 
yeah it's the inner strength so how much
it<00:03:26.019> glows<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> actual<00:03:27.400> object<00:03:27.519> of

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
it glows on to the actual object of

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.180 
it glows on to the actual object of
sphere<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.359> this<00:03:28.480> case<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.010> radius

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
sphere in this case and so the radius

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.210 
sphere in this case and so the radius
shows<00:03:30.910> how<00:03:31.450> far<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.109> glow<00:03:32.889> is<00:03:32.950> going<00:03:33.160> to

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
shows how far out the glow is going to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.729 
shows how far out the glow is going to
be<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:34.060> yeah<00:03:34.599> so<00:03:35.139> once<00:03:35.290> you've<00:03:35.440> got<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.680> you

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
be so yeah so once you've got that you

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.470 
be so yeah so once you've got that you
want<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.010> come<00:03:36.130> into<00:03:36.280> render<00:03:36.910> settings<00:03:37.239> an
