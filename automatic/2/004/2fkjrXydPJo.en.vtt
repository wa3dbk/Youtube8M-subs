though is that this actual site says the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
though is that this actual site says the

camera either way though I would bet my

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.500 
camera either way though I would bet my
bottom<00:01:59.610> dollar<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.180> when

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
bottom dollar that when

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.390 
bottom dollar that when
five<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.230> have<00:02:01.380> startup<00:02:01.830> with<00:02:01.980> moments

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
five is gonna have startup with moments

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.820 
five is gonna have startup with moments
in<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.610> area<00:02:02.970> so<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.900> these<00:02:04.110> specifications

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
in this area so if these specifications

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.410 
in this area so if these specifications
turn<00:02:05.010> out<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.280> true<00:02:05.580> which<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.030> seeming

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
turn out to be true which is seeming

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.090 
turn out to be true which is seeming
likely<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.900> minute<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> me<00:02:07.740> five<00:02:07.980> is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
likely at the minute and the me five is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.650 
likely at the minute and the me five is
gonna<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.400> something<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.119> 30%

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
gonna have something like a 30%

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.870 
gonna have something like a 30%

that is HUGE I mean to give you an idea

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
that is HUGE I mean to give you an idea
the<00:02:21.450> difference<00:02:22.200> between<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> Snapdragon

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the difference between the Snapdragon

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.340 
the difference between the Snapdragon

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
800 and the Snapdragon 801 that followed

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.620 
800 and the Snapdragon 801 that followed
it<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> next<00:02:25.950> year<00:02:26.100> was<00:02:26.850> something<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
it in the next year was something like a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.690 
it in the next year was something like a
5<00:02:27.930> percent<00:02:28.290> difference<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.250> cherry<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.610> top

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
5 percent difference the cherry on top

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.060 
5 percent difference the cherry on top
here<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> 820<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.410> also<00:02:31.710> fitted<00:02:31.890> with

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
here is that the 820 is also fitted with

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.550 
here is that the 820 is also fitted with
a<00:02:32.190> brand<00:02:32.520> new<00:02:32.610> cat<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.510> LTE<00:02:33.960> modem<00:02:34.260> which

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
a brand new cat and LTE modem which

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
a brand new cat and LTE modem which
offers<00:02:34.860> download<00:02:35.220> speeds<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> four

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
offers download speeds of up to four

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.240 
offers download speeds of up to four
hundred<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.900> fifty<00:02:37.230> megabytes<00:02:37.500> per<00:02:37.740> second

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
hundred and fifty megabytes per second

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.760 
hundred and fifty megabytes per second
so<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> mean<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> summarize<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.230> premier<00:02:40.560> five

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
so I mean to summarize and premier five

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.490 
so I mean to summarize and premier five
is<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.490> one<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.850> wait<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.930> may<00:02:43.170> end<00:02:43.350> up

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
is really one to wait for it may end up

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.290 
is really one to wait for it may end up
costing<00:02:43.740> more<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
costing more but this is going to be the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.910 
costing more but this is going to be the
best<00:02:45.570> device<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.320> world<00:02:46.560> when<00:02:46.800> it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
best device in the world when it

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.070 
best device in the world when it
releases<00:02:47.180> thanks<00:02:48.180> watching<00:02:48.540> guys<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.960> I
