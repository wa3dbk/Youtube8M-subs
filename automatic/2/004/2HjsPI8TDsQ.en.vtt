little detail stuff just for looks now
here's<00:01:06.130> how<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.340> got<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.850> fire<00:01:07.390> box<00:01:07.689> attached

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
here's how I got the fire box attached

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.980 
here's how I got the fire box attached
to<00:01:08.469> the<00:01:08.829> heater

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.920 

this<00:01:14.920> door<00:01:15.220> is<00:01:16.799> still<00:01:17.970> still<00:01:18.970> usable<00:01:19.630> but

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
this door is still still usable but

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.149 
this door is still still usable but
what's<00:01:20.320> on<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.500> other<00:01:20.649> side<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:20.979> right<00:01:21.130> now

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
what's on the other side of it right now

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.100 
what's on the other side of it right now
is<00:01:21.280> firebrick<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:23.950> just<00:01:24.159> use<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
is firebrick so I just use that to to

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.260 
is firebrick so I just use that to to
get<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.350> thing<00:01:26.560> going<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.130> for<00:01:27.430> some<00:01:27.640> initial

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
get the thing going so for some initial

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.590 
get the thing going so for some initial
air<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.659> have<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.740> do<00:01:32.890> some<00:01:33.100> sealing<00:01:33.640> right

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
air I have to do some sealing right

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.820 
air I have to do some sealing right
along<00:01:34.899> here<00:01:35.289> and<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:37.000> seam<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.170> this

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
along here and and this seam and this

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.389 
along here and and this seam and this
seam<00:01:39.159> will<00:01:40.090> be<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.530> see<00:01:41.679> some<00:01:41.860> hot<00:01:42.070> coals

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
seam will be you can see some hot coals

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.919 
seam will be you can see some hot coals
and<00:01:42.670> therefore<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.090> get<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> camera<00:01:43.750> just

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
and therefore you get the camera just

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.730 
and therefore you get the camera just
right<00:01:44.289> there<00:01:46.020> those<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:49.350> sealed<00:01:50.350> up<00:01:50.560> with

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
right there those of the sealed up with

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.399 
right there those of the sealed up with
fire<00:01:51.310> caulk<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.030> then<00:01:52.509> every<00:01:53.049> time<00:01:53.229> it's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
fire caulk and then every time it's

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.559 
fire caulk and then every time it's
taken<00:01:53.740> apart<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.220> put<00:01:54.340> back<00:01:54.520> together<00:01:54.700> it'll

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
taken apart to put back together it'll

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.109 
taken apart to put back together it'll
get<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.840> new<00:01:56.140> new<00:01:56.799> betta<00:01:57.069> silica<00:02:00.119> thermometer

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
get a new new betta silica thermometer

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:17.270 
get a new new betta silica thermometer
out<00:02:05.009> okay<00:02:08.910> start<00:02:09.910> at<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> bottom<00:02:13.019> 120<00:02:14.019> degrees

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:28.390 

learn<00:02:18.280> 30<00:02:18.959> right<00:02:19.959> there

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.170 

and<00:02:28.940> then<00:02:29.299> at<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> very<00:02:29.720> top

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.420 

to<00:02:34.780> 60s<00:02:35.349> but<00:02:35.590> how<00:02:36.219> does<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.489> can<00:02:36.609> get<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.849> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
to 60s but how does I can get it and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.080 
to 60s but how does I can get it and
let's<00:02:39.430> check<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.909> stack<00:02:40.150> temperature

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:58.260 

13<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.960> red<00:02:49.170> dot

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.290 

this<00:02:58.930> versus<00:02:59.590> heat<00:02:59.770> pretty<00:03:00.100> quick<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:01.150> like

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
this versus heat pretty quick it's like

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.230 
this versus heat pretty quick it's like
85<00:03:01.720> degrees

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.670 

I'd<00:03:09.240> say<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.600> pretty<00:03:09.960> good<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.410> go<00:03:10.530> from

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
I'd say that's pretty good we go from

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:19.130 
I'd say that's pretty good we go from
250<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.490> on<00:03:11.640> top<00:03:12.770> down<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:14.130> 80<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:18.600> that's

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
250 right on top down to 80 so that's

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.300 
250 right on top down to 80 so that's
the<00:03:19.410> that's<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.280> rocket<00:03:20.730> heater<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.240> far<00:03:22.310> some

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the that's the rocket heater so far some

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.250 
the that's the rocket heater so far some
final<00:03:23.610> detail<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:25.700> now<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.730> got<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.110> prep<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
final detail and now I got a prep the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.440 
final detail and now I got a prep the
spot<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.800> get<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.670> installed<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.270> house

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
spot to get it installed in the house

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.810 
spot to get it installed in the house
but<00:03:30.960> I'm<00:03:31.290> gonna<00:03:31.440> want<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.070> burn<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> off<00:03:32.550> out

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
but I'm gonna want to burn it off out

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.880 
but I'm gonna want to burn it off out
