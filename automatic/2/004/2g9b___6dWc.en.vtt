up we got the Crypt in sharpness
particles<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.860> how<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> creat

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
particles and this is how to creat

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 
particles and this is how to creat
particles<00:02:30.700> look<00:02:30.880> they're<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.390> apples<00:02:31.930> like

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
particles look they're just apples like

the<00:02:32.380> bokor<00:02:32.710> kills<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.180> chakras

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the bokor kills and then the chakras

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.240 
the bokor kills and then the chakras
particles<00:02:34.990> first<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.620> need<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.770> go<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.010> chance

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
particles first we need to go in chance

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.920 
particles first we need to go in chance
so<00:02:36.490> this<00:02:36.640> side<00:02:36.820> enchanting<00:02:37.330> dry<00:02:37.600> looks<00:02:37.840> as

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
so this side enchanting dry looks as

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.140 
so this side enchanting dry looks as
well<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.380> let's<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.220> some<00:02:39.370> sharpness<00:02:39.670> there

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
well and let's get some sharpness there

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
there we go next up we got the water

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.770 
there we go next up we got the water
this<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.280> Luke's<00:03:03.550> underwater<00:03:04.120> yes<00:03:04.450> looks<00:03:04.630> like

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
this pretty clear so you can print ACC

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.520 
this pretty clear so you can print ACC
when<00:03:06.940> you're<00:03:07.060> pvping<00:03:07.450> underwater<00:03:07.870> which<00:03:08.410> is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
when you're pvping underwater which is

least we have the survival inventory and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.610 
least we have the survival inventory and
this<00:03:22.300> is<00:03:22.480> how<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.660> survival<00:03:23.110> inventory<00:03:23.440> looks

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
as you can see it's clear then the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
as you can see it's clear then the
crafting<00:03:25.780> table<00:03:25.840> thing<00:03:26.350> has<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.770> think<00:03:26.830> that's

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
crafting table thing has I think that's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.070

his<00:03:27.430> face<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.940> would<00:03:28.090> assume<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.540> his<00:03:28.690> face<00:03:28.900> at

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080
