the<00:00:19.140> USB<00:00:20.420> connector<00:00:21.420> seems<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.960> fail<00:00:22.170> sort<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the USB connector seems to fail sort of

the USB connector seems to fail sort of
an<00:00:23.310> infamous<00:00:23.760> problem<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.269> these<00:00:24.449> other

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
an infamous problem with these other

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.929 
an infamous problem with these other
than<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> great<00:00:25.680> keyboard<00:00:26.070> mine

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
than that it's a great keyboard mine

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.580 
than that it's a great keyboard mine
hasn't<00:00:27.269> failed<00:00:27.420> yet<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.320> why

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
hasn't failed yet but I think I know why

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.020 
hasn't failed yet but I think I know why
other<00:00:29.550> peoples<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.449> failed<00:00:31.790> see<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:32.910> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
other peoples have failed see how that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.340 
other peoples have failed see how that
connector<00:00:33.420> there<00:00:33.570> has<00:00:33.750> nothing<00:00:34.050> else

connector there has nothing else

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.810 
connector there has nothing else
supporting<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.100> other<00:00:35.250> than<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> solder

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.190 
holding it in if your rough with that
connector<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.510> probably<00:00:39.899> break<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
connector it will probably break the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
connector it will probably break the
solder<00:00:40.410> joints<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:41.040> time<00:00:41.270> now<00:00:42.270> you'd<00:00:42.420> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
solder joints over time now you'd think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.770 
solder joints over time now you'd think
that<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> top<00:00:43.320> cover<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.920> they'd<00:00:44.070> have

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
that in the top cover here they'd have

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.209 
that in the top cover here they'd have
something<00:00:45.780> by<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> hole<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> help

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
something by the hole here to help

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.889 
something by the hole here to help
stabilize<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.000> connector<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.600> keep<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
stabilize that connector and keep it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
stabilize that connector and keep it
held<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.739> don't<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.420> is

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
held down but they don't that I think is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
held down but they don't that I think is
why<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.840> thing<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.489> connector<00:00:53.879> fails

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
why this thing this connector fails

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
why this thing this connector fails
there's<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> two<00:00:55.350> possibilities<00:00:55.829> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
there's one of two possibilities it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.459 
there's one of two possibilities it's
either<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.850> design<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.420> design<00:00:57.870> flaw<00:00:58.170> where

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
either the design a design flaw where

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
either the design a design flaw where
that<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> not<00:01:00.379> stabilized

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that this thing is just not stabilized

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
that this thing is just not stabilized
by<00:01:01.559> anything<00:01:01.859> other<00:01:02.129> than<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> solder

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
by anything other than the solder

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.789 
by anything other than the solder
holding<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.149> down<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.350> plain<00:01:04.619> bad

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
holding it down or is just plain bad

doesn't<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.670> horrible<00:01:08.850> I'll<00:01:09.780> show<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> what

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
doesn't look horrible I'll show you what

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.850 
doesn't look horrible I'll show you what
it<00:01:10.229> looks<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:15.110> see<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> bottom

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it looks like here see on the bottom

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.060 
it looks like here see on the bottom
there<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.490> three<00:01:18.229> three<00:01:19.229> connectors<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
there there are three three connectors I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.020 
there there are three three connectors I
guess<00:01:20.250> maybe<00:01:20.640> four<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:22.820> yeah<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:23.970> were

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
guess maybe four actually yeah they were

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.520 
guess maybe four actually yeah they were
like<00:01:24.210> four<00:01:24.540> they're<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.259> bunch<00:01:25.409> of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
like four they're like a bunch of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
like four they're like a bunch of
connectors<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.250> clumped<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.790> together

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
connectors just clumped up together

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
connectors just clumped up together
right<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:28.080> soldering<00:01:28.560> joints

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
right there so your soldering joints

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.030 
right there so your soldering joints
have<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.520> tight<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.810> those<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.439> as

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
have to be really tight for those and as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
have to be really tight for those and as
you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> stabilization<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> these

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you can see the stabilization is these

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140 
you can see the stabilization is these
two<00:01:34.259> soldering<00:01:35.189> joints<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.939> just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
two soldering joints here it just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.600 
two soldering joints here it just
they're<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.750> held<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.950> held<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.340> by

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
they're just held on it's held on by

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.240 
they're just held on it's held on by
those<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.180> those<00:01:39.630> alone<00:01:39.960> nothing<00:01:40.799> else<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
those and those alone nothing else and I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
those and those alone nothing else and I
think<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> major<00:01:42.180> flaw<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
think that is the major flaw with this

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
think that is the major flaw with this
USB<00:01:43.500> connector<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.460> held<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> by

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
USB connector it's just not held in by

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.990 
USB connector it's just not held in by
any<00:01:45.270> thing<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.170> stabilized<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.369> either<00:01:47.640> side

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
any thing or stabilized on either side

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.050 
any thing or stabilized on either side
of<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.880> that's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
of it or on top of it and I think that's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.350 
of it or on top of it and I think that's
why<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> fails<00:01:52.520> mine<00:01:53.520> has<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.880> failed<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
why it fails mine has not failed so I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.130 
why it fails mine has not failed so I
can't<00:01:54.720> confirm<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:56.509> again<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> two

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
can't confirm that but again the two

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
can't confirm that but again the two
possibilities<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:58.979> mind<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.549> bad

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
possibilities in my mind are bad

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.889 
possibilities in my mind are bad
soldering<00:02:00.360> work<00:02:00.619> or<00:02:01.820> simply<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.689> lack<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
soldering work or simply just a lack of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
soldering work or simply just a lack of
stabilization<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.950> connector<00:02:05.369> thought

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
stabilization for that connector thought

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.779 
stabilization for that connector thought
I'd<00:02:06.090> show<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:07.140> than<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> USB<00:02:08.489> port

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I'd show that other than that USB port

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
I'd show that other than that USB port
these<00:02:09.000> Rosewell<00:02:09.810> keyboards<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.440> actually
