00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.490
 with one of the drivers who is actually in the sector 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.480
 and the two days later stood in the racks 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.440
 we wanted to change something 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.850
 I had to do the axes in practice on Sunday evening 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.910

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.500
 with it 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.670
 when you have to stop 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.180
 That keeps being a bit exceptional but on

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.330
