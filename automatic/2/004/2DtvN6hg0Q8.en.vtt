00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
to talk about I new power up in map pack

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.920 
to talk about I new power up in map pack
three<00:00:17.020> or<00:00:17.439> map<00:00:17.560> pack<00:00:17.740> for<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:19.359> before<00:00:19.720> we<00:00:19.810> get

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
three or map pack for but before we get

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
the second question is what do I look

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.910 
the second question is what do I look
like<00:00:37.090> I<00:00:37.480> will<00:00:37.960> put<00:00:38.110> a<00:00:38.140> picture<00:00:38.350> on<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.800> screen

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
like I will put a picture on the screen

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.890 
like I will put a picture on the screen
of<00:00:39.400> a<00:00:39.820> bunch<00:00:40.090> of<00:00:40.180> people<00:00:40.240> and<00:00:40.540> you<00:00:40.630> guys<00:00:40.750> have

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
of a bunch of people and you guys have

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.020 
of a bunch of people and you guys have
to<00:00:40.960> guess<00:00:41.200> which<00:00:41.290> one's<00:00:41.590> me<00:00:41.740> but<00:00:42.400> let's<00:00:42.790> get<00:00:42.940> on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
to guess which one's me but let's get on

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.020 
to guess which one's me but let's get on
with<00:00:43.060> the<00:00:43.240> video<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.010> video<00:00:45.250> being<00:00:45.520> if

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
with the video so the video being if

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.610 
with the video so the video being if
there's<00:00:46.390> going<00:00:46.630> to<00:00:46.720> be<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:46.810> new<00:00:47.020> power<00:00:47.200> up<00:00:47.470> in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
there's going to be a new power up in

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.680 
there's going to be a new power up in
that<00:00:47.770> fact<00:00:47.980> three<00:00:48.190> or<00:00:48.280> map<00:00:48.400> for<00:00:48.790> so<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.540> reason

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
that fact three or map for so the reason

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.360 
that fact three or map for so the reason
why<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:49.960> believe<00:00:50.350> there's<00:00:50.680> going<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.070> be<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.190> new

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
why I believe there's going to be a new

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.580 
why I believe there's going to be a new
power<00:00:51.610> up<00:00:51.760> is<00:00:51.880> because<00:00:52.030> since<00:00:52.900> transit<00:00:53.470> or

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
power up is because since transit or

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.100 
power up is because since transit or
green<00:00:53.920> run<00:00:54.130> we<00:00:54.310> haven't<00:00:54.730> seen<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.240> new<00:00:55.690> power<00:00:55.930> up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
green run we haven't seen a new power up

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.090 
green run we haven't seen a new power up
so<00:00:56.320> far<00:00:56.620> we've<00:00:56.920> seen<00:00:57.510> persistent<00:00:58.510> perks<00:00:58.780> but

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so far we've seen persistent perks but

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.190 
so far we've seen persistent perks but
we<00:01:00.100> haven't<00:01:00.370> seen<00:01:00.730> any<00:01:00.970> new<00:01:01.060> power-ups<00:01:01.690> drops

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
we haven't seen any new power-ups drops

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.229 
we haven't seen any new power-ups drops
whatever<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.220> like<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.400> call<00:01:03.520> them<00:01:03.820> we

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
whatever you like to call them we

whatever you like to call them we
haven't<00:01:04.449> seen<00:01:04.689> a<00:01:04.750> new<00:01:04.960> one<00:01:05.170> if<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.950> don't

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
haven't seen a new one if you don't

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.670 
haven't seen a new one if you don't
remember<00:01:06.430> from<00:01:06.790> black<00:01:07.000> ops<00:01:07.210> 1<00:01:07.329> there<00:01:08.049> was<00:01:08.350> a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
remember from black ops 1 there was a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.820 
remember from black ops 1 there was a
new<00:01:09.310> one<00:01:09.520> like<00:01:09.729> death<00:01:10.119> machine<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:11.650> was

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
new one like death machine there was

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.180 
new one like death machine there was
also<00:01:12.240> fire<00:01:13.240> sale<00:01:13.600> they<00:01:14.170> made<00:01:14.350> new<00:01:14.530> ones<00:01:14.560> but<00:01:15.010> in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
also fire sale they made new ones but in

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.399 
also fire sale they made new ones but in
black<00:01:15.430> ops<00:01:15.640> 2<00:01:15.760> we<00:01:16.120> haven't<00:01:16.570> got<00:01:16.750> any<00:01:16.990> new<00:01:17.230> ones

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
black ops 2 we haven't got any new ones

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.240 
black ops 2 we haven't got any new ones
yet<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:19.240> these<00:01:19.390> are<00:01:19.630> all<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.350> drops<00:01:20.710> or<00:01:21.040> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
yet now these are all the drops or the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.580 
yet now these are all the drops or the
power-ups<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:22.030> we've<00:01:22.659> seen<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.260> far<00:01:23.290> in

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
power-ups that we've seen so far in

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.480 
power-ups that we've seen so far in
black<00:01:23.979> ops<00:01:24.190> 2<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:25.330> insta-kill<00:01:26.200> double<00:01:26.560> points

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
black ops 2 so insta-kill double points

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.370 
black ops 2 so insta-kill double points
max<00:01:28.090> ammo<00:01:28.450> nuke<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.510> forth<00:01:31.540> now<00:01:32.320> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
max ammo nuke and so on so forth now the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.350 
max ammo nuke and so on so forth now the
perk<00:01:32.710> bottle<00:01:33.280> was<00:01:33.490> something<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.060> little<00:01:34.180> bit

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
perk bottle was something a little bit

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.440 
perk bottle was something a little bit
new<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:35.260> um<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:36.070> was<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.430> black<00:01:36.670> ops<00:01:36.940> 1<00:01:37.090> as

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
new but um that was in black ops 1 as

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.270 
new but um that was in black ops 1 as
well<00:01:37.479> because<00:01:38.110> if<00:01:38.409> you<00:01:38.530> killed<00:01:38.740> George<00:01:39.070> you'd

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
well because if you killed George you'd

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.700 
well because if you killed George you'd
get<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> free<00:01:39.970> perk<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.479> it'd<00:01:41.049> be<00:01:41.200> dropped<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:41.620> a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
get a free perk and it'd be dropped in a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.060 
get a free perk and it'd be dropped in a
bottle<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.540> yeah<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:43.900> that's<00:01:44.380> not<00:01:44.620> basically

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
bottle and yeah so that's not basically

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.060 
bottle and yeah so that's not basically
new<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.670> haven't<00:01:46.030> seen<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.479> new<00:01:46.659> one<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.080> far<00:01:47.350> so

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
new we haven't seen a new one so far so

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.399 
new we haven't seen a new one so far so
this<00:01:48.580> is<00:01:48.760> what<00:01:48.940> makes<00:01:49.150> me<00:01:49.360> believe<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:50.080> there

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
this is what makes me believe that there

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.440 
this is what makes me believe that there
is<00:01:50.440> going<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.979> be<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.670> new<00:01:51.790> power<00:01:52.030> up<00:01:52.299> in

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
is going to be the new power up in

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.090 
is going to be the new power up in
