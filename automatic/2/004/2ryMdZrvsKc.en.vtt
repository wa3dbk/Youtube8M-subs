00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
it and then possibly repurchase it so

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
but I've always really liked it when

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.950

I've<00:04:09.610> sampled<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:10.120> install<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.780> hopefully

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
I've sampled it install so hopefully

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.480

this<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.410> chance<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:11.800> me<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.010> start

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
this is a chance for me to start

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.250 
this is a chance for me to start
enjoying<00:04:12.760> something<00:04:13.090> new<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.600> second<00:04:14.110> last

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
enjoying something new a second last

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.410 
enjoying something new a second last
thing<00:04:14.470> that's<00:04:14.620> in<00:04:14.770> my<00:04:14.890> box<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.850> do<00:04:16.090> I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
thing that's in my box is this in do I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.930 
thing that's in my box is this in do I

rise lift in hydro cream and this is

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.520 
rise lift in hydro cream and this is
essentially<00:04:19.299> an<00:04:19.570> eye<00:04:19.720> cream<00:04:20.020> that<00:04:20.049> just<00:04:20.380> goes

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
this at night time and with this sample

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.830 
this at night time and with this sample
you<00:04:23.950> get<00:04:24.130> five<00:04:24.340> mils<00:04:24.640> but<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.000> regular<00:04:25.450> one<00:04:25.630> is

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
you get five mils but the regular one is

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.220 
you get five mils but the regular one is
15<00:04:26.290> mils<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.890> costs<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.600> 6720<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:28.990> again

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
15 mils and it costs you 6720 so again

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.290 
15 mils and it costs you 6720 so again
going<00:04:29.440> by<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.800> scale<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.580> price<00:04:30.910> this<00:04:30.940> is

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
going by the scale of this price this is

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.670 
going by the scale of this price this is
the<00:04:31.419> third<00:04:31.600> of<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.810> size<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.260> third<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
the third of the size so I third of the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.200 
the third of the size so I third of the
price<00:04:32.830> would<00:04:33.130> cost<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.520> around<00:04:33.610> twenty

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
price would cost you around twenty

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.030 
price would cost you around twenty
dollars<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:34.810> twenty<00:04:35.140> dollars<00:04:35.410> for<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:35.680> again

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
dollars so twenty dollars for this again

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.890 
dollars so twenty dollars for this again

as<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.550> picked<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:21.820> up<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.180> just<00:05:22.210> went<00:05:22.570> to

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
as I picked it up it just went to

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.360 
as I picked it up it just went to
complete<00:05:23.050> dust<00:05:23.320> all<00:05:23.560> in<00:05:23.710> my<00:05:23.830> hand<00:05:24.070> so

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
complete dust all in my hand so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.770 
complete dust all in my hand so
unfortunately<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.880> couldn't<00:05:25.150> use<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.390> but

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
unfortunately I couldn't use that but

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.900 
unfortunately I couldn't use that but
the<00:05:25.900> regular<00:05:26.260> price<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.680> this<00:05:26.830> was<00:05:27.070> $12<00:05:27.700> and

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
the regular price of this was $12 and

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.000 
the regular price of this was $12 and
the<00:05:28.450> sample<00:05:28.810> itself<00:05:28.930> was<00:05:29.229> quite<00:05:29.380> large<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.890> was

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
the sample itself was quite large it was

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.469 
the sample itself was quite large it was
roughly<00:05:30.250> about<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.700> big<00:05:30.910> so<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.240> don't

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
roughly about that big so I don't

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.880 
roughly about that big so I don't
imagine<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.900> was<00:05:31.960> much<00:05:32.169> smaller<00:05:32.440> than<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
imagine it was much smaller than the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.200 
imagine it was much smaller than the
full<00:05:33.070> size<00:05:33.280> but<00:05:33.520> like<00:05:33.669> i<00:05:33.790> said<00:05:33.820> it's

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
full size but like i said it's

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.700 
full size but like i said it's
completely<00:05:34.750> broken<00:05:34.780> so<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.380> literally

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
completely broken so I literally

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.040 
completely broken so I literally
couldn't<00:05:36.040> use<00:05:36.280> it<00:05:36.310> so<00:05:36.780> unfortunately<00:05:37.780> that's

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
couldn't use it so unfortunately that's

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.420 
couldn't use it so unfortunately that's
my<00:05:38.200> only<00:05:38.410> bad<00:05:38.650> experience<00:05:39.160> with<00:05:39.280> these

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
my only bad experience with these

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.980 
my only bad experience with these
month's<00:05:39.760> box<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.360> just<00:05:40.540> means<00:05:40.660> that<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:40.870> get

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
month's box and it just means that I get

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.360 
month's box and it just means that I get
to<00:05:41.050> miss<00:05:41.290> out<00:05:41.440> on<00:05:41.590> that<00:05:41.710> one<00:05:41.860> which<00:05:42.040> I'm<00:05:42.190> kind

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
to miss out on that one which I'm kind

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.860 
to miss out on that one which I'm kind
of<00:05:42.400> disappointed<00:05:42.700> by<00:05:43.180> but<00:05:43.479> there's<00:05:43.630> not<00:05:43.720> much

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
of disappointed by but there's not much

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.630 
of disappointed by but there's not much
I<00:05:43.990> can<00:05:44.050> do<00:05:44.290> because<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.950> looks<00:05:45.130> like<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.400> was<00:05:45.520> the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
I can do because it looks like I was the

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.159 
I can do because it looks like I was the
only<00:05:45.790> person<00:05:45.970> that<00:05:46.300> had<00:05:46.419> happened<00:05:46.540> to<00:05:46.870> but

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
only person that had happened to but

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.960 
only person that had happened to but
there<00:05:47.320> was<00:05:47.470> one<00:05:47.500> last<00:05:47.830> thing<00:05:48.100> in<00:05:48.280> this<00:05:48.430> box<00:05:48.669> on

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
there was one last thing in this box on

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.240 
there was one last thing in this box on
the<00:05:49.090> bottom<00:05:49.210> we<00:05:49.540> had<00:05:49.780> this<00:05:49.930> little<00:05:49.990> car<00:05:50.979> here

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
the bottom we had this little car here

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.100 
the bottom we had this little car here
which<00:05:51.400> I<00:05:51.520> wasn't<00:05:51.790> sure<00:05:51.910> what<00:05:52.120> it<00:05:52.180> was<00:05:52.270> so<00:05:52.930> on

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
which I wasn't sure what it was so on

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.260 
which I wasn't sure what it was so on
the<00:05:53.200> front<00:05:53.470> it<00:05:53.620> has<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.100> nearly<00:05:54.430> naked<00:05:54.640> Revlon

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
the front it has the nearly naked Revlon

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.420 
the front it has the nearly naked Revlon
make<00:05:55.479> up<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:55.960> campaign<00:05:56.470> and<00:05:56.680> everything<00:05:57.040> but

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
make up the campaign and everything but

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.740 
make up the campaign and everything but
when<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.669> turn<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:58.000> on<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.240> back<00:05:58.419> you<00:05:58.630> get

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
when you turn it on the back you get

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.810 
when you turn it on the back you get
four<00:05:58.990> samples<00:05:59.500> of<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.740> product<00:06:00.100> so<00:06:00.430> anomaly

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
four samples of the product so anomaly

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.280 
four samples of the product so anomaly
with<00:06:01.000> these<00:06:01.180> simple<00:06:01.360> cards<00:06:01.840> they<00:06:01.960> normally

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
with these simple cards they normally

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.630 
with these simple cards they normally
only<00:06:02.380> give<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:02.740> one<00:06:02.950> color<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.430> it's

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
only give you one color and it's

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.100 
only give you one color and it's
literally<00:06:03.880> bad<00:06:04.150> luck<00:06:04.390> if<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.690> doesn't<00:06:04.960> suit

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
literally bad luck if it doesn't suit

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.110 
literally bad luck if it doesn't suit
you<00:06:05.290> so<00:06:05.530> with<00:06:05.860> this<00:06:06.010> one<00:06:06.250> you<00:06:06.280> get<00:06:06.580> four<00:06:06.790> colors

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
you so with this one you get four colors

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.580 
you so with this one you get four colors
to<00:06:07.210> choose<00:06:07.390> from<00:06:07.450> so<00:06:07.660> you<00:06:07.840> can<00:06:07.990> actually<00:06:08.169> match

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
to choose from so you can actually match

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.290 
to choose from so you can actually match
it<00:06:08.800> to<00:06:08.830> your<00:06:08.979> skin<00:06:09.340> tone<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:09.760> figure<00:06:10.000> out<00:06:10.060> what

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
it to your skin tone and figure out what

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.730 
it to your skin tone and figure out what
color<00:06:10.540> you<00:06:10.750> need<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.169> thought<00:06:11.410> this<00:06:11.560> was

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
color you need I thought this was

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.530 
color you need I thought this was
awesome<00:06:12.160> I've<00:06:12.310> never<00:06:12.460> used<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.030> nearly<00:06:13.300> naked

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
awesome I've never used the nearly naked

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.690 
awesome I've never used the nearly naked
foundation<00:06:13.720> so<00:06:14.380> I'll<00:06:14.470> see<00:06:14.650> how<00:06:14.800> this<00:06:14.950> goes<00:06:15.160> but

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
foundation so I'll see how this goes but

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.460 
foundation so I'll see how this goes but
like<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.000> said<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.419> was<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.600> last<00:06:16.960> thing<00:06:17.229> in

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
like I said that was the last thing in

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.290 
like I said that was the last thing in
the<00:06:17.560> box<00:06:17.740> so<00:06:17.950> that<00:06:17.979> was<00:06:18.310> what<00:06:18.520> was<00:06:18.640> in<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:19.030> box

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
the box so that was what was in the box

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.570 
the box so that was what was in the box
for<00:06:19.479> April<00:06:19.870> so<00:06:20.140> as<00:06:20.470> this<00:06:20.650> is<00:06:20.830> my<00:06:21.010> first<00:06:21.310> box

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
I've had a pretty good impression with

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.020 
I've had a pretty good impression with
them<00:06:23.200> they<00:06:23.380> only<00:06:23.560> talk<00:06:23.919> about<00:06:24.190> a<00:06:24.370> week<00:06:24.850> I

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
them they only talk about a week I

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.640 
them they only talk about a week I
believe<00:06:25.360> to<00:06:25.390> ship<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:25.900> out<00:06:25.990> after<00:06:26.229> I<00:06:26.410> ordered

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
believe to ship it out after I ordered

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.680 
believe to ship it out after I ordered
it<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:26.979> my<00:06:27.280> only<00:06:27.460> issue<00:06:27.700> with<00:06:27.910> it<00:06:28.180> is<00:06:28.300> that<00:06:28.360> the

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
it and my only issue with it is that the

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.399 
it and my only issue with it is that the
eyeshadow<00:06:29.140> break<00:06:29.409> which<00:06:29.620> honest<00:06:29.919> I<00:06:30.010> don't

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409 
eyeshadow break which honest I don't

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:31.809 
eyeshadow break which honest I don't
think<00:06:30.529> I<00:06:30.589> can<00:06:30.739> really<00:06:30.919> blame<00:06:31.159> them<00:06:31.219> it<00:06:31.550> sounds

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
think I can really blame them it sounds

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.519 
think I can really blame them it sounds
like<00:06:31.909> it<00:06:32.089> just<00:06:32.269> happened<00:06:32.330> in<00:06:32.719> shipment<00:06:33.199> but<00:06:33.439> as

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
like it just happened in shipment but as

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:34.570 
like it just happened in shipment but as
for<00:06:33.739> the<00:06:33.889> other<00:06:34.039> products<00:06:34.429> there's

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
for the other products there's

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.699 
for the other products there's
definitely<00:06:34.939> way<00:06:35.300> more<00:06:35.330> value<00:06:35.989> in<00:06:36.229> this<00:06:36.439> box

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:36.709 
definitely way more value in this box

because i think it would be a really
good<00:06:46.729> idea<00:06:46.939> for<00:06:47.449> a<00:06:47.479> Mother's<00:06:48.019> Day<00:06:48.050> present<00:06:48.169> so
