00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
so I'm gonna be testing it out today a

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.840 
so I'm gonna be testing it out today a
couple<00:00:32.689> of<00:00:32.750> people<00:00:32.989> have<00:00:33.110> asked<00:00:33.350> me<00:00:33.469> to<00:00:33.590> do<00:00:33.739> a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
couple of people have asked me to do a

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.029 
couple of people have asked me to do a
little<00:00:34.850> video<00:00:35.059> on<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.570> Ruger<00:00:35.870> 10/22<00:00:36.140> and

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
little video on the Ruger 10/22 and

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.009 
little video on the Ruger 10/22 and
because<00:00:37.579> I<00:00:37.700> mentioned<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.239> other<00:00:38.390> videos<00:00:38.809> that

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
because I mentioned in other videos that

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.470 
because I mentioned in other videos that
I'm<00:00:39.140> not<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:39.499> huge<00:00:40.039> fan<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.059> I<00:00:41.089> would<00:00:41.269> like<00:00:41.449> to

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
I'm not a huge fan and I would like to

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.139 
I'm not a huge fan and I would like to
say<00:00:41.719> first<00:00:42.019> off<00:00:42.230> that's<00:00:42.499> not<00:00:43.070> because<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:44.089> think

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
say first off that's not because I think

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.889 
say first off that's not because I think
the<00:00:44.480> gun<00:00:44.659> is<00:00:45.489> bad<00:00:46.489> in<00:00:46.850> any<00:00:47.030> way<00:00:47.269> it's<00:00:47.569> merely

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
the gun is bad in any way it's merely

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.219 
the gun is bad in any way it's merely
that<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:48.230> have<00:00:48.530> never<00:00:49.010> really<00:00:49.579> cared<00:00:49.940> for

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
that I have never really cared for

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.660 
that I have never really cared for
semi-automatic<00:00:51.229> 22<00:00:51.739> some<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.339> them<00:00:52.429> just

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
semi-automatic 22 some of them just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.180 
semi-automatic 22 some of them just
don't<00:00:52.789> function<00:00:53.329> right<00:00:53.539> with<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:53.949> cheaper<00:00:54.949> ammo

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
don't function right with a cheaper ammo

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.369 
don't function right with a cheaper ammo
like<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.729> Walmart<00:00:55.940> brand<00:00:56.329> Ruger<00:00:57.140> 10/22

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
like the Walmart brand Ruger 10/22

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.739 
like the Walmart brand Ruger 10/22
always<00:00:58.249> functions<00:00:58.760> with<00:00:58.940> whatever<00:00:59.149> ammo<00:00:59.690> you

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
always functions with whatever ammo you

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.959 
always functions with whatever ammo you
put<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.109> it<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:00.409> just<00:01:01.280> because<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.639> have<00:01:01.729> never

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
put in it but just because I have never

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.289 
put in it but just because I have never
found<00:01:02.269> need<00:01:02.719> for<00:01:03.139> a<00:01:03.170> semi-automatic<00:01:03.949> 22<00:01:04.580> now

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
found need for a semi-automatic 22 now

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.730 
found need for a semi-automatic 22 now
today<00:01:05.630> I've<00:01:05.750> only<00:01:05.930> got<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.229> plastic

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
today I've only got the plastic

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.520 
today I've only got the plastic
magazines<00:01:07.190> that<00:01:07.340> couldn't<00:01:07.610> find<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.530> metal

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
magazines that couldn't find the metal

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.180 
magazines that couldn't find the metal
one<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:11.300> original<00:01:11.750> use<00:01:12.440> these<00:01:12.590> crappy<00:01:13.010> ones

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
one the original use these crappy ones

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.850 
one the original use these crappy ones
but<00:01:13.460> they<00:01:13.940> function<00:01:14.360> fine<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.020> let's<00:01:15.290> just<00:01:15.740> go

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
but they function fine so let's just go

00:01:15.860 --> 00:02:12.460 
but they function fine so let's just go
ahead<00:01:15.980> and<00:01:16.130> see<00:01:16.460> how<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.820> shoots

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.510 

that's<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> bad<00:02:15.030> roofing

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
that's actually it's not a bad roofing

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.540 
that's actually it's not a bad roofing
it's<00:02:17.520> definitely<00:02:18.060> high<00:02:18.330> left<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.400> I'll<00:02:20.400> see

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
it's definitely high left but I'll see

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.570 
it's definitely high left but I'll see
if<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.940> correct<00:02:21.209> them<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.459> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
if I can correct them now the one and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
if I can correct them now the one and
only<00:02:23.670> advantage<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.510> guy<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.380> banana<00:02:26.370> pit<00:02:29.600> so

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
only advantage this guy is banana pit so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.360 
only advantage this guy is banana pit so
it's<00:02:31.440> good<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.620> training<00:02:32.190> for

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
it's good for training for

00:02:32.370 --> 00:03:02.140 
it's good for training for
semi-automatics

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.600

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
let me see what this compares to it I'm

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.340 
let me see what this compares to it I'm
also<00:03:26.130> gonna<00:03:26.340> shoot<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.820> just<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.330> make<00:03:28.290> sure

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350

also gonna shoot that just to make sure
and<00:03:29.510> give<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.630> comparison<00:03:31.170> so

together pretty good all right now we'll

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.350 
together pretty good all right now we'll
give<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.410> Mossberg<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.010> shot<00:04:05.250> targets<00:04:06.060> out<00:04:06.210> the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
give the Mossberg a shot targets out the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.050 
give the Mossberg a shot targets out the
same<00:04:06.570> distance<00:04:07.020> hundred<00:04:07.410> yards<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.060> we'll

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
same distance hundred yards and we'll

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.790 
same distance hundred yards and we'll
see<00:04:09.270> what<00:04:09.720> kind<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.960> grouping<00:04:10.260> we<00:04:10.440> get<00:04:10.620> with

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
see what kind of grouping we get with

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:43.780 
see what kind of grouping we get with
this<00:04:10.950> compared<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.550> over<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.120> 1020

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.490 

and<00:04:44.790> this<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.660> group<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.050> got<00:04:46.260> with<00:04:46.470> my

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
and this is the group I got with my

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.920 
and this is the group I got with my
Mossberg<00:04:47.160> 46<00:04:47.820> out<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.360> bad

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
Mossberg 46 out not bad

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.610 
Mossberg 46 out not bad
so<00:04:49.590> they<00:04:49.740> both<00:04:49.920> perform<00:04:50.430> pretty<00:04:51.060> well<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.690> think

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
so they both perform pretty well I think

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.590 
so they both perform pretty well I think
my<00:04:53.210> Mossberg<00:04:54.210> was<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.450> little<00:04:54.750> tighter<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:56.600> not

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
my Mossberg was a little tighter but not

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.990 
my Mossberg was a little tighter but not
bad<00:04:58.640> especially<00:04:59.640> for<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.330> range<00:05:00.570> we're<00:05:00.870> at
