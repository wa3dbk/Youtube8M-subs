00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.249
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.069
 I waited for the regatta for the day but waited once 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.869
 so get the video yes but not really 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.909
 long but today i will try to do 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.979
 two and maybe she will come out right here 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.470
 now soon so don't forget 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:34.440
 check the channel and yes i will now 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 make a video both on the tundra and on gwt 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
 scarecrow those will develop from my 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 personal account and thanks guys from 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.780
 recession and if they suddenly go out 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.470
 some new tanks then maybe they 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.660
 I will ask 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.410
 and on a high level I will ask too 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.320
 them data tanks overlook or abbas 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 well, you understand what I mean so let's not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.880
 let us talk about the sad ssargot I am nowhere 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 get rid of the account is a press account and 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.250
 so it will be necessary so try to get 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.039
 him again well and if not if me 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.990
 support if I can without you and you 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.420
 believe it then like it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.039
 video and all the next video while in this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.869
 i will be very happy and 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.609
 see that really supports me and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.409
 Thank you for not having dispersed 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:22.289
 well now today we have at-1 and 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.719
 then and then the secret okay at1 what kind of 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.090
 such a machine is a 2 level machine 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.009
 Fri-shka Soviet with what actually all 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.170
 she starts wonderful she 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.359
 gorgeous she really likes me 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.149
 let her not so much armor 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.009
 punch and and all yes frankly in 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.799
 there is no armor, but we have 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.950
 magnificent tools 2 to choose one 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.149
 more accurate 57mm 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.429
 accurate gun with good speed 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.130
 breaking through and there is a high-explosive weapon 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.889
 seventy six millimeter and here it is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.539
 then I in this fight and put the next 

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:56.219
 I will probably make out of fifty seven 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.450
 millimeter cannon if you want something 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.990
 again write about it in 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.149
 comments 76 millimeter cannon than 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.219
 good when you take bombs on it 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.770
 first you forget about such as 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.110
 concept of how not to pierce and secondly she 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.530
 deals but in really serious damage and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 one-time damage 283 units and edit and 42 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.630
 a millimeter of this is enough to the most 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.370
 difficult opponents for us are 18 baths 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.530
 us if not vanshot very strong 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.780
 maimed but in principle we do with them 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.540
 that's why that's the only thing that decides here 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.820
 your skill is not as fast as the machine 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.340
 t18 to my great regret 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.520
 and probably not yours 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.680
 bad dynamics we maximal 30 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.600
 kilometers it still all right plus it 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.370
 Well, at least somehow unfolds 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.070
 you are unlikely to succeed unless of course 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.380
 the enemy is not on t3 in general for this 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.570
 machine especially rassusolivat nothing else 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.330
 at the second level it is if not imba then 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.100
 anyway interesting machine i am her 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.110
 left in his hangar no regrets 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.970
 on it regularly roll out the way to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.400
 recharge almost five seconds on this 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.010
 guns accuracy so terrifying 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.380
 but if you really get it then it's like a storm 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.020
 tiger is so low in general 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.190
 roll if you want to pump over 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.900
 branch to the end of its branch to 206 268 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.700
 I ask you to forgive, she is wonderful and so 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.590
 at-1 we basically explored 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.049
 the main tactic on her is to hold on 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.030
 of course behind allies in no way 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.620
 the case on it can not climb forward like me 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.540
 already and said booking here 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.590
 actually missing this one done 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.510
 machine based on the wedge t-26 literally in 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.070
 the literal sense of the word tower removed 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.780
 slightly corpus edited 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.690
 put another weapon and here you 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.760
 got so stay behind everyone 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 good battles fleeting in and most likely 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.930
 if your allies go quickly ahead 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.220
 you will stand behind them and 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.320
 shoot yourself frags 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.299
 Well this is you do nothing prevents units 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.080
 forgive just the opposite support you in 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.540
 this endeavor 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.489
 Well, thank you all for watching wait 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.900
 next video and bye bye see you 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.900
 soon on the battlefield
