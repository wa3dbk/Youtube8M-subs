and<00:00:17.410> away<00:00:17.710> it<00:00:18.010> goes<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.930> use<00:00:20.080> it<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.320> clear<00:00:20.530> the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
and away it goes we use it to clear the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.340 
and away it goes we use it to clear the
range<00:00:20.860> before<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.580> gun<00:00:21.730> shoot<00:00:21.970> so<00:00:22.540> you<00:00:23.260> know

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
range before the gun shoot so you know

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.840 
range before the gun shoot so you know
we<00:00:23.470> can<00:00:23.650> look<00:00:23.800> out<00:00:23.980> you<00:00:24.160> can<00:00:24.310> obviously<00:00:24.610> get

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
we can look out you can obviously get

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.370 
we can look out you can obviously get
height<00:00:25.120> and<00:00:25.330> look<00:00:25.480> out<00:00:25.630> farther<00:00:25.960> than<00:00:26.140> you

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
height and look out farther than you

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.500 
height and look out farther than you
would<00:00:26.500> be<00:00:26.620> able<00:00:26.860> to<00:00:27.010> with<00:00:27.190> say<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:27.940> CC<00:00:28.270> clear

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
would be able to with say the CC clear

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.810 
would be able to with say the CC clear
that<00:00:28.720> we<00:00:28.810> also<00:00:28.960> use<00:00:29.260> on<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.470> boat<00:00:29.650> which<00:00:30.610> has

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
that we also use on the boat which has

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.700 
that we also use on the boat which has
similar<00:00:31.210> capability<00:00:31.930> as<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.170> camera<00:00:32.470> on<00:00:32.619> the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
similar capability as the camera on the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.430 
similar capability as the camera on the
Primo<00:00:33.040> but<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.480> obviously<00:00:34.630> doesn't<00:00:35.110> have<00:00:35.260> the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
Primo but it obviously doesn't have the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.720 
Primo but it obviously doesn't have the
height<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.860> Puma<00:00:36.130> can<00:00:36.280> get<00:00:36.430> because<00:00:36.610> it

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
height of the Puma can get because it

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.460 
height of the Puma can get because it
implies<00:00:38.880> it's<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:40.000> great<00:00:40.210> capability<00:00:40.470> it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
implies it's a great capability it's

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.230 
implies it's a great capability it's
definitely<00:00:41.920> helped<00:00:42.430> us<00:00:42.550> out<00:00:42.730> with<00:00:42.790> don't

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
definitely helped us out with don't

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.760 
definitely helped us out with don't
clear<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.570> range<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:44.020> I<00:00:44.110> mean<00:00:44.260> if<00:00:44.470> you're<00:00:44.650> in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
clear the range and I mean if you're in

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.440 
clear the range and I mean if you're in
a<00:00:44.829> riverine<00:00:45.130> environment<00:00:45.700> which<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.030> where<00:00:46.240> we

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
a riverine environment which is where we

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.740 
a riverine environment which is where we
started<00:00:46.960> out<00:00:47.050> at<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.579> great<00:00:48.820> -<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.300> can<00:00:49.480> see

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
started out at it's great - you can see

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.660 
started out at it's great - you can see
down<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.050> bands<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.680> you<00:00:51.010> know<00:00:51.100> see<00:00:51.340> who's<00:00:51.520> on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
down the bands and you know see who's on

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.840

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
laptop where we're actually able to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.650 
laptop where we're actually able to
track<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.890> on<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> map<00:01:06.430> or<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.700> chart<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.390> is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
track it on a map or a chart that is

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.480 
track it on a map or a chart that is
loaded<00:01:07.960> up<00:01:08.200> onto<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.590> laptop<00:01:08.770> through<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.280> hard

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
loaded up onto the laptop through a hard

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.260 
loaded up onto the laptop through a hard
drive<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.500> we<00:01:11.620> can<00:01:11.740> see<00:01:11.910> data<00:01:12.910> around

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
drive and so we can see data around

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.910 
drive and so we can see data around
what's<00:01:13.570> going<00:01:13.780> on<00:01:13.870> and<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.110> can<00:01:14.140> we<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.710> watch

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
what's going on and we can we can watch

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.610 
what's going on and we can we can watch
the<00:01:15.130> Puma<00:01:15.940> has<00:01:16.150> applause<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:17.230> always<00:01:17.440> have

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
the Puma has applause we always have

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.590 
the Puma has applause we always have
grids<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.430> always<00:01:18.580> keep<00:01:19.120> an<00:01:19.240> eye<00:01:19.270> on<00:01:19.330> where

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
grids and we always keep an eye on where

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.690 
grids and we always keep an eye on where
it's<00:01:19.720> at<00:01:19.870> so<00:01:19.900> let<00:01:20.290> me<00:01:20.410> know<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:21.190> know<00:01:21.310> what

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
it's at so let me know you know what

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.430 
it's at so let me know you know what
direction<00:01:21.970> what<00:01:22.300> bearing<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.020> us

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
direction what bearing it is to us

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.990 
direction what bearing it is to us
so<00:01:23.590> for<00:01:23.890> where<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.100> go<00:01:24.220> down<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.430> one<00:01:24.790> kilometer

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
so for where to go down a one kilometer

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.390 
so for where to go down a one kilometer
away<00:01:25.420> we'd<00:01:25.750> be<00:01:25.870> able<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.229> track<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.890> down<00:01:27.010> and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
away we'd be able to track it down and

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.990 
away we'd be able to track it down and
find<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.760> should<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.390> over<00:01:28.690> here<00:01:28.720> somewhere

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200 

I'm<00:01:38.510> not<00:01:38.720> landed<00:01:39.080> yet<00:01:39.850> today<00:01:40.850> was<00:01:41.000> smooth
