thing that I think Pat Galvan deflation
is<00:04:03.130> after<00:04:03.610> he<00:04:03.670> was<00:04:03.790> very<00:04:03.940> similar<00:04:04.450> in<00:04:04.900> some

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
is after he was very similar in some

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.690 
is after he was very similar in some
ways<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.310> sense<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.760> we<00:04:07.209> constantly<00:04:08.019> see

ways in the sense that we constantly see
