weighed less and consumed fewer calories

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.729 
weighed less and consumed fewer calories
mainly<00:02:12.690> because<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:13.110> were<00:02:13.230> eating<00:02:13.560> little

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
mainly because they were eating little

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.830 
mainly because they were eating little
and<00:02:13.920> often<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.459> didn't<00:02:14.970> allow<00:02:15.090> themselves<00:02:15.450> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
eat it any one meal so my advice is to

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.420 
eat it any one meal so my advice is to
eat<00:02:21.300> little<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.690> often<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.349> your<00:02:22.770> body<00:02:23.010> craves

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
eat little and often as your body craves

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.940 
eat little and often as your body craves
it<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.540> not<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.959> pry<00:02:25.140> yourself<00:02:25.319> when<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
it and to not to pry yourself when you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.309 
it and to not to pry yourself when you
really<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.489> angry<00:02:26.970> myth<00:02:27.630> number<00:02:27.840> four<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
really are angry myth number four is

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.990 
really are angry myth number four is
that<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> have<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.920> read<00:02:29.069> super<00:02:29.459> foods<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> be

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.840 
that you have to read super foods to be
healthy<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.290> term<00:02:31.530> superfood<00:02:31.860> isn't

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
healthy so the term superfood isn't

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.880 
healthy so the term superfood isn't
actually<00:02:33.060> legal<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.080> there's<00:02:34.290> no<00:02:34.380> legal

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
actually legal so there's no legal
