I'm<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> fast-forward<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.479> here

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I'm just going to fast-forward it here

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.219 
I'm just going to fast-forward it here
now<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.470> also<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.450> quote<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.960> says

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
now it also in in in the quote it says

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
now it also in in in the quote it says
the<00:01:49.500> believers<00:01:50.070> number<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.880> Neil<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the believers number two Neil the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
the believers number two Neil the
believers<00:01:52.020> number<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.680> we've<00:01:53.490> always

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
believers number and we've always

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399 
believers number and we've always
thought<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.119> believers<00:01:54.509> number<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.960> seven

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
thought the believers number to be seven

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.950 
thought the believers number to be seven
so<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> each<00:01:56.310> crouched<00:01:56.670> seven<00:01:57.329> times<00:01:57.600> which

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
so we each crouched seven times which

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
so we each crouched seven times which
would<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.320> kneeling<00:01:58.829> seven<00:01:59.189> times<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> we

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
would be like kneeling seven times so we

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.749 
would be like kneeling seven times so we
did<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.350> mandatory

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
did that we don't know if it's mandatory

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.639 
did that we don't know if it's mandatory
but<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.909> did<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.149> now<00:02:03.570> after<00:02:03.719> sitting<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.350> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
but we did it now after sitting here for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.990 
but we did it now after sitting here for
about<00:02:04.710> two<00:02:05.490> minutes<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:07.320> happens

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.540 

for<00:02:11.000> gravity<00:02:11.420> ambers<00:02:11.920> now<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.160> would<00:02:13.340> that

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
for gravity ambers now that would that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.670 
for gravity ambers now that would that
would<00:02:13.610> go<00:02:13.880> along<00:02:14.000> with<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.810> quote<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.349> says

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
would go along with the quote that says

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.430 
would go along with the quote that says
smash<00:02:16.580> or<00:02:16.940> enemies<00:02:17.330> ATS<00:02:17.540> under<00:02:17.900> gravity

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
smash or enemies ATS under gravity

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.339 
smash or enemies ATS under gravity
hammering<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.099> used<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.459> smash<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.930> that's<00:02:21.200> all

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
hammering is used to smash so that's all

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.100

we<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:22.180> we're<00:02:23.180> not<00:02:23.300> really<00:02:23.540> sure<00:02:23.630> if<00:02:23.870> there's

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
we do we're not really sure if there's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.510 
we do we're not really sure if there's
anything<00:02:24.319> else<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:24.920> with<00:02:25.069> these<00:02:25.130> gravity

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
popped up that we saw and the gravity

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.729 
popped up that we saw and the gravity
hammers<00:02:32.510> are<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.870> drunk<00:02:33.020> normal<00:02:33.350> gravity
