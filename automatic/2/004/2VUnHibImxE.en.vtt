00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.540
 So the final 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.409
 Our Park In-bae player is playing 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.550
 Low 500m final clash 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.229
 After checking Astra's error, he's gone. 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 Goalkeeper position this time 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.200
 All three players inherit 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.950
 Drive Online 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 11 750 Yuan 100 - Asia 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.340
 Comedian in Japan 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 Winter is longer and I have position 3 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.340
 Leave pixels 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 I'll show you wit. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 Of course, if you lose to Star Trek 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.430
 I'm going to make an award 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 As a pre-sale information, 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.370
 Eun-ry won four consecutive wins 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 1 5. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 I think that I will not be selected. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.000
 Jindo 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Han Ji Hye 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.870
 Results of the Mokpo Daejeon-sized scale A whole university industry in Seoul a University China 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.980
 One player and the legal popularity -43 players 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 I had a 500m final match first. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 The situation like Kwak, Yun-gi is a bit confident 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.910
 That's it. 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.170
 A personal introduction 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.930
 It is anticipated that the life of the athlete is a little different from each other's position 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.320
 How to fight a fight to do it at home 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.550
 Because he was a witty guy who lost in the process 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.550
 So, as a year-old minority shareholder, 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 Now and a few years new players 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 Among the modern players 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.600
 'Himalayas 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 Let's go to the women table tennis team 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.080
 Started by start 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 Pyeongtaek Factory 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.099
 I became an office worker who had to start illegally twice in the industry. 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.799
 Netpia is the last of this market 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.699
 I was in position 5. 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.209
 Included in the question is the first sales to Lee Seo Jin after the sluggish sales 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.539
 Now on this 9th 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.329
 kt is the first player 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.519
 Because 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.519
 I did. 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.259
 I said the same thing. 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.369
 Jami only 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.319
 But 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.319
 Night Shamalan's Cancer 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.849
 Rather than being dependent on the child, 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.699
 Collapsed 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.299
 There was a situation 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.969
 Solve the problem 18 days a month 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.969
 I need to get Paekje loose. 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.249
 970202 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.999
 I'll do it. 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.400
 Now the fourth end now 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.589
 From my company 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.709
 Chinese players in this series of democracy 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.859
 Hanyang University Hospital, the rest of the court 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.499
 Not the first time, but I do. 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.569
 If you add up to receive all the children, 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.279
 The prospects came. 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.109
 In 2001, of course, 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.039
 Three or four times in the race 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.039
 I'm going to start over again. 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.049
 Now again, 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 We sell all three children because there are players 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.540
 According to Mr. b, 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.599
 My mother may have a chance to run for president next year. 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.599
 I'll make a lot of supplies. 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.039
 Do not admit 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.039
 I'll be back on the starting line. 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.490
 Daegu and Gyeongbuk went back a little better. 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.430
 My country is a rather existing player First principle 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.650
 There is departure 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.120
 It's a huge inside. 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.900
 I won. In this case, even for the paper, 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.900
 But always so with the host 

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:51.499
 Introduced technology from university 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.499
 But this is the final 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.839
 It is a competitive aspect. 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.589
 There is no obvious ground for 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.479
 It is not apart 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.639
 It's confirmed. 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.770
 Next month, the weekend drama 'Dae Jang Geum' 

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:19.579
 International 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:23.159
 In the second foreign exchange crisis 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.229
 Greed for the national team 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.220
 Have 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.610
 In preparation for the prosecution summons, the player scored first. 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.610
 We like our people. 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.189
 Final 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.189
 You can stay in comfort and be able to pack up to 2 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.099
 A lot of Park In-bae got a medal anyway, 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.489
 If you win a medal 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.169
 Representative of oil tanker company 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.169
 Because I signed it today and dropped out. 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:01.830
 KEPCO is the last 4. 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.830
 Korea Meteorological Administration 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.430
 Koreans themselves 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.050
 Second quarter player 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.589
 Declare an independent candidate 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.349
 Five players 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.430
 Without wood 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.430
 We have just launched in order. 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.779
 That's the kind of business that's happening, 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.779
 Outward. What do you do first? 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.479
 School Teachers and Language Teachers Union 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.860
 Korea is in the fourth quarter of the US 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.999
 Preparing for the prosecution 

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.999
 And Park In - bae finishes. 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:13.979
 Power house sales 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:17.919
 One more meal until late 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.180
 The people of Korea
