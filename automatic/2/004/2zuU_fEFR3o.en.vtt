majority of people do and no one uses
them<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:03.860> once<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.160> base<00:02:04.490> color<00:02:04.850> is

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
them and then once that base color is

and then once I've applied those to the
cheeks<00:04:38.040> then<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.640> think<00:04:39.240> for<00:04:39.450> lips<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.810> would

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
cheeks then I think for lips I would

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.290 
cheeks then I think for lips I would
actually<00:04:40.560> wear<00:04:40.800> this<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.730> if<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.000> was<00:04:42.120> wearing

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
actually wear this like if I was wearing

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.720 
actually wear this like if I was wearing
this<00:04:42.510> out<00:04:42.720> I'd<00:04:43.020> wear<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.590> with<00:04:43.830> red<00:04:44.040> lipstick

this out I'd wear this with red lipstick
but<00:04:45.720> I<00:04:45.750> wear<00:04:46.020> like<00:04:46.230> literally<00:04:46.620> anything<00:04:47.010> with
