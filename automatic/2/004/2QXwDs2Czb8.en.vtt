I'm going to twist the gray needle very

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
I'm going to twist the gray needle very
slightly<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.890> meet<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.579> black

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
slightly so that they meet the black

another<00:01:02.940> quarter<00:01:03.449> turn<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:05.729> could<00:01:05.909> have

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
another quarter turn it could have

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.219 
another quarter turn it could have
turned<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> other<00:01:06.659> way

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
turned the other way

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.789 
turned the other way
twist<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.920> gently<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.850> meet<00:01:09.119> nicely

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
twist it gently so that they meet nicely

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.120

yes<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:13.130> turn<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.340> either<00:01:14.520> direction

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
yes you can turn in either direction

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.539 
yes you can turn in either direction
when<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.840> connection<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.409> made<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.310> may

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
when they the connection is made you may

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.719 
when they the connection is made you may
feel<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.780> hear<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.580> connection

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.090 

it<00:01:30.329> should<00:01:30.570> take<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:31.110> effort<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:32.039> not

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it should take a little effort but not

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760

too<00:01:32.610> much<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> find<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> connection<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
too much if you find the connection is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.999 
too much if you find the connection is
difficult<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.729> I'll<00:01:36.000> show<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> two<00:01:36.719> ways

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
difficult to make I'll show you two ways

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.749 
difficult to make I'll show you two ways
that<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.280> might<00:01:38.969> find<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.229> easier<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:41.369> are

may not even need it on the needle but
I'll<00:02:03.229> use<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.880> trouble

like that rather I'm leaving roughly

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.190 
like that rather I'm leaving roughly
half<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.130> paperclip<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.120> one<00:03:00.750> side<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.019> the

side<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.000> cord<00:03:03.329> I've<00:03:03.450> made<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> nice<00:03:05.750> close

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
side of the cord I've made a nice close

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.849 
side of the cord I've made a nice close
connection<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.760> now<00:03:09.359> it's<00:03:10.079> really

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
connection there and now it's really

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.819 
connection there and now it's really
even<00:03:11.459> easier<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:11.910> me<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.420> turn<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.380> court<00:03:13.680> I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
even easier for me to turn the court I

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.259 
even easier for me to turn the court I
have<00:03:14.099> this<00:03:14.370> paperclip<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> kind<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.019> key<00:03:17.269> the

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
have this paperclip is a kind of key the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.210 
have this paperclip is a kind of key the
same<00:03:18.540> connecting<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.290> mechanism<00:03:19.799> works<00:03:20.010> on
