00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.010
this is very very important stirling engine
and this one has been designed by subir bhaduri.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.120
you can see there is a little wooden stand,
and these are the various parts of the stirling

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.859
engine. this is the box stand on which this
engine will be mounted. you can see a vertical

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.859
screw and on this screw you screw in the nut
on which there is a heat sink. this heat sink

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.519
has got a central bore. right side is where
you will put in the lamp. and then you take

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.620
the flywheel and crank rod and you screw it
in the heat sink. this is the crank part.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.340
then you take a connecting rod and screw it
to the crank and you just let it hang around.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.840
then you take the long piston and there is
a small displacer which is made from m-seal.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.989
you put this long tube in the bore of the
heat sink. then lift the crank rod and put

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.640
it in the displacer. we need another crank.
there is another crank which is phased out

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.070
at 90 degrees and now you connect the crank
rod to the long tube. finally you take the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.320
flywheel and tighten the screw of the flywheel
to the axle so it is solidly connected to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.950
it. now the stirling engine is almost assembled.
you have got to ensure that the displacer

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.950
and the piston rotate smoothly. you need to
oil them. finally take a spirit lamp and heat

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.759
the right rod. red part is actually ceramic
to insulate. then you kick start the flywheel

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.710
and you will be surprised that this engine
keeps rotating. it will keep rotating till

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.470
the fuel lasts. its a heat engine and quite
a beauty to behold. you can see the con rods,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.650
cranks and the flywheel in motion.
