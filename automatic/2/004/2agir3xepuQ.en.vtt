00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
We recycle all the scraps of bicycles

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.500
and we transform them into Bicimáquinas (bicycle machines)

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Everyday people believe more in Bicimáquinas

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
without any advertising

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
because the result speaks for itself

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.700
Not using electricity

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
not using fuel

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that degrades our environment

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
this is the success of our organization

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Degraining 500 kilos

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or 5 bags of 45 kilos each day was difficult

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.500
from that the idea of the Bicidesgranadora (degrainer) was born

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Water is really important to us

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.300
we use it for drinking, for washing and all the rest

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
here we don't have drinkable water

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
with this water we live

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
First we cut the Aloe

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then we take off the skin

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we cut it into little pieces

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and we put it in the blender of the Bicilicuadora

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and we pedal!

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:30.449
it makes the hair fresh and straight

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this is the prepared shampoo

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
They come from many countries

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500
they arrive from the USA, France, Italy… 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
they're kind and nice people

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Maya Pedal is the Maya Pedal Family

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because here people from all over the world meet

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we share our experience

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and together we improve the Bicimáquinas

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Everybody can visit us

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
