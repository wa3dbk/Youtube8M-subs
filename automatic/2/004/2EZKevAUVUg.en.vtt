four seventy millimeter deep right above

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
four seventy millimeter deep right above
we<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> power<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.309> reset<00:00:59.820> switch<00:01:00.270> audio

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we get the power and reset switch audio

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.830 
we get the power and reset switch audio

unfortunately<00:01:06.840> there's<00:01:07.320> no<00:01:07.560> ventilation<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
unfortunately there's no ventilation on

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.789 
unfortunately there's no ventilation on
the<00:01:08.729> top<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.780> probably<00:01:10.049> end<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.590> with

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the top so you will probably end up with

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.700 
the top so you will probably end up with
just<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.100> outtake<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.200> fine

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
just one outtake but for me that's fine

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
just one outtake but for me that's fine
because<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.700> an<00:01:14.909> entry-level<00:01:15.360> case

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
because this is just an entry-level case

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.140 
because this is just an entry-level case
there's<00:01:16.650> no<00:01:16.890> need<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.189> put<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> lot<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> powerful

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
there's no need to put a lot of powerful

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.969 
there's no need to put a lot of powerful
stops<00:01:18.659> inside<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.590> cook<00:01:19.830> your
