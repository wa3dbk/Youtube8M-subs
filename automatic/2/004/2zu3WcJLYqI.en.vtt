00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
a few now a little and a few a little

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.649 
a few now a little and a few a little
they<00:02:30.159> tend<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.459> take<00:02:30.639> the<00:02:30.819> meaning<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.329> small

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
they tend to take the meaning of a small

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.500 
they tend to take the meaning of a small
number<00:02:31.989> but<00:02:32.379> it's<00:02:33.129> enough<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.879> sufficient

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
number but it's enough it's a sufficient

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.750 
number but it's enough it's a sufficient
amount<00:02:34.629> so<00:02:35.469> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.799> say<00:02:35.980> let's<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.519> get<00:02:36.700> a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
