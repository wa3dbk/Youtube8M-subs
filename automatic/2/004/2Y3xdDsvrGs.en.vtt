generally your best bet when it comes to
attacking<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> legs<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.430> legs<00:00:32.640> are

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
attacking the legs are your legs are

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.190 
attacking the legs are your legs are
your<00:00:33.000> base<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> good<00:00:33.989> base

when you work out your legs want to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.500 
when you work out your legs want to
remember<00:01:05.379> basically<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.820> just<00:01:07.090> like<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
remember basically that just like the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.120 
remember basically that just like the
upper<00:01:07.720> body<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.080> want<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.290> focus<00:01:08.440> on<00:01:08.710> control

people<00:01:13.390> have<00:01:13.630> more<00:01:14.460> chemistry<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:17.229> muscle

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
people have more chemistry and my muscle

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.960 
people have more chemistry and my muscle
connection<00:01:17.800> with<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.160> muscles<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.910> are

connection with the muscles that are

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.060

closer<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.540> heart<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:20.050> know<00:01:20.560> I've<00:01:20.800> been<00:01:20.830> one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
closer to the heart I know I've been one

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.950 
closer to the heart I know I've been one
of<00:01:21.100> those<00:01:21.220> people<00:01:21.340> but<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.880> more<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.060> focus<00:01:22.479> on

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
of those people but the more I focus on

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.990 
of those people but the more I focus on
stimulating<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.740> muscle<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.640> actually

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
stimulating the muscle and actually

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.219 
stimulating the muscle and actually
breaking<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.360> down<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.690> working<00:01:25.960> into<00:01:26.080> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
breaking it down and working into the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.410 
breaking it down and working into the
max<00:01:26.470> holding<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.399> contraction<00:01:28.060> really

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
max holding the contraction really

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.210 
max holding the contraction really
controlling<00:01:28.899> my<00:01:28.990> contractions<00:01:29.470> more

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
controlling my contractions more

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.580 
controlling my contractions more
responsive<00:01:31.000> better<00:01:31.180> leg<00:01:32.020> development<00:01:32.500> I'm

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
responsive better leg development I'm

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.920 
responsive better leg development I'm
getting<00:01:32.910> it<00:01:33.910> comes<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.240> legs<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.630> think<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
getting it comes the legs I think the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.690 
getting it comes the legs I think the
trick<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.259> really<00:01:35.500> get<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.100> respond<00:01:36.520> and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
trick to really get it to respond and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.139 
trick to really get it to respond and
growth<00:01:36.910> is<00:01:37.570> uh<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:38.800> you<00:01:39.160> know<00:01:39.280> moderate<00:01:39.729> modern

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
growth is uh is you know moderate modern

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.930 
growth is uh is you know moderate modern
intensities<00:01:40.690> in<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.500> high<00:01:41.680> high<00:01:42.160> volumes<00:01:42.700> I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
intensities in and high high volumes I

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.420 
intensities in and high high volumes I
mean<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.149> used<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.390> be<00:01:43.509> one<00:01:43.660> of<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.840> low<00:01:44.020> rep

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
mean I used to be one of the low rep

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.920 
mean I used to be one of the low rep
heavy<00:01:45.430> heavyweight<00:01:45.970> guys<00:01:46.180> with<00:01:46.660> my<00:01:46.720> leg

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
heavy heavyweight guys with my leg

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.960 
heavy heavyweight guys with my leg
training<00:01:47.170> but<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.250> didn't<00:01:48.430> do<00:01:48.490> anything<00:01:48.670> but

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
training but that didn't do anything but

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.249 
training but that didn't do anything but
give<00:01:49.149> me<00:01:49.270> great<00:01:49.450> development<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.050> power

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
give me great development in the power

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.469 
give me great development in the power
of<00:01:50.380> muscles<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.220> posterior<00:01:51.640> chain<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.240> hams

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
of muscles the posterior chain the hams

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.840 
of muscles the posterior chain the hams
and<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.110> glutes<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:54.159> know<00:01:54.250> strong<00:01:54.520> as<00:01:54.729> all

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
and the glutes you know strong as all

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.000 
and the glutes you know strong as all
get-out<00:01:55.090> but<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:56.350> reason<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.680> quads

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
get-out but some reason the quads

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.399 
get-out but some reason the quads
generally<00:01:57.430> don't<00:01:57.580> respond<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.780> explosive

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
generally don't respond to the explosive

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.109 
generally don't respond to the explosive
or<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.740> power<00:01:59.950> train<00:02:00.310> if<00:02:00.490> they<00:02:00.610> respond<00:02:01.060> to

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
or the power train if they respond to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.080 
or the power train if they respond to
the<00:02:01.299> volume<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.650> mean<00:02:02.950> volume<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.759> modern

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the volume so I mean volume and modern

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.420 
the volume so I mean volume and modern
intensities<00:02:04.570> are<00:02:04.720> generally<00:02:05.049> your<00:02:05.979> best<00:02:06.220> bet

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
intensities are generally your best bet

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.710 
intensities are generally your best bet
when<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.729> comes<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.060> attacking<00:02:07.479> their<00:02:07.570> leg

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
when it comes to attacking their leg

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.900 
when it comes to attacking their leg
their<00:02:07.930> big<00:02:08.080> muscle<00:02:08.410> groups<00:02:08.530> they<00:02:09.399> used<00:02:09.610> to

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
their big muscle groups they used to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.280 
their big muscle groups they used to
have<00:02:10.090> great<00:02:10.360> endurance<00:02:10.690> because<00:02:10.899> used<00:02:11.170> to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
have great endurance because used to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.740 
have great endurance because used to
walking<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.830> them<00:02:11.980> all<00:02:12.130> day<00:02:12.160> they<00:02:13.090> take<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.510> lot

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
walking on them all day they take a lot

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.690 
walking on them all day they take a lot
to<00:02:13.780> break<00:02:14.049> down<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.709> that's<00:02:15.190> your<00:02:15.519> best

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
to break down so that's your best

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.729 
to break down so that's your best
approach<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.299> electric

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739

the reason our pre-exhaustion muscles to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.530 
the reason our pre-exhaustion muscles to
to<00:02:24.349> target<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.799> muscle<00:02:25.159> better<00:02:25.540> generally

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
to target the muscle better generally

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.300 
to target the muscle better generally
when<00:02:26.629> you<00:02:26.719> train<00:02:27.019> big<00:02:27.620> muscle<00:02:27.950> groups<00:02:28.040> like

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
when you train big muscle groups like

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.860 
when you train big muscle groups like
their<00:02:28.489> legs<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.030> whole<00:02:29.209> body<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.689> an

their legs the whole body is an

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.890 
their legs the whole body is an
emotional<00:02:30.680> working<00:02:31.099> so<00:02:31.760> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.239> can<00:02:32.599> get<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
emotional working so if you can get the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.530 
emotional working so if you can get the
blood<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.739> target<00:02:34.159> areas<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:35.060> kind<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.389> pre

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
blood in the target areas to kind of pre

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
fatigue those those muscle fibers then

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.899 
fatigue those those muscle fibers then
when<00:02:39.109> you<00:02:39.200> go<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.379> train<00:02:39.799> them<00:02:40.069> they'll<00:02:40.790> be

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
when you go to train them they'll be

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.390 
when you go to train them they'll be
working<00:02:41.269> harder<00:02:41.629> than<00:02:41.659> any<00:02:41.900> other<00:02:42.139> group<00:02:42.400> when

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
working harder than any other group when

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.369 
working harder than any other group when
I<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.549> walking<00:02:43.819> lunges<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.389> do<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.659> short<00:02:45.019> stroke

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
I do walking lunges I do a short stroke

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.369 
I do walking lunges I do a short stroke
lunch<00:02:45.849> generally<00:02:46.849> because<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.420> need<00:02:48.170> more

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
lunch generally because I need more

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
hamstring ability when it comes to it's

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.409 
hamstring ability when it comes to it's
all<00:02:53.870> about<00:02:54.049> balance<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.739> basically<00:02:55.519> these

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
all about balance it's basically these

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.879 
all about balance it's basically these
shorter<00:02:56.900> strokes<00:02:57.169> because<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.739> more

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
shorter strokes because you get more

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.710 
shorter strokes because you get more
quite<00:02:58.159> work<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> way<00:02:58.669> as<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.329> simple<00:02:59.450> as

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
quite work that way as it's as simple as

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440 
quite work that way as it's as simple as
that<00:02:59.750> as<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.739> can<00:03:00.829> see<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.010> get<00:03:01.189> more<00:03:01.370> reps<00:03:01.669> it's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
that as you can see I get more reps it's

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.629 
that as you can see I get more reps it's
more<00:03:02.689> of<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.810> punk<00:03:03.349> for<00:03:03.590> me<00:03:03.709> that's<00:03:04.310> why<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.489> use

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
more of a punk for me that's why I use

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.190 
more of a punk for me that's why I use
it<00:03:04.819> it's<00:03:05.090> kind<00:03:05.269> of<00:03:05.299> like<00:03:05.419> a<00:03:05.450> pre<00:03:05.689> exhausting<00:03:06.139> a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
it it's kind of like a pre exhausting a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:04:04.230 
it it's kind of like a pre exhausting a
woman

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:16.410 

I<00:04:13.950> use<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> single<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.520> leg<00:04:15.760> press<00:04:16.030> because

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
I use a single a leg press because

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.470 
I use a single a leg press because
basically<00:04:17.260> I'm<00:04:17.800> trained<00:04:18.640> about<00:04:18.850> myself<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.300> lot

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
basically I'm trained about myself a lot

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.479 
basically I'm trained about myself a lot
I<00:04:19.750> don't<00:04:20.380> feel<00:04:20.560> like<00:04:20.680> Lo<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:20.920> a<00:04:21.130> bunch<00:04:21.370> of

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
I don't feel like Lo and a bunch of

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.080 
I don't feel like Lo and a bunch of
place<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:22.750> know<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.200> on<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.830> off<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.370> figure

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
place you know and on and off I figure

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.970 
place you know and on and off I figure
if<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.240> use<00:04:25.420> one<00:04:25.630> leg<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:26.410> less<00:04:26.620> weight<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
if I use one leg it's less weight the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.980 
if I use one leg it's less weight the
load<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:28.090> get<00:04:28.360> down<00:04:28.570> with<00:04:28.690> more<00:04:28.780> work

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
load and I get down with more work

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.650 
load and I get down with more work
faster<00:04:29.560> also<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.430> helps<00:04:30.610> me<00:04:30.730> control<00:04:30.970> my<00:04:31.300> rest

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
faster also it helps me control my rest

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.450 
faster also it helps me control my rest
times<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:32.050> little<00:04:32.230> better<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:32.920> if<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.130> ever<00:04:33.310> do

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
times a little better but if you ever do

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.740 
times a little better but if you ever do
any<00:04:33.640> research<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.150> realize<00:04:34.420> when<00:04:34.630> you're

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
any research you realize when you're

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.360 
any research you realize when you're
working<00:04:35.050> one<00:04:35.230> leg<00:04:35.260> at<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.620> time<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.980> get<00:04:36.130> more

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
working one leg at a time to get more

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.640 
working one leg at a time to get more
muscle<00:04:36.940> recruitment<00:04:37.360> out<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.230> each<00:04:38.380> leg<00:04:43.650> well

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
muscle recruitment out of each leg well

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.560 
muscle recruitment out of each leg well
that<00:04:44.830> just<00:04:44.920> sounds<00:04:45.070> first<00:04:45.340> thing<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:45.820> was

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
that just sounds first thing and I was

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.180 
that just sounds first thing and I was
doing<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.840> group<00:04:46.930> glute<00:04:47.230> hammer<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.620> superset

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
doing the group glute hammer a superset

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.730 
doing the group glute hammer a superset
it<00:04:48.280> with<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.580> sissy<00:04:49.300> squat<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.900> know<00:04:50.470> some

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
it with the sissy squat I know some

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.140 
it with the sissy squat I know some
people<00:04:50.830> see<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.190> glute-ham<00:04:51.490> raise<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.910> hip

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
people see the glute-ham raise the hip

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.040 
people see the glute-ham raise the hip
version<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:53.140> is<00:04:53.200> more<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.740> the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
version this is more of the the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.540 
version this is more of the the
deflection<00:04:56.050> deflection<00:04:56.920> version<00:04:57.310> where<00:04:57.460> he

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
deflection deflection version where he

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.700 
deflection deflection version where he
needs<00:04:57.760> actually<00:04:58.150> going<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.500> pad

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
needs actually going on the on the pad

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.920 
needs actually going on the on the pad
and<00:04:59.950> actually<00:05:00.430> working<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:01.510> have<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.690> be<00:05:01.780> real

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
and actually working you have to be real

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.970 
and actually working you have to be real
careful<00:05:02.200> if<00:05:02.410> you've<00:05:02.500> never<00:05:02.590> done<00:05:02.830> these

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
careful if you've never done these

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.360 
careful if you've never done these
before

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
before

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.330 
before
I<00:05:03.640> suggest<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.420> warm<00:05:04.600> up<00:05:04.660> with<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> leg<00:05:05.110> press

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
I suggest you warm up with the leg press

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.740 
I suggest you warm up with the leg press
off<00:05:06.340> often<00:05:06.790> Dougie's<00:05:07.030> on<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.240> city<00:05:07.480> calf

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
off often Dougie's on the city calf

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.690 
off often Dougie's on the city calf
raise<00:05:07.990> facing<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.470> opposite<00:05:08.830> direction<00:05:08.890> so

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
raise facing the opposite direction so

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.160 
raise facing the opposite direction so
you're<00:05:09.850> closer<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.360> ground<00:05:10.630> so<00:05:10.960> if<00:05:11.050> you

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
you're closer to the ground so if you

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.170 
you're closer to the ground so if you
have<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.620> use<00:05:12.250> help<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.640> can<00:05:12.760> always<00:05:12.970> touch

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
train a lot of hamstrings where they

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.320 
train a lot of hamstrings where they
have<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.380> history<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.830> being<00:05:27.670> athletics<00:05:28.240> and

have a history of being athletics and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.180 
have a history of being athletics and
I've<00:05:28.510> worked<00:05:28.870> my<00:05:29.110> explosive<00:05:29.560> muscles<00:05:29.890> so<00:05:30.100> they

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
I've worked my explosive muscles so they

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.550 
I've worked my explosive muscles so they
respond<00:05:30.610> very<00:05:30.700> very<00:05:31.120> well<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:32.440> this

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
respond very very well but but this

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.250 
respond very very well but but this
movement<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:33.130> just<00:05:33.340> one<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.610> those<00:05:33.990> bang<00:05:34.990> for

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
movement is just one of those bang for

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.590 
movement is just one of those bang for
your<00:05:35.350> buck<00:05:35.530> movements<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.850> that's<00:05:37.180> why<00:05:37.330> I<00:05:37.360> use

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
your buck movements so that's why I use

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.330 
your buck movements so that's why I use
it<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:38.230> when<00:05:38.470> you<00:05:38.530> get<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.680> chance<00:05:38.890> to<00:05:39.100> try<00:05:39.280> for

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
it so when you get a chance to try for

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:57.780 
it so when you get a chance to try for
be<00:05:39.670> careful
