Hi, I'm Steven Sashen from XeroShoes.com, and in this short video

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.510
you're gonna discover three things:
first our newest and most exciting

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.950
Xero Shoes product ever, which might look familiar

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.380
but it's gonna do some things you have
never seen before. Secondly,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.340
our updated Cloud and Venture now with the
fastest, easiest lacing system

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.650
ever invented; in fact its patent-pending.
And third, how you can win our new Xero

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.910
shoes products, plus one of up to a dozen

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.939
other products worth over a thousand
dollars. Ready?

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.300
Before I introduce you to the Amuri Z-Trek,
 I want you to start by

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.180
imagining your favorite sport sandal:
Chaco, Teva, Keen

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.149
and now just imagine getting rid up to
70% of the weight

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.739
and almost all of the bulk.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.079
And then imagine doing this with your
favorite sport sandal.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.100
Welcome to the Amuri Z-Trek,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.510
the lightest, most comfortable sport
sandal your feet will ever love.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.829
A men's size 9 weighs only 6.6 ounces.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.119
The webbing system holds securely and
comfortably to your foot for almost

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.390
any activity. Like all our lightweight
performance recreation sandals

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.750
the Z-Trek is perfect for travel
because it packs so small, is great for

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
hiking because with five and a half
millimeters of our exclusive FeelTrue

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.649
rubber

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.569
gives you all the protection you need with
great natural feel. And still true to our

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:17.929
tire-sandal inspiration

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.240
the sole comes with the 5000
Mile Warranty. The Z-Trek is obviously

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.259
a great camp shoe

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.880
but there's some people who are gonna put
these on think they're gonna walk around

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.459
the campsite and then go, you know

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.340
I think I can actually keep going in
these, and then send their boots home.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.380
And we've already had people taking a
run in these and even doing

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.500
ultra marathons. They're water resistant,
vegan,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.259
and the men's and women's are actually
different: you can see that the women's is a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.759
little narrower with slightly narrower
webbing.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.819
Both the men's and women's come in
Coal Black with Castle Rock webbing,

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.220
and Mocha Earth with Coffee Bean, a
darker brown webbing. And then the men

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.899
get a choice of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.160
Slate with Patriot Blue webbing and
women Slate with Hunter Green webbing.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.519
In a moment I'm gonna show you how you
can win a pair of Amuri Z-Trek

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:02.160
or one of dozens of other products
worth over a thousand dollars, but first

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.030
our second big announcement, a major
improvement to our existing products the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.360
Amuri Cloud and the Amuri Venture. Now
let me put things in context

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.930
starting with the venture which really
is the same base

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.310
as on the Z-Trek, but with the huarache
inspired lacing system,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.440
and then the Cloud, actually the same as
the Venture

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.730
except we laid 3mm of BareFoam
 in the forefoot

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.420
to make it extra comfortable and make it even lighter, so light in fact that it floats.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.500
If you're already familiar with our
Cloud or Venture or frankly any other

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.300
companies' huarache-inspired sandals

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.990
you know the hardest part is getting
that perfect fit, getting that snug but

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.680
comfortable tension in all the different
spots you can make those adjustments and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.140
while the lacing system in our Cloud and
Venture is really effective I will

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.380
confess it can be a little tricky for
some people to get it just right

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.370
all the time. Because I spend pretty much
every night as I'm falling asleep thinking

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.850
about ways to improve the lacing

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.220
on huaraches, I'm really really proud
to show you what we come up with.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.910
We have a new patent-pending lacing
system all built around

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.950
this heel strap which is made of nylon
with a

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.410
really comfortable silicone bead and
specially designed hardware, and look

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.250
what happens when you put it on a
Cloud or Venture:

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.610
slide it on your foot, get a snug but comfortable
tension on the top just by pulling lace

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.489
through the angle holes,

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.870
and then just grab the lace-ends and tug.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.500
That's it! Now the Cloud or Venture are held
onto your foot securely for whatever you

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.730
want to do from a walk on the beach to
hike in the woods

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.840
to a 256K ultra-marathon across
Madagascar.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.370
Once you have the right tension to get
these on and off you foot in a second just slide

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.870
the strap

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.060
over your heel. For 2015 the Venture
comes in Black,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.579
Blue and Tangerine. The Cloud you can get in Charcoal,

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.790
Mocha, Lemon or Aquarius. Ready to grab a
pair of these or win a pair these or one

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.190
of dozens of other products worth over a
thousand dollars? I know I keep saying

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.280
that but promise I'll tell you how in a
second. But first I need to tell you that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.650
a big problem that we have and

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.410
actually how you can benefit from it. You
might have heard there's been some

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.959
issues at the ports with the

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.530
dock workers and the unions and...anyway suffice it to say the product that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.410
we're importing

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.900
is stuck in the ocean somewhere and honestly
we don't know when we're gonna get it.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.890
So we spent over twenty thousand dollars
to fly in as much product as we could,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.409
it's only a few thousand pairs

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.859
while that might sound like a lot, after
we were on Shark Tank in the week

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.409
following the show we sold over 3000
pairs,

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.060
and that was before we had all of this. So
if you know that you wanna get the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.419
Z-Trek, or the Cloud or the Venture,

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.099

us your email address. That'll put you on

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.979
