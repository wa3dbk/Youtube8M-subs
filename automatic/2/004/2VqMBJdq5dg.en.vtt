00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
now what you have here is the ribbon

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.199 
now what you have here is the ribbon
connector<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.790> want<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> be<00:02:20.030> very

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
connector and you want to be very

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.090 
connector and you want to be very
careful<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.020> everything<00:02:21.709> I've<00:02:21.860> read

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
careful with this everything I've read

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.270 
careful with this everything I've read
has<00:02:22.940> suggested<00:02:23.540> just<00:02:23.780> how<00:02:23.900> fragile<00:02:24.280> these

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
has suggested just how fragile these

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.870 
has suggested just how fragile these
ribbon<00:02:25.670> connectors<00:02:26.150> actually<00:02:26.660> are<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.430> you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
ribbon connectors actually are so if you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.610 
ribbon connectors actually are so if you
look<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.540> edges<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.200> ribbon

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
look at the edges of the ribbon

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.110 
look at the edges of the ribbon
