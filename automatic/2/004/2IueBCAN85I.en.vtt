00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.010
 the destruction of the comet and they are 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.360
 with enough disappointment we just knew 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.570
 that the Jason comet has volatilized 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.029
 when approaching peri helium the path 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.480
 predicted comet is shown in this 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.070
 first schematic image in these 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.220
 animated sequences obtained through 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.890
 chronographs lasko c2 and c3 del 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.809
 soho satellite we can see how the comet 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.000
 is approaching the sun decreasing its 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.870
 luminosity one hour before reaching 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.610
 the minimum proximity towards 18 hours 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 of November 28 , 2013 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.260
 an hour later the comet has 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.240
 disappeared and only the tail is left 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.629
 diffuse that appears slightly by the 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.180
 another end of the sphere of the star 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.149
 finally we can only say that it has been 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.260
 exciting a greeting and until the next 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.410
 Kite 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.410
 ah 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.539
 and they are survive alperi the me 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.520
 who has said that astronomy is not 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.920
 exciting 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.829
 less than an hour after having 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.100
 announced the death of the comet and are the 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.320
 eye waves send new images that 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.550
 indicate that at least a small part 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.370
 has survived the solar oven 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.090
 in this picture of the 21 28 time 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.460
 universal we see how it already stands out 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 northern end of the sun a small trace 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.690
 bright this indicates that part of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.909
 comet has been destroyed but something has 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.560
 got passed 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.810
 in these moments we feel 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 twinned with this stone and its adventure 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.140
 solar 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.970
 this little bit will not be enough 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.009
 to give a great show during the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.530
 month of December although the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.239
 planned orbit in advance notwithstanding 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 although it is not a great show has 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.520
 it was worth a greeting
