 we can save by going with you 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.050
 myself with the jumpers 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.090

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.460
 while iris work transmitting i am 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.579
 rest steeply climb them tense 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.540
 scarf on 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.360
 give you all screen types the position 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.530
 done during this yourself 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.240
 perfect at your wk 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.460
 putting this jumps to the 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.440
 how impressive you were that this one 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.890
 good mood good considering yes sure 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 all right 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.009
 and maybe it was a little too 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.409
 optimistic but yes you will still come 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.600
 one and then they climb was in itself is 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.759
 but feels natural than motor 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.130
 good last times 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.970
 Yes 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 all a bit of that then 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.320
 that group is set of 20 men with 30 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.550
 but together and logically we then the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 muses another team on 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.110
 last climb off of that was me too 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.830
 with lighting, it is full of disaster 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.750
 and will 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.490
 yes that is also partly because it 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.380
 have been active must begin 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.899
