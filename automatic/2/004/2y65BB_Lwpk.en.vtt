00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.920 
put the bolt guide in the bolt and put
the<00:03:01.390> spring<00:03:03.420> wait<00:03:04.420> you're<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.600> fun<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.840> show

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
the spring wait you're the fun to show

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.410 
the spring wait you're the fun to show
you<00:03:05.019> something<00:03:05.200> I'm<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.739> peer<00:03:06.010> spring<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:07.180> not

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
you something I'm a peer spring is not

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.150 
you something I'm a peer spring is not
connected<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.019> your<00:03:08.140> bolt<00:03:08.410> don't<00:03:08.920> worry<00:03:09.100> about

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
it's not connected because usually when

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.559

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
here is connected to the spring so don't

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.270 
here is connected to the spring so don't
be<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:24.030> don't<00:03:25.030> go<00:03:25.180> all<00:03:25.269> crazy<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:26.799> your<00:03:27.040> bolt

be all don't go all crazy if your bolt
is<00:03:27.549> my<00:03:27.760> connect<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.209> your<00:03:28.269> spring<00:03:28.510> because

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
is my connect to your spring because

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.030 
is my connect to your spring because
mine<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.109> came<00:03:29.260> off<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.530> some<00:03:29.650> reason<00:03:29.920> but

going<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> put<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.269> back<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.540> your<00:03:34.569> gun

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.490 

and<00:03:38.620> there's<00:03:39.620> going<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.860> be<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:41.170> hole<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.380> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
and there's going to be a hole in the

and there's going to be a hole in the
back<00:03:42.740> of<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.430> boat<00:03:44.030> guy<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.020> have<00:03:45.110> to
