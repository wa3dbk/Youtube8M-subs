surfer Joe surfer and kite surfer and so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.889 
surfer Joe surfer and kite surfer and so
when<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> comes<00:00:53.549> to<00:00:53.699> shaping<00:00:53.899> surfboards

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
when when it comes to shaping surfboards

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
when when it comes to shaping surfboards
he<00:00:55.260> knows<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.589> he's<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.390> new

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
he knows what he's good so the new

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
he knows what he's good so the new
rocket<00:01:00.839> fish<00:01:00.989> line<00:01:01.229> consists<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.039> three

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
rocket fish line consists of three

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
rocket fish line consists of three
boards<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.119> a<00:01:03.239> 56<00:01:03.869> a<00:01:04.170> 59<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.250> 60<00:01:06.409> this<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
boards it's a 56 a 59 and a 60 this is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.169 
boards it's a 56 a 59 and a 60 this is
kind<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.860> new<00:01:07.950> concept<00:01:08.399> basically<00:01:08.789> what

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
kind of a new concept basically what

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.240 
kind of a new concept basically what
what<00:01:09.569> it<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.440> small<00:01:10.740> medium<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
what it is is it's a small medium and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
what it is is it's a small medium and
large<00:01:11.310> board<00:01:11.819> each<00:01:12.690> board<00:01:13.050> has<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> really

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
large board each board has a really

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
large board each board has a really
similar<00:01:14.069> shape<00:01:14.399> it's<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.789> same<00:01:15.030> sort<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
similar shape it's the same sort of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.559 
similar shape it's the same sort of
concept<00:01:15.860> they<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.009> work<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.940> pretty<00:01:18.210> wide

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
concept they all work in a pretty wide

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.990 
concept they all work in a pretty wide
range<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.020> conditions<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.710> work<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.700> small

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
range of conditions they work from small

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.950 
range of conditions they work from small
surf<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.600> pretty<00:01:22.200> big<00:01:22.229> surf<00:01:23.569> but<00:01:24.569> basically

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
surf two pretty big surf but basically

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
surf two pretty big surf but basically
having<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.310> sizes<00:01:26.550> small<00:01:27.179> medium

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
having the three sizes small medium

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
having the three sizes small medium
large<00:01:27.860> makes<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.130> easy<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.549> someone

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
large makes it really easy for someone

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
large makes it really easy for someone
to<00:01:30.149> purchase<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.960> board<00:01:31.200> make<00:01:31.770> him<00:01:31.890> walk<00:01:32.009> into

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to purchase a board make him walk into

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
to purchase a board make him walk into
it<00:01:32.399> into<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> shop<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.890> depending<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:34.979> their

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it into a shop and depending on their

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
it into a shop and depending on their
way<00:01:36.110> they<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.530> pick<00:01:37.649> board<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.039> know<00:01:38.130> if

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
way they can pick board you know if

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.649 
way they can pick board you know if
they're<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.399> medium<00:01:38.759> sized<00:01:38.970> rider<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.509> can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
they're a medium sized rider they can

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.300 
they're a medium sized rider they can
take<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.899> 59<00:01:40.289> if<00:01:40.440> they're<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> bigger<00:01:41.039> rider

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
take the 59 if they're a bigger rider

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.480 
take the 59 if they're a bigger rider
like<00:01:41.579> myself<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:42.259> read<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> six<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.219> it's

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
like myself I read the six out so it's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.270 
like myself I read the six out so it's
pretty<00:01:44.700> easy<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> choose<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.600> board

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
pretty easy to choose the right board

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.910 
pretty easy to choose the right board
you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.649 

these<00:01:53.920> boards<00:01:54.250> are<00:01:54.430> great<00:01:54.729> for<00:01:54.970> going<00:01:55.180> top<00:01:55.450> to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
these boards are great for going top to

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.359 
these boards are great for going top to
bottom<00:01:55.960> on<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.140> way<00:01:56.260> if<00:01:56.409> you<00:01:56.530> can<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:57.100> can<00:01:57.220> go

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
bottom on the way if you can you can go

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.790 
bottom on the way if you can you can go
straight<00:01:57.790> up<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.270> snap<00:01:58.960> off<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.350> top<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.560> go

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
straight up and snap off the top and go

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.250 
straight up and snap off the top and go
vertically<00:02:00.310> straight<00:02:00.580> back<00:02:00.790> down<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:01.900> can

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
vertically straight back down so you can

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.710 
vertically straight back down so you can
basically<00:02:02.380> draw<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.369> turns<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> way<00:02:04.060> then

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
basically draw you turns on the way then

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.520 
basically draw you turns on the way then
that's<00:02:05.380> exactly<00:02:05.830> what<00:02:06.280> they're<00:02:06.490> made<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.670> do

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that's exactly what they're made to do

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's exactly what they're made to do
so<00:02:08.530> after<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.890> lot<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.069> fin<00:02:09.340> testing<00:02:09.819> we<00:02:10.179> decided

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
so after a lot of fin testing we decided

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.660 
so after a lot of fin testing we decided
to<00:02:10.690> go<00:02:10.840> with<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.020> softer<00:02:11.380> flex<00:02:11.980> your<00:02:12.160> fin<00:02:12.400> for

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
to go with a softer flex your fin for

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.850 
to go with a softer flex your fin for
2008<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:14.080> gives<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> board<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> really<00:02:14.739> nice

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
2008 that gives the board a really nice

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.410 
2008 that gives the board a really nice
to<00:02:15.010> feel<00:02:15.130> through<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.459> water<00:02:15.640> makes<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> feel

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to feel through the water makes it feel

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.570 
to feel through the water makes it feel
really<00:02:16.780> responsive<00:02:17.290> through<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> turns<00:02:17.800> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
really responsive through the turns and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.760 
really responsive through the turns and
it<00:02:18.730> also<00:02:18.880> makes<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.270> possible<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.930> break<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
it also makes it possible to break the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.350 
it also makes it possible to break the
tail<00:02:20.950> free<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.520> break<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.850> fins<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
tail free and break the fins out of the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:32.840 
tail free and break the fins out of the
water<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.810> your<00:02:23.020> top<00:02:23.230> turn

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.700 

so<00:02:33.850> there's<00:02:34.090> also<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.360> double<00:02:34.750> density<00:02:34.990> pad<00:02:35.410> on

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
so there's also a double density pad on

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.710 
so there's also a double density pad on
the<00:02:35.770> new<00:02:35.920> rocket<00:02:36.220> fish<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.940> softer<00:02:37.510> layer

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the new rocket fish it's a softer layer

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.690 
the new rocket fish it's a softer layer
underneath<00:02:38.440> with<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> harder<00:02:39.250> layer<00:02:39.430> over<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
underneath with a harder layer over the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.390 
underneath with a harder layer over the
top<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.570> really<00:02:40.840> grippy<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.470> its<00:02:42.250> really

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
top it's really grippy and its really

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.370
