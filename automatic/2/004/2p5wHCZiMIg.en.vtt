according<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> Freddie<00:01:08.490> Mac<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> quick<00:01:09.450> initial

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
according to Freddie Mac a quick initial

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.149 
according to Freddie Mac a quick initial
estimate<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.590> determined<00:01:11.130> by

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
estimate can be determined by

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
estimate can be determined by
multiplying<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:11.939> gross<00:01:12.210> annual<00:01:12.390> household

income<00:01:13.290> by<00:01:13.590> 2.5<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.270> calculation

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
income by 2.5 but this calculation

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.780 
income by 2.5 but this calculation
doesn't<00:01:16.229> fully<00:01:16.409> consider<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:16.979> expenses<00:01:17.610> or

doesn't fully consider your expenses or
your<00:01:18.150> existing<00:01:18.689> debt<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.500> best<00:01:19.740> way<00:01:19.950> to

your existing debt the best way to

your existing debt the best way to
factor<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.210> calculating<00:01:21.479> your

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
factor these in is by calculating your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.679 
factor these in is by calculating your
debt<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> income<00:01:22.650> ratio<00:01:23.509> eventually<00:01:24.509> your

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
debt to income ratio eventually your

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.749 
debt to income ratio eventually your
mortgage<00:01:25.049> lender<00:01:25.080> will<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.220> but

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
mortgage lender will do this for you but

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.280 
mortgage lender will do this for you but
you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> head<00:01:27.420> start<00:01:27.600> by<00:01:27.930> doing<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you can get a head start by doing the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.859 
you can get a head start by doing the
calculation<00:01:28.920> yourself<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:30.150> next<00:01:30.479> step<00:01:30.689> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
calculation yourself the next step is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.359 
calculation yourself the next step is
finding<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> mortgage<00:01:31.500> professional<00:01:32.189> and
