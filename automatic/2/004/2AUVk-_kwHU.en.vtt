so<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.679> they<00:01:29.220> break<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:30.149> Kabul<00:01:30.860> right<00:01:32.539> it

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
so when they break the Kabul right it

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.399 
so when they break the Kabul right it
forces<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.159> torch<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> fall<00:01:35.909> down<00:01:36.289> making<00:01:37.289> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
forces the torch to fall down making the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.949 
forces the torch to fall down making the
gravel<00:01:38.100> fall<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:39.240> sure<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.929> extra

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
gravel fall make sure you have one extra

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.130 
gravel fall make sure you have one extra
so<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.830> gravel<00:01:41.220> goes<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.640> slot<00:01:41.970> makes<00:01:42.959> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so the gravel goes in that slot makes it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.999 
so the gravel goes in that slot makes it
even<00:01:43.369> which<00:01:44.369> breaks<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.060> torch<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.800> mix

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
even which breaks the torch in the mix

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.339 
even which breaks the torch in the mix
then<00:01:47.429> fall<00:01:47.610> down<00:01:47.789> this<00:01:48.569> assassin<00:01:49.019> get<00:01:49.170> over
