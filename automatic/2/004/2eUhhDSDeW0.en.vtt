00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.170
 and how quickly it takes responsibility 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.300

 I have a light here already 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 We take from bushels 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 chopped well washed at best 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 still about it all 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.710
 then spice up milk for something 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 to bring in liquid 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.049
 I am the man's friend of spices 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:54.110
 Just a little bit of turmeric 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.110
 I suppose salt is good for me 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.100
 wonderfully sweet 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.909

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:14.210
 simply I have no extra 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:17.810
 buttons just when I do that 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.399
 whole rum real life is getting up 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.420
 Me, I can stop on the 5, 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.460
 fall back spruce 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.770
 namely that goes but then again 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.259
 back and can be there just that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.920
 always press on the smoothie maker 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.920
 light again 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.510

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.610
 Here you are done 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.070

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.740

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.960
 I'm not so well then 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.720
 the whole thing a bit thick for itself 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 it must be quiet in one , too 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.850
