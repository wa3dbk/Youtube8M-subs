abdominus muscle makes up part of the

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.130 
abdominus muscle makes up part of the
core<00:00:14.620> musculature<00:00:15.390> and<00:00:16.390> a<00:00:16.480> lot<00:00:16.660> of<00:00:16.779> people

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.669 
this muscle tends to be long and weak
and<00:00:19.449> so<00:00:19.599> therefore<00:00:19.990> it<00:00:20.079> needs<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.560> be
