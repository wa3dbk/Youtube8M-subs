 hello to all youtube friends 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.250
 Welcome once again to my section 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.470
 tutorials where we install mods and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.590
 sometimes very interesting skins to 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.750
 our gta san andreas well before 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.270
 start with this tutorial answer me 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.640
 this you are tired of the visuality of 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.830
 your gta san andreas you go up to the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.260
 buildings and you can hardly see a 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.960
 forest and you climb to very high places and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.989
 you do not see any city if it is so 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.670
 then this is your video the first thing that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.640
 have to do is go to the link of the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.100
 description of the video and download the mod 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.080
 I do not because I have downloaded aja 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.239
 once downloaded they will have a 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.190
 rar file called best quality of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.409
 sight or distance for your gta san 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.890
 folder with the same file name 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.080
 The inside of the folder will remain 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.600
 some images of the mod a file of 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.670

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.770

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.140

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.659

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.789

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.740
 so that then there is no 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.440
