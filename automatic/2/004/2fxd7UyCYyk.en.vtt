00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.640
 here in the library of salt and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000

 click on the coebad then it will 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.989
 loaded you go to read and then 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 the folder is completely loaded and you 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.039
 can start reading now 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.860
 they have on the right on the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 on the right side the controls too 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.320
 Mark and edit things 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.600
 you notes or marks you in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 want to leave the folder in order for themselves 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.030
 Remember memories or important ones 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 things you want to remember 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.470
 to be able to use 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 Below a booklet is the service 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.340
 navigation in the folder where you are 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.009
 then you can scroll 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.900
 bookmarks we can go too 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.340
 let's go forward with it 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 all very simple and simple and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.500
 self-explanatory, we too 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 go so far to the table of contents 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 The table of contents is structured in this way 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 that every chapter of each one yes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.570
 chapter has left a link if that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.659
 they click on it and they'll get it right away 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.369
 immediately to the topic what you selected 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.880
 have and you can read along immediately 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.740
 begin 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.729
 This saves you a lot of time 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.680
 they just look in 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.869
 table of contents for what interests 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.980
 I succeeded immediately and can immediately with 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.900
 start reading there 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.090
 you can also use plus here below 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.430
 to enlarge the text I show you here 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.560
 the year with a pc so I take 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.050
 someone desktop with a video on and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.500
 show them so it looks the size 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.270
 may be a bit different with them 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.450
 also the form there if you with one 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.000
 tablet or smartphone read the whole 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.740
 but the functions remain all the same 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.140
 So they can now also here 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.840
 put a bookmark if you want 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.260
 that that they can remember that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.480
 then left is the function bookmark 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.230
 so they just go edit 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 to plus and can then enter here 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 For example, write something that you 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:48.040
 can remember better 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:49.280
 read my reading and then read 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.530
 to save 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.470
 and if she returns to that now 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.170
 go bookmarks you see here is one 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 bookmarks and they are back 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.980
 on the website 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.820
 Now you have the opportunity 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.320
 I have a bit down now 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.180
 scrolled they have now on the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.370
 right side just the possibility things 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.340
 to highlight the text for example with 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.660
 the light pen with the yellow go 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.700
 just click on the a and then 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.320
 go to the text mark 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.739
 the area you have marked 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.690
 want to go to the top right of this 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.110
 save a sign and a small one 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.640
 diskette then this is in your account 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.040
 saved and thus if every time 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.519
 we come back here , they find that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.170
 so they can see this again 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.630
 Of course you can also do these things 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.280
 they have marked or text the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.920
 you have written in from notes 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.320
 by themselves you can hide with 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.840
 Hide the eye here again if you 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.850
 For example, you epaper someone's times 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.670
 want and no marks or 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.980
 notes in it just want to have it 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.049
 if they use it again for themselves 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.420
 want with the markings etc easy 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.360
 Click the eye again and it will appear 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.980
 everything again 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.020
 if then the case occurs that they 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.300
 say okay this mark i want 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.790
 they do not have any more above 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.580
 to edit the possibility to click 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.120
 then go into the text that marks you 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.180
 to have 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.740
 and then press the delete key 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.080
 your keyboard or on your smartphone 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 or tablet and then it disappears 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.860
 mark or your note or what 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.720
 they have always deposited on it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.310
 these are the simplest functions 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.870
 they have just that here 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.460
 opportunity for example too 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.169
 emphasize that I show briefly 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.580
 Just go in the text and 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.860
 already they see the whole thing is 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.870
 underline again and save it 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.270
 is again stored in your account 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.040
 I like to leave the other functions 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.290
 they discover a bit and for themselves 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.330
 let them try out their fantasy 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.550
 Run free and use it that way 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.430
 intuitive as you find that suits you 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.870
