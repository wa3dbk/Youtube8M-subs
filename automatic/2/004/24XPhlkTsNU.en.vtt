00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
 that's it 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.120
 hi how are youtube people so 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.130
 another video of mister felix and I bring today 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.549
 a box sing and a review of the inn 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.530
 official for apple iphone 5 s this 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.389
 is the case that they took when they launched 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.889
 the iphone that also works for the 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.370
 iphone 5 but it is made for iphone 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.520
 5 s this is coming in 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.650
 in skin as you can see here back 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.610
 explains and also tells you that these 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.070
 covers are going to be spent over time 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.420
 because obviously it's skin then 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.340
 that way is not going to stay this 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.720
 same color now this one comes in 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.510
 different colors what I have here is 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.050
 the red one but it also comes in beige coffee 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.230
 black yellow and blue 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 has a cost of $ 39 at the price 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.100
 in Mexico 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.720
 has a tag 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.620
 but michelle 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.620
 and pretty 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.820
 we are going to take it out 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.170
 we only pull 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 or 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.420
 I know we have the very simple cover can 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.090
 inside has a microfiber 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.860
 which is the same color of the case though 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.390
 how was it like you can see there 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 end our case more in the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.979
 back on the sides of splinter 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.100
 normal feels very soft more or less 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.130
 as the skin of the frames see uncheck 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.320
 of ipad in 50 is the best material 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.810
 inside let's see 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.940
 over here you have the buttons are 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.330
 closed just like the buttons for 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.670
 raise and lower the volume had a one 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.630
 black ring this is to reduce the brightness 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 Wheeler when taking pictures with flash 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 let's insert 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.270
 and now not the perfect entry for 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.270
 back we have apple logo are powers 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.390
 and we can see that he has what he is called 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.799
 a law a taboo design he means 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.540
 when you put the iphone mouth 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.149
 down 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.590
 the screen is not going to touch the table 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.150
 this way with us puts it like this 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.850
 is going to grate nothing without which is very 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.880
 good for covers and something because it's 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.060
 parents here so that you are able to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.060
 watch 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.340
 can still see as the edge 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.959
 silver is that they did it with diamond 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.340
 so when you see in the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.530
 background in front of which the camera can not 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.560
 see why to know this they see it live 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.580
 they will see that there is a small ring with a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 Silver edge to make it the color of 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.720
 iphone again the same color of 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.340
 It is also works with the iPhone 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.410
 5 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.610
 the buttons are covered in leather what 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.069
 which at the beginning is going to be a bit 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 difficult to maneuver are not as 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.879
 click and as if they did not have it 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.500
 now with time as it is skin they go 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:59.750
 to go loosening and they will be a little more 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.760
 easy to operate now this for me is a 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.030
 little hard to get others if they have 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.110
 a longer nail will be easier by 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.430
 down 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.700
 you can see that the buttons are 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.030
 perfectly aligned the hearing aid 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.690
 the lightning connects the speakers and the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.480
 microphone now the speakers have 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.040
 perfect aligned but the microphone is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.640
 can see there will take a row 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.219
 this is to make the hole of the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.129
 microphone a little bigger now a 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.659
 The defect in this case is that the 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.990
 adapter that comes pedestrian to 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:44.260
 connecting the 30 pins will not work 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.390
 keep buying the cable then if 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.010
 have this adapter is then for 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.690
 to use it they're going to have to remove the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.860
 found and while trump to be able to use it 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.990
 so 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.500
 I really like to start, I'm a fan of 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.480
 This cover is very father and the logo of 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.040
 Apple apple all very well 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.620
 this one even a case that looks very 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.689
 here class I recommend this case 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.329
 now as I mentioned and as it says in the 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.010
 box is going to be damaged over time because 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.480
 dismiss the name another positive thing of 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.049
 these covers that do not have much flex 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.359
 this is when the edges bend and you 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.009
 open and that's bad because the cover of the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.449
 iphone can fall and can be damaged 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.180
 for the microfiber that comes here 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.590
 inside is for dust because when 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.930
 the dust enters is going to stay here 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.650
 inside and it will not be moving and 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.060
 scratching the back of your iphone and 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.250
 that's all for today I hope you have them 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.800
 liked the boxing hom and a little 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.070
 review of what is the official cover of 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.710
 Manzana 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.450
 of the iphone 5 and 5 s do not forget 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.730
 signing the portion below one 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.470
