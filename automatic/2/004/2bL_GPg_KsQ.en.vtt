00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
beginning of every turn you can produce

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.560 
beginning of every turn you can produce
fish<00:00:59.409> tokens<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.549> you<00:01:00.670> have<00:01:00.970> all<00:01:01.150> these<00:01:01.299> fish

these<00:02:19.860> numbers<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.370> produced<00:02:20.700> or<00:02:20.970> rolled<00:02:21.960> if

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
these numbers are produced or rolled if

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.510 
these numbers are produced or rolled if
you<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.350> senior<00:02:22.710> Solomon's<00:02:23.160> there<00:02:23.310> you'll<00:02:23.430> be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
you got senior Solomon's there you'll be

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.060 
you got senior Solomon's there you'll be
able<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.850> draw<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.270> fish<00:02:24.450> hex<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.710> if<00:02:25.920> it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
able to draw a fish hex so if it

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.650 
able to draw a fish hex so if it
actually<00:02:26.250> becomes<00:02:26.790> one<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.240> top

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
actually becomes one of the top

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.880 
actually becomes one of the top
producing<00:02:28.260> taxes<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.820> any<00:02:30.300> game<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> there's<00:02:31.830> a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
producing taxes in any game so there's a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.650 
producing taxes in any game so there's a
lot<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.160> fish<00:02:32.310> production<00:02:32.610> coming<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.150> so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
lot of fish production coming out so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.810 
lot of fish production coming out so
that<00:02:33.990> that's<00:02:34.320> really<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.700> about

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
that that's really a that's just about
