00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.700
 end up always wanting to take advantage of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 Anything but a good boy is a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 vain boy but it's cool

 love of his life that is bright here 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 I could not talk right 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490
 but it's ok 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
 Clean tab I'm already on the product 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.479
 kisses 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.550
 the summer tale tells about the various 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.500
 discoveries of adolescence in life 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.910
 Your personal what was most difficult 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.150
 transition from childhood to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.530
 I think adolescence for me is 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.880
 change has always been very natural. 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.860
 that I actually had one more brother 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.450
 old man then it ends up the steps people 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.950
 is approaching the age of them goes 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 Getting used to me was normal. 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.280
 not all the difference in the time that people 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.080
 miss something even joking 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.430
 worry about fewer things but I 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.470
 I think it was a natural way 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.900
 ends up getting to know him, too, as his 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.510
 Brother, I have an older brother. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.920
 That's why I speak the line, and I too. 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.599
 I think responsibility and I 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 took a little surprise as soon as I 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.640
 I turned 18 and I heard the differences that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.760
 What happens to us like this? 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.959
 that's how we change when we 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.430
 find someone also the link to people 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.430
 do you like to know what? 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.430
 out other things college work 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.140
 anyway I certainly felt this 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 this growth 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.970
 and you f I also felt a helper 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.109
 pretty good growth 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 I think so, but I think when 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.010
 if the child is a lack of responsibility 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.000
 It brings a joy that you have to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.150
 find when you start working 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.709
 when you start to find pleasure and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.450
 Other stuff, I do not know how to play. 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.450
 so I find it very interesting 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.700
 op 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.569
 and then I 'll go and interview you now 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:53.980
 Hey, did not you start the question session? 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:57.650
 the old alice wants a help fire there 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.250
 We closed my love if you make me a 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.840
 those you get in the first over as 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.879
 She went to review her work colleagues. 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.470
 guilherme prates and guilherme leicam e 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.220
 how did it work with him again in 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.810
 family 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.010
 It was wonderful felt at home it was 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.590
 Because there are a lot of cast members. 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.230
 including working out there then I 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.970
 I feel like I think it was a 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.169
 continued we grew together 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.970
 matured a lot together 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.410
 It's a very different story, it 's very 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.880
 different from what we did at work 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.949
 So I think it was really cool, people. 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.139
 grew up together even on television in 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.960
 work out you live the protagonist 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.479
 young lady and now in the family soap opera 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.840
 You play the villain with china or with 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.660
 this contrast arrives he is enjoying 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.120
 I'm loving my face, I think it's 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.710
 very different character is very cool 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.169
 I think it's one of the best I've ever done 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.789
 so it's different and it's do not know I think 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.800
 we can explore much know why 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.020
 it has a good side and the bad side having 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.630
 I think she's human so she has the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.180
 her problems with the family and then I think 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.250
 who out of the house creates a character she 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.510
 pretends that it is something that may not 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.190
 be both 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.979
 and then she has his villainy with him 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.750
 peeve right she's a person say 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.250
 that she has a good side of her but the side 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.250
 Bad prevails a little bit 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.600
 Look, it's what you think he has in 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.500
 common 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.940
 That 's what I said. I think the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.220
 people always end up lending a 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.400
 little of us for the character 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.660
 I did an uc shopping now with 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.960
 coaching new york 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.080
 Steven was crazy he said that the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.090
 actor he does not put a mask is dish 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.670
 it's like he already had several masks 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.080
 and if you take one know with each 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.730
 character then I think we 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.350
 lends in a way a little bit more 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.480
 china is a she has a personality 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.120
 which is unlike anything I've ever 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.250
 I knew so she is thank god already 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.130
 You know nothing seems cruel. 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.990
 so I think it's very different from me 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.760
 Now tell us a secret here. 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.740
 much secret is a very thing 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.050
 It's important that you count how long you 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.480
 recorded in Goiás how was it to stay there and how 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.010
 was dismissed for the second phase there was 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.380
 Well cool, I've never recorded it before. 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.020
 It was very interesting, yes. 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.360
 The city is small but it is already 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.190
 people super well know and everyone wanted 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.410
 participate a little in recordings they 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.210
 they wanted to do figuration, then 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.800
 participated quite well we 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.510
 took several photos with them 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.270
 They welcomed us very well. 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:34.250
 legal authority to take part in the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:36.420
 comes the match did not is not for me 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.730
 just put the biggest parade in the 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.170
 footbridge 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:45.000
 Look at the competitors here said that the 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.530
 end of the second stage if you already have 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.630
 project ahead 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.190
 well then I plan to travel extensively account 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.220
 in this beautiful piece that we 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.260
 here on the river and wants to travel more and 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.750
 tv I still have nothing should roll the 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.640
 Flashbacks out there will wait 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.990
 and I'm still in college there 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.460
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:08.130
 there be forward 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:11.340
 did not see but there's something in that pregnant woman 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:14.669
 good if it is and postponed the marriage is because 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.960
 lost the baby, right or shot, will not 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.560
 River 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.729
 Our way, good people, this is what I hope. 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.130
 that you have enjoyed meeting 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.990
 these investors here are you 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.630
 to watch while all summer 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.460
 Thursday at 7 o'clock in the local time 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.650
 theater vanucci in the mall of the gávea here 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.900
 in the river saw and continue to follow the 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.780
 Chinese and family evils and live 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:40.199
 Kiss, people, it seemed like your eyes 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.120
 I already knew what passion is 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:44.280
 When you speak, choose only the wrong time. 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.940
 brings the solution 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:50.030
 opposites attract if they say ask for 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.030
 that 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:03.470
 summer day point of love prevents 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.470
 she is beyond 

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.470
 ah
