00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.509
 today we are going to make mini ciabatta let's 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.059
 need a first starter 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.089
 that we will need 100 milliliters of water 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.889
 10 grams of fresh yeast 180 grams 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.490
 of force flour and a teaspoon of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.929
 sugar for the dough we will need 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.019
 260 milliliters of water the rest of 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.880
 packages of fresh yeast 430 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.640
 grams of flour force one tablespoon 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.020
 salt and 50 ml of oil 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.820
 extra virgin olive 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.040
 in the breadmaker's account 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.910
 starting making the starter mass 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.400
 the water the yeast the sugar and the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 flour that needs the starter dough 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.670
 We take it to the breadmaker 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 we selected program 6 that the one 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 Knead and you will 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.129
 and once we have this little mass 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 Kneaded and raised starter 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.089
 We will continue if you do not have breadmaker 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.149
 you do it loving, we cover the ball of 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.170
 mass and one hour resting that is the most 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.549
 there that has solved and you can already 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.659
 add the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.009
 of the sheet metal is the water the oil the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.009
 yeast flour 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.570
 and salt salt always on the side 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.790
 opposite of the yeast so that it does not 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 have contact because if you do not salt 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 it takes away the yeast and we go back to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.520
 the same operation in the bakery 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.150
 program 6 that has amassed higher and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.250
 that is the beyond that has elevated 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
 that mass equal if we do not have 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.710
 breadmaker we make the last mother 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 we let it rest an hour will pass that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.850
 hour or past the time of the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.100
 bakery that is the mass we pass to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.830
 the work table 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.009
 without tinkering the lot let's give it a 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.950
 double a tip to the center the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.780
 mass a sticky mass but do not 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.030
 let's go throw flour in the dough has 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.520
 to be without sticky so we 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 we help from a paper of these vegetable 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.410
 we help each other with the racket and we double 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 one end part of the other end to 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.360
 center and we extend a little bit either 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.110
 it is necessary to remove everything the dough will go 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.550
 or grope her a lot and touch the mass with 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.130
 quick movements so that we are not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.430
 stick in the hands let stand 30 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.660
 minutes and we repeat the operation of a 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 point for the center 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 has said that it gives a little twist to the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.829
 tray to fold now the tips 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.280
 opposite of a tip to inside and 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.010
 from the other side to the inside and this is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.689
 the second double that we do 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.329
 and once we have done it 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.690
 we repeat the same operation as in the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:57.420
 first we crush a little 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.420
 and let's rest another half hour 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.560
 let's try and giving the dough 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.269
 a rectangular shape for when 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.849
 then let's get out the mini sheet 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.940
 is we have already the shape more or less 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.290
 predefined 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.290
 quick movements so that the mass 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.230
 do not stick in our hands a rest 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.010
 of half an hour and we make the third and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.610
 last double we double the tip for the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:33.280
 center the other end for the other center 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:37.160
 and what we have left is that mass goes to 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.900
 spread it gently with your hands 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.990
 hands do not use the roller 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.570
 kitchen because if we take roll of 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.940
 Wood will remove all the air 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.190
 we have gotten to the mass and not us 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.130
 interest with the hands movements 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.200
 fast so that the dough does not stick 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.590
 we are going to give it a rectangular shape or 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.560
 square shape and we have to have the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.470
 mass fully extended a thickness of 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.600
 a finger and a half finger or so 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.510
 and once we have it extended 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.959
 let's sprinkle with flour 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.939
 and what we have left and giving the cuts 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.729
 to remove the mini plates with the 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.989
 rackets or with a sharp knife like 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.669
 you want 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.320
 let's go removing the mini shoes 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:30.220
 first we give a cut to everything 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.350
 long in half and already each piece what 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.660
 we divide in four and we take four 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.360
 mini ciabatta 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.610
 the mass for treating it with the maximum 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.460
 Be careful not to lose a lot of air 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.650
 let's try to give it a rectangular shape 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.690
 So that the shoe is more or 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.240
 less beautiful the shoe two have to 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.770
 look exactly the same in the beauty of 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.730
 the shoes that have that shape 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.100
 irregular and homemade and good that dough goes to 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.490
 return to rest another half hour before 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.630
 to go into the oven 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.790
 sprinkle 'we have with flour before 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.510
 put it in the oven the oven has to 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:11.600
 be preheated to maximum power and 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.450
 at the bottom of the oven we are going to put a 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.130
 metallic pot when we go to put 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.690
 the shoes in the oven 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.720
 in this metal pot that will be 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.600
 very hot add a little water 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.210
 boiling and we closed running the oven 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.420
 and for 5 minutes they go to the ciabatta 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.080
 with if it does not do about 210 degrees 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.240
 temperature past five minutes 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.680
 we take out the metal tray with the little 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.170
 water that is left knee will be 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.670
 turned everything into steam and we leave this 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:47.570
 veneer is about 10 more minutes about 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.700
 180 200 degrees and good and that's the 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.020
 result when we take it out simply 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.880
 they remain in the return we give him some 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.360
 taps if it sounds hollow is that the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.760
 plates to be fully cooked and 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.390
 baked and finished and we only 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.000
 remains 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.570
 that cool well on a grid 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.330
 so that we do not get wet in the 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.160
 Contact vellum and no longer 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.820
 we only have to enjoy these 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.390
 shoes that 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.550
 which are in mini format and are very rich 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.250
 both to eat and to do 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.280
 montaditos because nothing I hope that I have 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.280
 liked
