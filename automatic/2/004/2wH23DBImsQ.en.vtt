hey I'm rolling with more by geeks and

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.150 
hey I'm rolling with more by geeks and
what<00:00:06.720> we're<00:00:06.870> gonna<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.200> right<00:00:07.230> now<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> quick

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
what we're gonna do right now is a quick

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.660 
what we're gonna do right now is a quick
gaming<00:00:08.610> test<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.900> Moto<00:00:10.170> e<00:00:10.500> so<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.400> device

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
gaming test on the Moto e so the device

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.240 
gaming test on the Moto e so the device
is<00:00:11.969> basically<00:00:12.509> pretty<00:00:13.110> well<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.500> equipped<00:00:14.009> for

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
is basically pretty well is equipped for

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.680 
is basically pretty well is equipped for
the<00:00:15.240> price<00:00:15.509> at<00:00:15.809> least<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.320> only<00:00:17.600> 7000<00:00:18.600> rupees

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the price at least it's only 7000 rupees

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.490 
the price at least it's only 7000 rupees
in<00:00:19.050> India<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.240> think<00:00:21.689> 110

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
in India so that's about I think 110

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.050 
in India so that's about I think 110
maybe<00:00:23.430> 118<00:00:24.150> dollars<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.980> under<00:00:26.369> 90

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
maybe 118 dollars and just under 90

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.200 
maybe 118 dollars and just under 90
euros<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> Germany<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.470> example<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
euros and Germany for example you get a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930 
euros and Germany for example you get a
dual-core<00:00:30.750> Snapdragon<00:00:31.590> 200<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.759> get

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
dual-core Snapdragon 200 in here you get

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.799 
dual-core Snapdragon 200 in here you get
one<00:00:33.210> gig<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.719> ram<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> great<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:35.940> qHD

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
one gig of ram which is great a qHD

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.920 
one gig of ram which is great a qHD
resolution<00:00:37.020> screen<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> bad

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
resolution screen and and that's the bad

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
resolution screen and and that's the bad
thing<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.370> four<00:00:41.670> gigs<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
thing about this the four gigs of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.139 
thing about this the four gigs of
onboard<00:00:42.840> flash<00:00:42.899> storage<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> these<00:00:44.789> turn<00:00:45.000> out

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
onboard flash storage so these turn out

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.000 
onboard flash storage so these turn out
to<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.360> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> major<00:00:46.350> problem<00:00:46.710> for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
to be kind of a major problem for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.639 
to be kind of a major problem for
android<00:00:47.399> gaming<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:47.940> Real<00:00:48.840> Racing<00:00:49.050> 3<00:00:49.260> for

android gaming because Real Racing 3 for

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.470 
android gaming because Real Racing 3 for
example<00:00:50.070> requires<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.850> over<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.300> point

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
example requires just over one point

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
example requires just over one point
seven<00:00:51.840> gigs<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.430> fully<00:00:53.430> free<00:00:53.789> flash<00:00:54.090> memory

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
seven gigs of fully free flash memory

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.310 
seven gigs of fully free flash memory
and<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.050> actually<00:00:55.879> 2d<00:00:56.879> install<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.629> bunch<00:00:58.170> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and I had actually 2d install a bunch of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
and I had actually 2d install a bunch of
apps<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.039> phone<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.120> room

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
apps on this phone to actually make room

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.889 
apps on this phone to actually make room
for<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:02.039> game<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.629> into

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
for the game because if you go into

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.640 
for the game because if you go into
settings<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:05.070> into<00:01:05.339> memory<00:01:06.330> you'll<00:01:07.320> see

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
settings and go into memory you'll see

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.920 
settings and go into memory you'll see
that<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.970> 120<00:01:09.900> Meg's<00:01:10.439> left<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
that now I only have 120 Meg's left and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
that now I only have 120 Meg's left and
overall<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.170> only<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.770> point<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.909> seven

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
overall there's only two point one seven

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.070 
overall there's only two point one seven
gigs<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.790> memory<00:01:18.150> available<00:01:18.299> there

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
gigs of the memory available there

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.330 
gigs of the memory available there
onboard<00:01:19.409> memory<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> can't<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
onboard memory and you can't really

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.090 
onboard memory and you can't really
install<00:01:20.790> apps<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.390> games<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.530> SD<00:01:23.070> card

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
install apps or games on the SD card

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.690 
install apps or games on the SD card
because<00:01:24.350> Android<00:01:25.460> doesn't<00:01:26.460> allow<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
because Android doesn't allow that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.499 
because Android doesn't allow that
anymore<00:01:27.119> since<00:01:27.540> KitKat<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:29.759> case<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.240> had

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
anymore since KitKat so in my case I had

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
anymore since KitKat so in my case I had
to<00:01:30.840> kick<00:01:31.470> everything<00:01:31.770> else<00:01:32.070> off<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to kick everything else off just to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.289 
to kick everything else off just to
install<00:01:33.000> Real<00:01:33.810> Racing<00:01:34.049> 3<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
install Real Racing 3 so you have to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
install Real Racing 3 so you have to
keep<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.780> mind<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.470> trying<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> install

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
keep that in mind when trying to install

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
keep that in mind when trying to install
games<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.540> even<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.020> if

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
games on here and I don't even know if

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
games on here and I don't even know if
Grand<00:01:40.710> Theft<00:01:40.860> Auto<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.460> example<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.360> even

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
Grand Theft Auto for example will even

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
Grand Theft Auto for example will even
install<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.520> memory

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
install because of the little memory

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.260 
install because of the little memory
that<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.450> guy<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:46.399> has<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:48.000> so

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that this guy actually has right here so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
that this guy actually has right here so
Real<00:01:48.479> Racing<00:01:48.659> 3<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.200> probably<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.860> well

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
Real Racing 3 is probably pretty well

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
Real Racing 3 is probably pretty well
known<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.619> a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.050 
takes a while to load the game and to
start<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> everything<00:02:10.170> else<00:02:10.430> but<00:02:11.430> it's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
start it and everything else but it's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.280 
start it and everything else but it's
pretty<00:02:12.270> common<00:02:12.480> for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
pretty common for

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.979 
pretty common for
Racing<00:02:13.680> three<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.239> little<00:02:15.450> slower<00:02:15.719> than

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
Racing three it's a little slower than

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.890 
Racing three it's a little slower than
on<00:02:16.349> high-end<00:02:17.069> devices<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.629> mean<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
on high-end devices like I mean the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.199 
on high-end devices like I mean the
loading<00:02:19.200> times<00:02:19.439> but<00:02:20.159> gameplay<00:02:20.640> itself<00:02:20.969> is

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
loading times but gameplay itself is

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.330 
loading times but gameplay itself is
pretty<00:02:21.569> smooth<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.560> haven't<00:02:22.859> noticed<00:02:23.040> any

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
pretty smooth and I haven't noticed any

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.160 
pretty smooth and I haven't noticed any
stuttering<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.849> anything<00:02:24.049> even<00:02:25.049> though

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
stuttering or anything even though

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
stuttering or anything even though
there's<00:02:25.409> plenty<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:26.010> opponents<00:02:26.700> around<00:02:26.790> me

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
there's plenty of opponents around me

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.679 
there's plenty of opponents around me
right<00:02:27.269> now

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
right now

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.920 
right now
so<00:02:28.650> Real<00:02:29.010> Racing<00:02:29.189> 3<00:02:29.400> shouldn't<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.090> much<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so Real Racing 3 shouldn't be much of a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
so Real Racing 3 shouldn't be much of a
problem<00:02:31.230> with<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> Moto<00:02:32.099> e<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.819> got

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
problem with the Moto e so now I got

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
problem with the Moto e so now I got
Grand<00:02:33.540> Theft<00:02:33.659> Auto<00:02:33.840> 3<00:02:34.200> running<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:34.709> here

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
Grand Theft Auto 3 running right here

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
Grand Theft Auto 3 running right here
and<00:02:35.069> right<00:02:35.189> now<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.579> set<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.150> absolutely

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
and right now it's set to the absolutely

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.699 
and right now it's set to the absolutely
highest<00:02:37.379> graphics<00:02:37.890> settings<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:40.170> tends<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
highest graphics settings it tends to

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.699 
highest graphics settings it tends to
start<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.099> bit<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.750> stuff<00:02:43.500> that's

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
start a bit because of the stuff that's

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.699 
start a bit because of the stuff that's
far<00:02:43.950> away<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.659> so<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.689> buildings<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.500> in

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
far away and so the buildings in the in

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.580 
far away and so the buildings in the in
the<00:02:46.799> distance<00:02:47.129> are<00:02:47.310> only<00:02:48.000> getting<00:02:48.590> displayed

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the distance are only getting displayed

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.920 
the distance are only getting displayed
after<00:02:50.069> time<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.579> when<00:02:51.389> there's<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.629> bunch<00:02:51.780> of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
after time and when there's a bunch of

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.979 
after time and when there's a bunch of
buildings<00:02:52.919> around<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.700> starts<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.569> stutter<00:02:54.840> a

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
buildings around it starts to stutter a

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.159 
buildings around it starts to stutter a
tiny<00:02:55.290> bit<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:56.579> still<00:02:56.730> playable<00:02:57.329> but<00:02:58.019> you

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
tiny bit it's still playable but you

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.690 
tiny bit it's still playable but you
might<00:02:58.379> want<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.620> reduce<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.310> graphics

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
might want to reduce the graphics

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.339 
might want to reduce the graphics
settings<00:02:59.849> because<00:03:00.150> when<00:03:00.450> you've<00:03:00.569> gone<00:03:00.750> down<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
settings because when you've gone down a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.460 
settings because when you've gone down a
bit<00:03:01.829> like<00:03:02.459> lowered<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.239> distance<00:03:04.639> and<00:03:06.470> also

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
bit like lowered the distance and also

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.770 
bit like lowered the distance and also
lowered<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.919> effects<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.489> stuff<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.569> will

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
lowered the effects and stuff it will

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.899 
lowered the effects and stuff it will
probably<00:03:10.230> run<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.709> bit<00:03:10.919> better<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:11.579> right<00:03:11.760> now

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
probably run a bit better but right now

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.119 
probably run a bit better but right now
it's<00:03:12.090> definitely<00:03:12.269> playable<00:03:12.930> at<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.709> settings

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
it's definitely playable at the settings

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.649 
it's definitely playable at the settings
and<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.549> these<00:03:14.730> are<00:03:14.909> definitely<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
and that these are definitely the

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.979 
and that these are definitely the
highest<00:03:16.079> settings<00:03:16.609> so<00:03:17.609> Brenton<00:03:18.629> we're<00:03:18.900> in

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
highest settings so Brenton we're in

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.189 
highest settings so Brenton we're in
Theft<00:03:19.139> Auto<00:03:19.229> 3<00:03:19.500> also<00:03:19.949> very<00:03:20.849> nicely<00:03:21.239> playable

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
Theft Auto 3 also very nicely playable

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.270 
Theft Auto 3 also very nicely playable
on<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:24.000> Moto<00:03:24.209> e<00:03:24.479> except<00:03:25.169> for<00:03:25.379> one<00:03:25.650> thing<00:03:25.829> that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
on the Moto e except for one thing that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.689 
on the Moto e except for one thing that
the<00:03:26.579> screen<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.030> only<00:03:27.269> 4.3<00:03:27.989> inches<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.699> it's

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
the screen is only 4.3 inches and it's

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.809 
the screen is only 4.3 inches and it's
kind<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:29.940> hard<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.479> steer<00:03:30.989> with<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:32.069> on-screen

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
kind of hard to steer with the on-screen

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.559 
kind of hard to steer with the on-screen
controls<00:03:33.139> having<00:03:34.139> fingers<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.790> are<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.239> bit

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
controls having fingers that are a bit

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.189 
controls having fingers that are a bit
bigger<00:03:37.169> than<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.620> average<00:03:37.669> so<00:03:38.669> yeah<00:03:39.329> that<00:03:40.049> was

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
bigger than the average so yeah that was

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.379 
bigger than the average so yeah that was
a<00:03:40.260> Grand<00:03:40.620> Theft<00:03:40.739> Auto<00:03:40.889> 3<00:03:41.159> on<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> Moto<00:03:41.669> e<00:03:41.940> so

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
a Grand Theft Auto 3 on the Moto e so

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.719 
a Grand Theft Auto 3 on the Moto e so
this<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.750> dead<00:03:43.079> trigger<00:03:43.319> 2<00:03:43.440> on<00:03:43.949> the<00:03:44.220> Moto<00:03:44.489> e

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
this is dead trigger 2 on the Moto e

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.539 
this is dead trigger 2 on the Moto e
right<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.500> I've<00:03:46.500> set<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.919> again<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
right here and I've set it again to the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.110 
right here and I've set it again to the
highest<00:03:48.030> possible<00:03:48.540> settings<00:03:49.159> it<00:03:50.159> does<00:03:50.790> tend

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
highest possible settings it does tend

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.319 
highest possible settings it does tend
to<00:03:51.239> stutter<00:03:51.599> a<00:03:51.840> tiny<00:03:52.199> bit<00:03:52.440> when<00:03:52.650> there's<00:03:53.329> more

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
to stutter a tiny bit when there's more

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.379 
to stutter a tiny bit when there's more
zombies<00:03:55.169> running<00:03:55.709> around<00:03:57.769> but<00:03:58.879> yeah<00:03:59.879> overall

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
zombies running around but yeah overall

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.629 
zombies running around but yeah overall
it's<00:04:01.019> doing<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> pretty<00:04:01.799> good<00:04:01.889> job<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.489> might

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
it's doing a pretty good job you might

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.729 
it's doing a pretty good job you might
want<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.849> set<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> lower<00:04:03.540> setting<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
want to set it to a lower setting to the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.909 
want to set it to a lower setting to the

lower high res or not as many detail
setting<00:04:11.540> but<00:04:12.540> overall<00:04:13.139> it's<00:04:13.409> still<00:04:13.590> playable

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919

on<00:04:14.569> maximum<00:04:15.569> settings<00:04:16.070> it's<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.519> bit<00:04:17.789> more

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
on maximum settings it's just a bit more

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.009 
on maximum settings it's just a bit more

all and if you set the graphic settings
to<00:04:51.860> medium<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.460> should<00:04:53.760> definitely<00:04:54.210> work

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
to medium that should definitely work

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.320 
to medium that should definitely work
out<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:54.990> now<00:04:55.410> I'm<00:04:55.560> playing<00:04:56.330> Shadowgun

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330

deadzone<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:58.110> yeah<00:04:59.040> I<00:04:59.250> tend<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.669> get<00:04:59.850> killed<00:05:00.150> a

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
deadzone and yeah I tend to get killed a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.670 
deadzone and yeah I tend to get killed a
lot<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:00.660> game<00:05:02.600> I've<00:05:03.600> again<00:05:04.140> set<00:05:04.410> it<00:05:04.530> to

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
lot in that game I've again set it to

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.380 
lot in that game I've again set it to
ultra<00:05:05.100> high<00:05:05.220> settings<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.880> case

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
ultra high settings in this case

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.690 
ultra high settings in this case
so<00:05:06.840> always<00:05:07.290> maximum<00:05:08.040> maxing<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:08.820> stuff<00:05:09.060> out

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
so always maximum maxing this stuff out

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.850 
so always maximum maxing this stuff out
pretty<00:05:11.700> nicely<00:05:11.970> playable<00:05:12.540> I'm<00:05:12.840> surprised<00:05:13.680> it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
pretty nicely playable I'm surprised it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.480 
pretty nicely playable I'm surprised it
doesn't<00:05:14.010> really<00:05:14.520> stutter<00:05:16.190> only<00:05:17.190> when<00:05:17.340> other

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
doesn't really stutter only when other

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.330 
doesn't really stutter only when other
players<00:05:17.730> come<00:05:18.180> into<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.510> game<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:19.230> will<00:05:19.560> tend

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
players come into the game it will tend

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.190 
players come into the game it will tend
to<00:05:20.460> stutter<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.850> bit<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.330> when<00:05:21.720> there's<00:05:21.960> like

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
to stutter a bit and when there's like

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.740 
to stutter a bit and when there's like
special<00:05:22.620> effects<00:05:22.860> going<00:05:23.100> on<00:05:23.390> for<00:05:24.390> example

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
special effects going on for example

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.680 
special effects going on for example
yeah<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:27.990> lot<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.320> blood<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.800> spilt<00:05:29.690> it

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
yeah but a lot of blood is spilt it

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.350 
yeah but a lot of blood is spilt it
tends<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.380> slow<00:05:31.740> it<00:05:31.860> down<00:05:31.890> a<00:05:32.040> bit<00:05:32.310> but<00:05:33.000> overall

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
tends to slow it down a bit but overall

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.350 
tends to slow it down a bit but overall
very<00:05:33.510> playable<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.530> will<00:05:34.740> even<00:05:35.040> add<00:05:35.360> super

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
very playable you will even add super

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.120 
very playable you will even add super
high<00:05:36.479> settings<00:05:36.900> here<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.320> here<00:05:37.740> we<00:05:37.860> have<00:05:37.979> the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
high settings here so here we have the

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.940 
high settings here so here we have the
classic<00:05:38.370> Riptide<00:05:39.060> gp2<00:05:39.450> and<00:05:40.200> I've<00:05:40.320> also<00:05:40.500> set<00:05:40.830> it

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
classic Riptide gp2 and I've also set it

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.600

to the highest possible settings and it

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.230 
to the highest possible settings and it
seems<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.180> be<00:05:45.710> totally<00:05:46.710> playable<00:05:47.400> definitely

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
seems to be totally playable definitely

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.820 
seems to be totally playable definitely
no<00:05:48.390> problems<00:05:49.200> at<00:05:49.380> all

no problems at all

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.250 
no problems at all
there<00:05:50.760> might<00:05:51.000> be<00:05:51.030> some<00:05:51.510> cases<00:05:51.930> when<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
there might be some cases when the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.350 
there might be some cases when the
effects<00:05:52.680> kick<00:05:52.890> in<00:05:53.040> for<00:05:53.340> example<00:05:53.610> of<00:05:53.790> splashing

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
effects kick in for example of splashing

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.260 
effects kick in for example of splashing
water<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:55.140> stuff<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:56.340> might<00:05:56.700> slow<00:05:56.970> down<00:05:57.240> a

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
water and stuff that might slow down a

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.600 
water and stuff that might slow down a
bit<00:05:57.419> but<00:05:57.720> right<00:05:57.870> now<00:05:58.050> seems<00:05:58.680> very<00:05:59.370> nicely

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
bit but right now seems very nicely

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.909 
bit but right now seems very nicely
playable<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.419> use<00:06:01.020> both<00:06:01.260> fingers<00:06:01.470> on<00:06:01.800> this<00:06:03.919> so
