just think that we shouldn't be doing

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810 
just think that we shouldn't be doing
the<00:01:49.229> same<00:01:49.410> thing<00:01:49.650> over<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> over<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.490> we

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the same thing over and over because we

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
the same thing over and over because we

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
we been getting the same results so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.770
