I<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.059> wills<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> yellow<00:00:58.640> white<00:00:59.640> yeah

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
I don't think wills a yellow white yeah

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.860 
I don't think wills a yellow white yeah
well<00:01:02.190> we'll<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.359> come<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.600> okay

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
well we'll see when they come out okay

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
well we'll see when they come out okay
okay<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.979> they're<00:01:05.100> actually<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.369> three

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
okay so they're actually about three

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
okay so they're actually about three
days<00:01:05.880> early<00:01:06.420> starting<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> hatch<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.830> guess

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
days early starting to hatch but I guess

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.510 
days early starting to hatch but I guess
that's<00:01:08.250> okay

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that's okay

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310 
that's okay
either<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.119> had<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> turned<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.750> too<00:01:09.900> high<00:01:10.080> or

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
either we had it turned up too high or

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810 
either we had it turned up too high or
they<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.650> hatched<00:01:10.799> faster<00:01:11.220> than<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.460> thought

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
they just hatched faster than we thought

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.429 
they just hatched faster than we thought

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
in the shell there were three so instead

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.180 
in the shell there were three so instead
of<00:06:06.169> letting<00:06:06.320> that<00:06:06.500> happen<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.860> other<00:06:07.010> two

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.250 
of letting that happen to the other two
which<00:06:07.430> we're<00:06:07.760> not<00:06:07.940> moving<00:06:08.450> very<00:06:08.660> much<00:06:08.750> I

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
which we're not moving very much I

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.200 
which we're not moving very much I
peeled<00:06:09.710> them<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:10.010> lot<00:06:10.250> of<00:06:10.370> sites<00:06:10.760> you<00:06:10.850> look<00:06:11.060> at

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210

peeled them a lot of sites you look at
will<00:06:11.360> advise<00:06:11.660> against<00:06:12.229> doing<00:06:12.260> that<00:06:12.500> for

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
will advise against doing that for

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.260 
will advise against doing that for
chicken<00:06:13.130> red<00:06:13.190> chickens<00:06:13.610> or<00:06:13.820> anything<00:06:14.030> you're

chicken red chickens or anything you're
raising<00:06:14.419> in<00:06:14.630> an<00:06:14.750> incubator<00:06:15.050> but<00:06:15.440> I<00:06:15.500> thought

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
raising in an incubator but I thought

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.200 
raising in an incubator but I thought
well<00:06:16.159> if<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.370> choice<00:06:16.550> is<00:06:16.580> letting<00:06:16.909> I'm<00:06:16.970> dying

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
well if the choice is letting I'm dying

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.880 
well if the choice is letting I'm dying
in<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.390> egg<00:06:17.539> or<00:06:17.810> possibly<00:06:18.440> die<00:06:18.620> when<00:06:18.800> I'm

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
in the egg or possibly die when I'm

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.340 
in the egg or possibly die when I'm
peeling

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
peeling

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.590 
peeling
I<00:06:19.380> will<00:06:19.980> take<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.550> chance<00:06:20.760> because<00:06:21.000> if<00:06:21.420> I

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
I will take the chance because if I

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.820 
I will take the chance because if I
don't<00:06:21.660> do<00:06:21.870> anything<00:06:22.080> there's<00:06:22.350> die<00:06:22.470> in<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:22.680> egg

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
don't do anything there's die in the egg

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.790 
don't do anything there's die in the egg
