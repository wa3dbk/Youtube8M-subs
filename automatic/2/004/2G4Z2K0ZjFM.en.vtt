daughters are not the fifth generation
and<00:00:13.040> we<00:00:14.040> started<00:00:14.340> getting<00:00:14.730> serious<00:00:15.210> about

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and we started getting serious about

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.570 
and we started getting serious about
planting<00:00:15.839> trees<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.289> they're<00:00:16.470> 10<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:17.340> 12

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
planting trees that they're 10 or 12

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.660 
planting trees that they're 10 or 12
years<00:00:17.609> ago<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.270> since<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.470> which<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.980> land

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
years ago and since in which that land

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
years ago and since in which that land
there<00:00:20.850> -<00:00:21.029> there's<00:00:21.240> 15<00:00:22.109> percent<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
there - there's 15 percent of the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.140 
there - there's 15 percent of the
landscape<00:00:24.800> I'm<00:00:25.800> standing<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.490> chicory<00:00:26.880> crop

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
landscape I'm standing out chicory crop

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.390 
landscape I'm standing out chicory crop
and<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.349> chicory<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.740> plantain

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and it's actually chicory and plantain

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.800 
and it's actually chicory and plantain
and<00:00:29.429> clover<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> bit<00:00:30.300> arrived<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.750> us

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and clover and a bit arrived for us

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.680 
and clover and a bit arrived for us
which<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.349> finishing<00:00:31.859> our<00:00:31.980> lands<00:00:32.690> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
which we use for finishing our lands and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.000 
which we use for finishing our lands and
that's<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> tree<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.559> done<00:00:34.710> them<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that's where the tree is done them to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.729 
that's where the tree is done them to
because<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:35.309> complement<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:35.969> program<00:00:36.739> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because they complement this program and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.860 
because they complement this program and
also<00:00:38.010> protecting<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.120> crop<00:00:39.420> from<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> hot

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
also protecting this crop from the hot

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.569 
also protecting this crop from the hot
key<00:00:40.020> northerly<00:00:40.350> winds<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> doesn't<00:00:41.430> dry

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
key northerly winds so that doesn't dry

out<00:00:41.610> during<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> summer<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.710> think<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.800> using

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
out during the summer I think of using

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
out during the summer I think of using
commercial<00:00:45.360> trees<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> habitat<00:00:46.079> trees<00:00:46.379> as

we<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.950> assured<00:02:04.280> income<00:02:04.689> but<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.899> next

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
we have assured income but the next

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.259 
we have assured income but the next
generation<00:02:06.250> they'll<00:02:07.250> gain<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.640> benefits<00:02:08.090> of

generation they'll gain the benefits of

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.330 
generation they'll gain the benefits of
harvesting<00:02:09.049> those<00:02:09.229> trees<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.920> then

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
harvesting those trees and then

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.989 
harvesting those trees and then
