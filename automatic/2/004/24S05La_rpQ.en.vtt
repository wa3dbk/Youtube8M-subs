 guilherme and in the area with another gamer 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.840
 point and unfortunately the trade with a 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.850
 bad news in relation to the ante az 4 mas 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.600
 Calm down that it may be good news. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.689
 if we analyze for another aspect 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.599
 following the game was unfortunately postponed 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.649
 expected to arrive in that year now he 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.070
 should only go the distance in 2016 through 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.800
 a post on the official playstation blog 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.980
 they regretted the postponement but said 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 that the game needs to be perfect 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.350
 impeccable 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.590
 they intend to pay attention to each 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.949
 detail every good nuance then only the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.110
 left to wait even right play you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.559
 you use these 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.359
 streaming videos in your video game 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.480
 currently a lot of people use ne 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.240
 but since it then would be back there 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.310
 The little nintendinho is what you will see 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.880
 in this video now 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.040
 this because two netflix programmers 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.860
 decided to create a service version 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.509
 pro old nintendo console that has been 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.600
 released in 1985 the result obviously 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.720
 not the best but curious to see and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 think how technology has evolved from 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 Right here. 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.470
 and if you have an xbox one and want 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 try the game drago neide 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 including chan, this is your chance 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.430
 run 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.649
 this is because until March 16 the game 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 will be available for free to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.070
 all those who have a gold account in the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.140
 live 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.420
 there is also a recession that does not 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.369
 to play more than six hours 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.009
 but let's agree it's already a good time 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.680
 you can easily decide if 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.750
 buy or not the game then run and 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 enjoy 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.670
 and with all this wave of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.819
 virtual reality a galera stopped 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 thought the following and the smell of things 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.319
 how to pass the odors through 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.099
 of 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.299
 the good handset now this is possible 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.450
 the mask can initially 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:24.379
 transmit the scent of the oceans of the jungle 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.409
 fire flowers and metal and this mask if the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.870
 with the glasses on the side of the 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.810
 below the face specifically in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.560
 mouth still conveys the sensation of 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.540
 Wind Tai O is most lacking and invent and 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.049

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.480

 development of the game said he 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.980
 leave the player in control of the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.349
 situation most of the time with 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.989
 this daycare should be in a number 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.959
 very small they are betting on it 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.449
