00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.539
 and before we start let's go 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.670
 our already very traditional traditional 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.140
 now it's everyone thousands of messages 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.390
 Paul also hints at asking for a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 save us 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 I'll pass the ball to Lucas where I go. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 Ask you a question for him. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 Lucas Tell me some of this story, tell me 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 how you got good staff is a lot of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.160
 People do not know but I'm a genius of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.590
 computing with the vulgar nerd 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.210
 nerdiness this medium and this way means 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.039
 I'm not as talkative as I'm promised. 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.780
 Alan 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.430
 I'm a computer engineer who 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 who gave up halfway and turned 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 Photographer college I had a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.170
 colleague who was a photographer but 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 pursuit of the profession of photographer 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.650
 he had a dslr at a time when 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.140
 nobody had to be and none is a 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.509
 common normal person so it was not a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.799
 photographer himself had to be he made the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.350
 bullshit to take his camera to a 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.159
 barbecue the group ready already gave the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.930
 what had to give 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.939
 My father gave me some money to take away 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.000
 driver's license or the bicycle 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 pressure is being a story for 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.040
 take a driver 's license and I bought 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:57.299
 a sony camera to a nearby camera that has 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.890
 more bridge names and there a result 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.219
 with the camera and to this day 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219
 Wallet 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.600
 We would be the father still well, people at 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.759
 streets are already too dangerous right 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:20.900
 I do not know even when he walked 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:28.460
 kart position got the psg stayed in ninth 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:31.700
 in the sixth step and the third to the question 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.820
 What should she do now is not 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.260
 I paid attention in his story he 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.790
 said how did it start not he said 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.080
 how is the first camera he 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.180
 He did not tell me how he got started. 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.050
 look at the test already said look no 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.770
 I said good, I started taking photos. 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.300
 insight 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.870
 I was a scientific initiation fellow. 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.190
 in college and at the time paid absurdities 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.310
 Of money 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.690
 I earned 300 reais a month for you 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.940
 scientific research 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.730
 then passed to 3 60 and today should be 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.840
 450 and earning 300 reais per month is 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.180
 impossible to buy a dslr 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.739
 so what I did started working 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.600
 with photography 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.950
 the new borrowed camera do a test 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.260
 here is there 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.140
 I started doing this testing 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.760
 friends and such a new sentence 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.709
 other colleagues want to photograph something 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:29.360
 further testing is to record a recording and 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.090
 photographing the test and if I went there and was 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.739
 The first one this way then 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 I started by leaps and bounds 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.830
 because I liked to photograph 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.989
 people software and then I bought one 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.060
 camera with the money of these 30 small 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.110
 works in others but attends a 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.610
 Question I bought my camera and now 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.680
 take the course that is actually the name of the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.370
 basic school photography course I 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.890
 I bought a camera and now I've learned 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.590
 I have learned the basics by 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.530
 netinha account friends that helped and such and 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.030
 gives to learn alone but who knows 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.720
 want to learn by right account 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.720
 engineer 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.920
 in the morning but it's that thing 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.470
 that you have and have a sample of 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.660
 cost self - taught can learn 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.910
 takes a little bit more sometimes it's more 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.460
 easy to track the atelier for the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.290
 pounds success is the trail of one of a 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:34.730
 teacher giving the paths right 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.730
 this is the ideal lucas is a lousy 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.580
 but then lucas this is the ideal way to 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.550
 lucas start a profession is not okay 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.410
 why not because when everything starts to 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.670
 do things on your own without paying attention 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.100
 I made many mistakes 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.870
 My god is interesting to say when 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.520
 can learn from them when I take 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.700
 do if you make those mistakes and take 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.420
 It's bad and I'm not saying I got to take 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.110
 at the 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.490
 because of the sky but if I had 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.500
 started in the ideal way that I 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.100
 I think it's taking a course 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.050
 for this area being an assistant to a 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.850
 fashion photographer for example is the 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.030
 which I think is ideal for 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.560
 to start in this field because it is ideal if 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.540
 assistant of a fashion photographer 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.460
 because you learn all the flow of 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.430
 work of the photographer that they would 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.920
 to vote I've been experienced he already knows 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.270
 manage the teams he already knows how 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.150
 a set of shooting and photography works 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.950
 he knows how he drives a model alone. 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.020
 to watch a role was working to 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.130
 people can already learn from 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.930
 watch for those who have a little bit of a 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.150
 percentage of self - generation as 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.730
 teacher in college said he knows if 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.130
 turn from looking already if I already learned to 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.780
 to assimilate what he has knowledge of 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.270
 to then work from 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.650
 for a year and a half 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.450
 six months can suddenly seize 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.120
 minimum of the basic flow of a 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.419
 rehearsal photographer 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.199
 fashion is the ideal way to start 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.620
 in this area 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:25.150
 ideal way is not only 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.150
 down an 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.900
 I took a long time, for example. 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.540
 start shooting in the studio because 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.610
 I did not have a studio and I did not 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.040
 rent a studio that is is relatively 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.930
 expensive studio rental and has a studio 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.600
 I have that account every month to 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.449
 pay for this job as an assistant 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.180
 photographer in the vague time of being of that 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:50.150
 study can go there to do tests to do 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.430
 learn about light can study about 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.520
 light to improve work for 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.930
 improve even your boss's work 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.080
 assistant editor 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.900
 is to know how to help him in a better way 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.070
 So I consider the way of class and in the 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.169
 next block we will talk about what 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.150
 things I would do differently, if I 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.060
 began today in fashion photography 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.270
 photographing the test is also linked to 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.270
 she
