00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.800
 hot plan of session I'll show you 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.800
 today the Taylor 618 first edition 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.929
 yes i have the 618 of taylor in here 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.530
 the hand and it is the first 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.030
 edition 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 but it also explains what it is 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 means and I would be very short 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.649
 want to tell at that time about the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.020
 checker and although the entire guitar has 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.890
 Maple back and sides and I think 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.380
 that fished 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.619
 the blanket is dark it's because of that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.390
 that because the blanket is baked that is 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.069
 a method of taylor was introduced 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.170
 but it was something else 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.479
 Manufacturers simply make things better 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.319
 has come out of the wood out a 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.239
 very light wood and does not have that much 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.520
 bass share such as present 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.289
 or other woods and over the ceiling 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.579
 want that taylor a bit again 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.569
 rausholen what is also very successful 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.860
 So I have to say how to do it 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.009
 maybe just heard right now 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.220
 in the example, the best were already very much 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.569
 very briefly fly over the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 then I explain one more guitar 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.760
 little to the construction we have 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.060
 Here in just wooden handle rose here is whether 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.079
 the new expert system 2 has been installed 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.790
 also explained again as the 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.239
 works then we have one here 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.519
 pick up a rosewood then a peel 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.440
 on education 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.359
 then we have the fingerboard here 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.019
 ebony here are the inlays too 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.850
 are present only in the princely 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.670
 and then we have the hotplate on top 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.880
 with the company name and also the first 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.980
 edition logo what is first edition 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.440
 means the guitar is limited to 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.519
 a number which is now exclusive 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.030
 comes out and then goes completely in 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.030
 series 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.669
 we have the control panel up here 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.220
 the pickup that would be here 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:08.169
 volume travel &amp; bass now we go up 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.590
 the back really insane 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:14.349
 Looks good through this maple 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.030
 was darkly wrapped 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.130
 probably 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.120
 and it looks awesome, too 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.389
 here at some cent long very noble 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.019
 then we have the neck of mahogany and 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.639
 every the back of the hotplate too 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.840
 with this logo for the first edition 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.370
 the mechanics of taylor made of chrome 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.280
 to the neck very briefly that's it too 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.040
 procedure of taylor that all necks at 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.859
 which three parts are also bolted 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.739
 has the advantage should any 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.390
 service problems do not seem to know 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.129
 the hotplate breaks off or something 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.609
 not true in the neck then taylor 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.349
 exchange it one to one and do it 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.700
 not unlearned and therefore by that 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.340
 this is a bit of a criminal case 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.209
 kept simpler yes again back to 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.470
 construction of the guitar andy powers has the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.189
 guitar designed completely and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.040
 revised for taylor 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.200
 we have another racing drum here 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.410
 screwed around and for him was just 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.180
 the task he wanted from the maple wood 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.820
 neck one also sounded a very different 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.509
 somehow get out or the whole new 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.520
 discover 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.310
 we hear the whole thing is synonymous again 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.199
 from the west is beatable one 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.750
 two more chords and then 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:34.250
 I explain the sound customer and then 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.250
 he is normal reinforced 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.469
 So the basses are absolutely amazing 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.569
 and the whole thing totally dynamic so 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.270
 More can be streaming as well 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.879
 make hanger for him it 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.879
 that's just the demand of the 66 18 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.919
 that is very flexible she is also very 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.639
 loud you have to say if we 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.110
 goes right in and yes only a short time ago 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.629
 has a system to come up with the new one 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.759
 expert system two is yes again 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.740
 in the page system but not under the 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.219
 is bridge but behind the stands that 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.639
 we have three petsos here 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:31.039
 each two pages are distributed and 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.409
 which can then be set ever 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.509
 after strength forward to back like 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.369
 strong the sound now comes or does not have 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.409
 the advantage is easier to set 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:43.209
 if it is under the saddle was too 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:46.789
 the idea of â€‹â€‹taylor that one tries 

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:50.659
 to counteract that one does not 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:53.089
 always grind the saddle so the 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.699
 stegner must grind around then it 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.529
 Balanced sounds are very good idea 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.479
 sounds very good that would be the 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:02.649
 Next point we now tackle 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.649
 just how hidden are 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:35.050
 So the guitar itself is the absolute 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.120
 Prove that Taylor is not afraid at all 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.289
 also has new ways to go around that 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.250
 really authentic 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:44.740
 can be a very into the instrument 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.419
 I would fan every plate or too 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.039
 Meat of interest has my film 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.870
 to come by playing the whole of 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.759
 to convince yourself how good 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.490
 also this whole 600 series too 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:57.879
 Edit sounds like yes I would say 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.379
 We also have in store and you 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.400
 You can come by and try it 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.400
 just out
