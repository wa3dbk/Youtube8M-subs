now store so here's the box did take

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.950 
now store so here's the box did take
about<00:00:08.010> two<00:00:08.309> weeks<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.610> get<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.750> came

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
about two weeks to get here and it came

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.830 
about two weeks to get here and it came
from<00:00:10.200> HK<00:00:10.800> now<00:00:11.070> store<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.849> let's<00:00:12.330> open<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.929> up

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.050 

so<00:00:18.840> here's<00:00:19.080> Calvin's<00:00:19.619> 3<00:00:19.890> by<00:00:20.010> 3<00:00:20.160> by<00:00:20.340> 5<00:00:20.520> cuboid

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
so here's Calvin's 3 by 3 by 5 cuboid

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730 
so here's Calvin's 3 by 3 by 5 cuboid
and<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> puzzle<00:00:21.930> I've<00:00:22.199> been<00:00:22.410> really

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and this is a puzzle I've been really

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.540 
and this is a puzzle I've been really
looking<00:00:23.400> forward<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:25.260> enjoy<00:00:25.859> my<00:00:26.189> 3

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
looking forward to I really enjoy my 3

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.269 
looking forward to I really enjoy my 3
by<00:00:26.640> 3<00:00:26.789> by<00:00:27.000> 5<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> made<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.230> probably<00:00:28.769> one

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
by 3 by 5 that I made it's probably one

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
by 3 by 5 that I made it's probably one
of<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.460> favorite<00:00:29.910> puzzles<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:30.570> time<00:00:30.840> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of my favorite puzzles of all time and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319 
of my favorite puzzles of all time and
so<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.980> wondering<00:00:32.219> why<00:00:32.640> no<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:33.059> had

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so I was wondering why no one had

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.750 
so I was wondering why no one had
mass-produced<00:00:34.050> ones<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
mass-produced ones but now we do have a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.930 
mass-produced ones but now we do have a
mass-produced<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.260> open<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:40.940> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
mass-produced one so let's open it up so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.279 
mass-produced one so let's open it up so
let's<00:00:42.390> turn<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.309> can<00:00:44.309> tell<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.940> been

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
let's turn it I can tell that it's been

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
let's turn it I can tell that it's been
lubricated<00:00:46.289> already<00:00:49.610> mine's<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.149> bit

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
lubricated already mine's a little bit

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.920 
lubricated already mine's a little bit
catchy<00:00:54.379> right<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> box<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.840> see

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
catchy right out of the box you can see

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
catchy right out of the box you can see
me<00:00:58.289> turn<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.770> side<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.460> catches

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
me turn this side and then it catches

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.009 
me turn this side and then it catches
right<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.760> four<00:01:02.969> moves<00:01:03.149> over<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.629> bet<00:01:03.809> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
right here the four moves over I bet you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.550 
right here the four moves over I bet you
though<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.439> clears<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> far<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.470> not

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
though that clears up so far it's not

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
though that clears up so far it's not
bad<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> same<00:01:09.360> time<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:11.460> hasn't<00:01:12.119> been

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
bad but at the same time it hasn't been

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350 
bad but at the same time it hasn't been
like<00:01:12.510> amazing<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> box<00:01:14.360> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
like amazing right out of the box of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
like amazing right out of the box of
course<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.409> makes<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.740> three<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.040> three<00:01:17.250> by

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
course what makes a three by three by

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.230 
course what makes a three by three by
five<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.729> cool

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
five so cool

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.289 
five so cool
it<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.950> shape-shifting<00:01:19.950> cuboid<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it is a shape-shifting cuboid and you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530 
it is a shape-shifting cuboid and you
can<00:01:21.479> shape-shift<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.509> which<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can shape-shift it like this which is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.580 
can shape-shift it like this which is
really<00:01:25.200> cool<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.000> bizarre<00:01:27.590> solving

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
really cool it's very bizarre solving

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
really cool it's very bizarre solving
the<00:01:28.710> three<00:01:28.890> by<00:01:29.009> three<00:01:29.189> by<00:01:29.220> five<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the three by three by five is just it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
the three by three by five is just it's
a<00:01:30.210> lot<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.479> fun<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.290> why<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
a lot of fun to me I don't know why I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
a lot of fun to me I don't know why I
really<00:01:32.490> enjoy<00:01:32.850> it

really enjoy it
I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.689> cool<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.500> fun

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I think it's cool one thing that's fun

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010 
I think it's cool one thing that's fun
about<00:01:34.710> 3x3<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.460> fives<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.540> patterns<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
about 3x3 by fives are the patterns and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
about 3x3 by fives are the patterns and
you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> made<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> checkerboard

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you can see I made a checkerboard

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
you can see I made a checkerboard
pattern<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> lot<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> cool

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
pattern but you can make a lot of cool

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
pattern but you can make a lot of cool
patterns<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.640> even<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.420> cube<00:01:42.689> in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
patterns you can even do like a cube in

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
patterns you can even do like a cube in
a<00:01:42.840> cube<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> wanted<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
a cube if you wanted to that one can be

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.510 
a cube if you wanted to that one can be
fun

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
fun

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.889 
fun
here's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.610> cube<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.000> cube<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.689> i<00:01:48.840> think

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
here's a cube in a cube which i think

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.340 
here's a cube in a cube which i think
looks<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.439> neat<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.960> course<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
looks really neat and then of course you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
looks really neat and then of course you
can<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> cube<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> cube<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.369> cube<00:01:53.399> let's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
can do a cube in a cube in a cube let's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.200 
can do a cube in a cube in a cube let's
do<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> mess<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.210> there

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
do that a little bit of a mess but there

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.880 
do that a little bit of a mess but there
we<00:01:57.329> go<00:01:57.479> there's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> cube<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> cube<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> cube

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
we go there's a cube in a cube in a cube

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.580 
we go there's a cube in a cube in a cube
it<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.969> guess<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> cuboid<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> cuboid<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it I guess it's a cuboid in a cuboid and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
it I guess it's a cuboid in a cuboid and
the<00:02:01.710> cuboid<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> I've<00:02:03.240> been<00:02:03.360> playing<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the cuboid so I've been playing with the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.080 
the cuboid so I've been playing with the
three<00:02:04.290> by<00:02:04.409> three<00:02:04.590> by<00:02:04.710> five<00:02:04.860> cuboid<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.790> about

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
three by three by five cuboid for about

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.609 
three by three by five cuboid for about
ten<00:02:06.420> minutes<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.960> I've<00:02:07.049> been<00:02:07.229> having<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.530> lot

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
ten minutes and I've been having a lot

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
ten minutes and I've been having a lot
of<00:02:07.680> fun<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.039> remind<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> lot<00:02:09.149> about<00:02:09.330> why

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
of fun with it remind me a lot about why

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.869 
of fun with it remind me a lot about why
I<00:02:09.750> liked<00:02:10.289> my<00:02:10.530> old<00:02:10.560> three<00:02:10.979> by<00:02:11.099> three<00:02:11.280> by<00:02:11.400> five<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
I liked my old three by three by five so

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.000 
I liked my old three by three by five so
much<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.050> fun

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
much is just a lot of fun

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550 
much is just a lot of fun
so<00:02:14.370> once<00:02:14.909> you've<00:02:15.150> scrambled<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:16.049> with<00:02:16.319> just

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so once you've scrambled it up with just

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.920 
so once you've scrambled it up with just
these<00:02:16.680> kind<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.010> cuboid<00:02:17.519> moves<00:02:17.790> then<00:02:18.540> what<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
these kind of cuboid moves then what you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.449 
these kind of cuboid moves then what you
have<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.109> do<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.920> scramble<00:02:20.189> it<00:02:20.400> up

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
have to do is you have to scramble it up

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.229 
have to do is you have to scramble it up
with<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:22.280> shape-shifting<00:02:23.280> moves<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.790> when

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
with these shape-shifting moves and when

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.390 
with these shape-shifting moves and when
you<00:02:24.329> do<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.659> it<00:02:24.930> becomes<00:02:25.109> a<00:02:25.590> big<00:02:25.829> mess<00:02:25.859> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you do that it becomes a big mess and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280 
you do that it becomes a big mess and
you<00:02:26.459> can<00:02:26.519> see<00:02:26.760> how<00:02:26.969> it's<00:02:27.150> turning<00:02:27.390> now<00:02:27.629> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you can see how it's turning now the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.399 
you can see how it's turning now the
puzzle<00:02:28.469> kind<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:28.859> turns<00:02:29.129> into<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.569> 3x3<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.719> so

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
puzzle kind of turns into a 3x3 and so

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.330 
puzzle kind of turns into a 3x3 and so
these<00:02:33.200> extended<00:02:34.200> layers<00:02:34.439> here<00:02:34.739> don't<00:02:35.040> turn

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
these extended layers here don't turn

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.759 
these extended layers here don't turn
now<00:02:35.609> but<00:02:36.209> they<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.659> bandaged<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.469> the<00:02:37.590> layer

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
now but they are bandaged to the layer

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.809 
now but they are bandaged to the layer
below<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.129> kind<00:02:38.609> of<00:02:38.639> like<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.969> it's<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.299> 3x3

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
below it kind of like it it's like a 3x3

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.449 
below it kind of like it it's like a 3x3
anyway<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.090> solving<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> lot<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.349> fun<00:02:43.590> it's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
anyway the solving is a lot of fun it's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.699 
anyway the solving is a lot of fun it's
just<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.939> really<00:02:45.120> cool<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.689> think<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.079> still

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
just it's really cool I think it's still

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.089 
just it's really cool I think it's still
my<00:02:46.980> favorite<00:02:47.579> cuboid<00:02:48.409> because<00:02:49.409> it's<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.739> too

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
my favorite cuboid because it's not too

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.890 
my favorite cuboid because it's not too
hard<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.730> doesn't<00:02:51.150> take<00:02:51.269> too<00:02:51.450> long<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:51.840> not

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
hard it doesn't take too long it's not

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.839 
hard it doesn't take too long it's not
too<00:02:52.169> high<00:02:52.409> having<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.739> hoarder<00:02:53.159> of<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.459> puzzle

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
too high having a hoarder of a puzzle

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.550 
too high having a hoarder of a puzzle
but<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.299> same<00:02:54.480> time<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.379> get<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
but at the same time you get the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.720 
but at the same time you get the
shape-shifting<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.790> get<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.209> difficulty<00:02:58.109> of

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
shape-shifting you get the difficulty of

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.819 
shape-shifting you get the difficulty of
kind<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.790> these<00:03:00.000> shape-shifting<00:03:00.829> puzzles

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
kind of these shape-shifting puzzles

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:02.959 
kind of these shape-shifting puzzles
where<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.219> solve<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.549> first<00:03:02.700> like

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
where you have to solve it first like

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.699 
where you have to solve it first like
one<00:03:03.120> puzzle<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.659> then<00:03:03.780> solve<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.349> second

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
one puzzle and then solve it a second

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.830 
one puzzle and then solve it a second
like<00:03:04.889> a<00:03:04.919> different<00:03:05.310> puzzle<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:06.719> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
like a different puzzle so because of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
like a different puzzle so because of
that<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.379> one<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.799> my<00:03:07.980> favorite<00:03:08.459> cuboids

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
that this is one of my favorite cuboids

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.809 
that this is one of my favorite cuboids
I<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.629> it's<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.959> lot<00:03:10.169> of<00:03:10.200> fun<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.459> what<00:03:11.700> are<00:03:11.790> my

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
I think it's a lot of fun so what are my

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.449 
I think it's a lot of fun so what are my
final<00:03:12.269> thoughts<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.750> 3<00:03:13.439> by<00:03:13.530> 3<00:03:13.560> 4<00:03:13.859> 5<00:03:13.980> cuboid

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
final thoughts on the 3 by 3 4 5 cuboid

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.000 
final thoughts on the 3 by 3 4 5 cuboid
well<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.209> think<00:03:15.359> it's<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.750> lot<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.049> fun<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.650> really

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
well I think it's a lot of fun I really

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.710 
well I think it's a lot of fun I really
like<00:03:17.219> this<00:03:17.430> puzzle<00:03:17.760> writing<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.299> box<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
like this puzzle writing on the box it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.569 
like this puzzle writing on the box it
wasn't<00:03:19.019> turning<00:03:19.229> that<00:03:19.440> great<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:19.889> after<00:03:20.430> just

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
wasn't turning that great but after just

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.550 
wasn't turning that great but after just
a<00:03:20.819> few<00:03:20.879> minutes<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.750> started<00:03:22.079> turning<00:03:22.199> much

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
a few minutes it started turning much

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.759 
a few minutes it started turning much
better<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.760> turns<00:03:24.060> good<00:03:24.329> I<00:03:24.599> love<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.440> three

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
better so it turns good I love the three

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.069 
better so it turns good I love the three
by<00:03:25.889> three<00:03:26.069> by<00:03:26.099> five<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.609> love<00:03:26.849> how<00:03:27.030> how<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.930> is

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
by three by five I love how how it is

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.080 
by three by five I love how how it is
solving<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:28.769> like<00:03:28.949> the<00:03:29.069> perfect<00:03:29.310> cuboid<00:03:29.849> for

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
solving it's like the perfect cuboid for

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.089 
solving it's like the perfect cuboid for
me<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.329> not<00:03:30.479> too<00:03:30.780> high<00:03:31.349> of<00:03:31.500> an<00:03:31.620> order<00:03:31.919> of<00:03:32.010> a

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
me it's not too high of an order of a

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.770 
me it's not too high of an order of a
cuboid<00:03:32.400> where<00:03:32.639> everything's<00:03:32.970> super<00:03:33.150> tedious

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
cuboid where everything's super tedious

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.300 
cuboid where everything's super tedious
and<00:03:34.319> at<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> same<00:03:34.769> time<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.189> get

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and at the same time you get

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.460 
and at the same time you get
shape-shifting<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:36.720> some<00:03:37.319> of<00:03:37.409> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
shape-shifting you get some of the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.140 
shape-shifting you get some of the
difficulties<00:03:38.040> where<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.729> to<00:03:38.879> solve<00:03:39.060> it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
difficulties where you have to solve it
