water will settle off settle down

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.169 
water will settle off settle down
through<00:00:13.469> convection<00:00:13.920> currents<00:00:14.759> it'll<00:00:15.000> come

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
through convection currents it'll come

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.420 
through convection currents it'll come
up<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.480> evaporate<00:00:15.599> off<00:00:19.850> now<00:00:21.740> if<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.920> stir<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
up and evaporate off now if you stir the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
up and evaporate off now if you stir the
water<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.269> top<00:00:54.170> okay<00:00:55.170> usually<00:00:55.770> if

water up to the top okay usually if

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
water up to the top okay usually if
there's<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> lot<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> water<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.480> get

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
there's a lot of water in it we can get

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.439 
there's a lot of water in it we can get
it<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.940> wouldn't<00:00:59.940> believe<00:01:00.059> how

it up here and you wouldn't believe how

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.370 
it up here and you wouldn't believe how
violent<00:01:01.140> it'll<00:01:01.379> boil<00:01:01.680> off<00:01:03.140> Wow<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
soon as it hits the top hits the air it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.140 
soon as it hits the top hits the air it
boils<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:18.259> like<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.380> said<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.880> 237<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
boils right off like I said it's 237 to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.170 
boils right off like I said it's 237 to
40<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:24.540> keep<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.960> heated<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.180> overnight

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
40 I can keep it heated up and overnight

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.890 
40 I can keep it heated up and overnight
let<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> evaporate<00:01:28.380> off<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.509> stir<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
let it evaporate off or I can stir it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.170 
let it evaporate off or I can stir it
and<00:01:31.200> bring<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> water<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> top

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:48.030 

I<00:01:43.920> only<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.460> when<00:01:45.730> I<00:01:45.790> know<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.470> oils<00:01:47.800> been

I only do this when I know the oils been
sitting<00:01:48.490> out<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.030> restaurant<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.710> been

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
sitting out of the restaurant it's been

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.060 
sitting out of the restaurant it's been
raining<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.840> take<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.410> oil<00:01:53.560> from<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
raining when I take the oil from the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.010 
raining when I take the oil from the
bottom<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.760> tote<00:01:55.030> that's<00:01:55.330> been<00:01:55.540> sitting

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
bottom of a tote that's been sitting

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.040 
bottom of a tote that's been sitting
there<00:01:56.080> for<00:01:56.290> months<00:02:03.240> fine<00:02:04.240> honest<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.690> think<00:02:04.750> s

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
there for months fine honest I think s

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.770 
there for months fine honest I think s
it's<00:02:05.229> kinda<00:02:05.560> cool<00:02:05.940> probably<00:02:06.940> dangerous<00:02:07.210> as

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
it's kinda cool probably dangerous as

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.300 
it's kinda cool probably dangerous as
hell<00:02:07.960> but<00:02:08.229> still<00:02:13.110> okay<00:02:14.110> there's<00:02:14.410> just<00:02:14.709> an<00:02:14.890> idea

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
hell but still okay there's just an idea

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.350 
hell but still okay there's just an idea
of<00:02:15.520> what<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.880> get<00:02:16.290> okay<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:18.459> did<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> week

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
of what you get okay we did this a week

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.920 
of what you get okay we did this a week
ago<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.050> honestly<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.940> oil<00:02:22.090> was<00:02:22.390> up<00:02:22.420> here

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
ago and honestly the oil was up here

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.110 
ago and honestly the oil was up here
like<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:23.680> thought<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.010> was<00:02:24.070> gonna<00:02:24.310> boil<00:02:24.610> over

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
like we thought it was gonna boil over

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.330 
like we thought it was gonna boil over
by<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.660> time<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.200> were<00:02:26.380> done<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.830> oil<00:02:27.010> had

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
by the time we were done the oil had

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.479 
by the time we were done the oil had
probably<00:02:27.760> dropped<00:02:28.209> about<00:02:28.510> an<00:02:28.810> inch<00:02:29.020> or<00:02:29.230> so

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.990 

quite<00:02:36.489> honestly<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:39.520> helps

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
quite honestly it's just it just helps

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.740 
quite honestly it's just it just helps
me<00:02:40.120> get<00:02:40.270> rid<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> water<00:02:40.930> quicker<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:46.510> soon

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
me get rid of the water quicker as soon

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.199 
me get rid of the water quicker as soon
as<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.019> water<00:02:47.230> gets<00:02:47.590> up<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.730> top<00:02:49.000> of

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
as that water gets up to the the top of

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.030 
as that water gets up to the the top of
the<00:02:49.330> oil<00:02:49.450> like<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.019> said<00:02:50.260> it'll<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.799> burn

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the oil like I said it'll just burn

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.789 
the oil like I said it'll just burn
right<00:02:51.459> off<00:02:54.180> okay

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
uh-oh case you never saw it before or

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.330 
uh-oh case you never saw it before or
didn't<00:02:59.200> really<00:02:59.440> have<00:02:59.620> an<00:02:59.769> idea

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
didn't really have an idea

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.360 
didn't really have an idea
I<00:03:00.810> really<00:03:01.810> don't<00:03:01.989> throw<00:03:02.380> much<00:03:02.650> oil<00:03:02.920> away<00:03:03.190> I

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
I really don't throw much oil away I

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.360 
I really don't throw much oil away I
don't<00:03:03.489> but<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.940> don't<00:03:04.150> do<00:03:04.330> biodiesel<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> me

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
don't but I don't do biodiesel so to me

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.199 
don't but I don't do biodiesel so to me
any<00:03:06.670> oils<00:03:07.150> good<00:03:07.390> oil<00:03:07.630> okay<00:03:08.260> if<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:08.590> wet

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
any oils good oil okay if it's wet

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.259 
any oils good oil okay if it's wet
through<00:03:10.209> evaporation<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:12.250> center<00:03:12.670> fusion<00:03:13.150> of

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
through evaporation the center fusion of

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.560 
through evaporation the center fusion of
it<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.690> can<00:03:14.320> we<00:03:14.590> can<00:03:14.620> dry<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.340> clean<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.640> okay

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
it I can we can dry it and clean it okay

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.080 
it I can we can dry it and clean it okay
it's<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.350> rocket<00:03:17.650> science<00:03:17.860> most<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:18.880> is

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
it's not rocket science most of this is

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.979 
it's not rocket science most of this is
basic<00:03:19.660> stuff<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.980> know<00:03:21.130> what<00:03:21.989> that's

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
basic stuff and you know what that's

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.740 
basic stuff and you know what that's
probably<00:03:23.560> 50<00:03:23.799> gallons<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.640> fuel<00:03:24.820> for<00:03:25.180> us<00:03:26.519> so

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
probably 50 gallons of fuel for us so

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.210 
probably 50 gallons of fuel for us so
