I usually just start with one or two and
you<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.660> jam<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> chimney<00:00:52.710> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
you just jam it up in the chimney you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
you just jam it up in the chimney you
can<00:00:53.610> actually<00:00:53.789> feel<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.629> inside<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
can actually feel up in inside the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.069 
can actually feel up in inside the
chimney<00:00:55.739> where<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> hole<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:58.550> Jam<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> brush

chimney where the hole is Jam the brush
up<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.609> keep<00:01:02.789> feeding

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
up in there and then just keep feeding

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
up in there and then just keep feeding
it<00:01:03.329> through<00:01:03.680> you'll<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.890> once<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.309> reach

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it through you'll know once you reach

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
it through you'll know once you reach
the<00:01:05.670> top<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> squirrel<00:01:07.170> guard<00:01:07.439> or

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the top if you have a squirrel guard or

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.090 
the top if you have a squirrel guard or
something<00:01:07.950> you'll<00:01:08.240> you'll<00:01:09.240> hit<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.930> very<00:01:10.799> top

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
something you'll you'll hit the very top

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.820 
something you'll you'll hit the very top
of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> chimney<00:01:12.290> otherwise<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> don't

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of the chimney otherwise if you don't

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.050 
of the chimney otherwise if you don't
have<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> squirrel<00:01:14.400> guard<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.820> actually

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
have a squirrel guard you can actually

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
have a squirrel guard you can actually
see<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.600> poking<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.430> chimney<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
see it poking out of the chimney but the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.310 
see it poking out of the chimney but the
goal<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.680> try<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.460> material<00:01:21.320> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
goal is to try to get this material that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.109 
goal is to try to get this material that
you<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.270> off<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> lining<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.740> junii

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
you see here off the lining of the junii

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
you see here off the lining of the junii
to<00:01:27.119> reduce<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> chance<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.430> any<00:01:29.430> type<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> fire

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to reduce the chance of any type of fire

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
to reduce the chance of any type of fire
in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> chimney<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.860> I've<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.850> found<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:34.049> me

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in the chimney so I've I found for me

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.609 
in the chimney so I've I found for me
what<00:01:35.130> works<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.990> once<00:01:37.439> I've

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
what works well is to once I've

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.899 
what works well is to once I've
completed<00:01:39.920> gut<00:01:40.920> getting<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> way<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
completed gut getting all the way to the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
completed gut getting all the way to the
top<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> wiggle<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> little

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
top I just kind of wiggle it a little

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.030 
top I just kind of wiggle it a little
bit<00:01:44.299> up<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.439> pulling<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> out

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bit up and down as I'm pulling it out

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.170 
bit up and down as I'm pulling it out
and<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> black<00:01:49.380> debris

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
and you can see some of the black debris

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.499 
and you can see some of the black debris
actually<00:01:51.180> falling<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:53.180> out<00:01:54.180> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
actually falling out as I do that out of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.770 
actually falling out as I do that out of
the<00:01:54.630> chimney

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.660 

so<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:59.740> kind<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.039> up<00:02:00.159> and<00:02:00.369> down<00:02:00.609> a<00:02:02.670> little

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
so just kind of up and down a little

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.380 
so just kind of up and down a little
section<00:02:04.210> at<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.390> time<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.910> just<00:02:10.119> again

cleaning the lining of the chimney and

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.830 
cleaning the lining of the chimney and
it<00:02:12.940> also<00:02:13.120> helps<00:02:13.599> if<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.140> start<00:02:14.470> disconnecting

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it also helps if you start disconnecting

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
here but just trying to twist off one

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:35.940 
here but just trying to twist off one
section<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.040> gets<00:02:33.190> longer<00:02:34.950> there

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
section because as it gets longer there

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.110 
section because as it gets longer there
is<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.370> course<00:02:37.019> more<00:02:38.019> difficulty<00:02:38.799> in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.380 

maneuvering<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.769> there<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.120> end

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
maneuvering it there because this end

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.509 
maneuvering it there because this end
over<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:46.660> was<00:02:46.959> jamming<00:02:47.349> into<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> ground<00:02:47.920> so

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
over here was jamming into the ground so

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.809 
over here was jamming into the ground so
now<00:02:49.390> I've<00:02:49.540> started<00:02:49.840> fresh<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.819> short

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
now I've started fresh with a short

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.449 
now I've started fresh with a short
piece<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.690> sticking<00:02:52.989> up<00:02:53.380> into<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> chimney

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
piece just sticking up into the chimney

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.780 
piece just sticking up into the chimney
and<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.180> go<00:02:55.269> up<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.569> down<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:59.640> whatever<00:03:00.640> is

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
and I can go up and down so whatever is

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.930 
and I can go up and down so whatever is
stuck<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.780> chimney<00:03:02.670> sometimes<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.819> might

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
stuck to the chimney sometimes you might

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.090 
stuck to the chimney sometimes you might
even<00:03:04.090> get<00:03:04.299> a<00:03:04.359> bird's<00:03:04.569> master<00:03:05.170> there's<00:03:05.920> some

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
even get a bird's master there's some

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.750 
even get a bird's master there's some
other<00:03:06.220> type<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.489> animal<00:03:07.470> squirrel<00:03:08.549> nest<00:03:09.549> or

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
other type of animal squirrel nest or

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.460 
other type of animal squirrel nest or
something<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:11.769> see<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> lot<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:13.109> grass<00:03:14.109> or

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
something you see a lot of grass or

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.530 
something you see a lot of grass or
whatever<00:03:14.560> but<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.060> not<00:03:16.239> good

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
whatever but this is this is not good

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.420 
whatever but this is this is not good
for<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.900> your<00:03:17.319> chimney<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:17.950> good<00:03:18.069> idea<00:03:18.190> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
for you your chimney it's a good idea to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.569 
for you your chimney it's a good idea to
clean<00:03:18.639> it<00:03:18.790> at<00:03:18.910> least<00:03:19.090> once<00:03:19.359> a<00:03:19.510> year<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.680> don't

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
clean it at least once a year I don't

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:22.830 
clean it at least once a year I don't
know<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.790> anybody<00:03:21.970> around<00:03:22.239> here<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.660> doesn't

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
know of anybody around here that doesn't

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.449 
know of anybody around here that doesn't
more<00:03:23.139> than<00:03:23.290> once<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.590> year<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:25.470> anyway<00:03:26.470> I'm

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
more than once a year but anyway I'm

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.879 
more than once a year but anyway I'm
gonna<00:03:27.609> keep<00:03:27.790> pulling<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.269> down<00:03:28.420> through<00:03:28.889> until

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
gonna keep pulling it down through until

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.740 
gonna keep pulling it down through until
I<00:03:29.950> get<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> brush<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.389> can<00:03:34.569> get<00:03:34.690> a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
I get to the brush and it can get a

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.560 
I get to the brush and it can get a
little<00:03:35.019> sticky<00:03:35.940> sometimes

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
that from the top from the roof you just

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.190 
that from the top from the roof you just
work<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.800> down<00:04:50.040> instead<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.610> up<00:04:50.820> obviously<00:04:51.200> but

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
work it down instead of up obviously but

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.640 
work it down instead of up obviously but
I<00:04:53.030> found<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.210> safer<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.720> course<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.140> do<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.380> from

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
I found it safer of course to do it from
