00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.189
 also who is waiting and who is so and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.440
 German is my dear and and value 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 face before presenting because that's it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 the past not so for you are a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.719
 super median for missing but these stuff 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060
 there is nothing stuff and I do not want 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.510
 to hear that really is it would be 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.310
 would not be well 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.340
 let's not talk about it the story is close 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 and love sheridan morais so there so 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 dead state maybe we speak a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.699
 little bit of you because you are 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.900
 known hp I'm whatever this style without 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.099
 True I could not do a small print 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.170
 with him I see myself the end of 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 the show I make a prior absolutely 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.540
 so then talked a little bit about you and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.040
 soul 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570
 so I'm a medium so let's see 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 I work mainly with my 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.780
 flash and I'm also working on using 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850
 the oracle of belline and their rules 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.930
 of the triad 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 this is my game and I brought back the price 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.879
 it's not true that you are the only one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 see to me I'm fascinated by this game 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.550
 unhealthy did not give to people 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.170
 visually impaired hb of course will see well 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.789
 but since commenting on what you are 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.010
 exercise then this is the seventh year by 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.210
 which gqg clear that besancon here is in 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.119
 slices count all cases you have to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 reputation I like more than good 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.900
 he always firstly for that thank you 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.729
 it's not the case for everyone but 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.049
 but now I can not wait but also to have 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.040
 the same a small draw all went but 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.330
 we are going to benefit all 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.350
 people a lot of people you 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.689
 to store a self receive on this 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.700

 more crazy yes you'll know 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:20.850
 I had a possibility of evolution in 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.110
 the other hockey in the work the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.280
 work of these people you touch 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.510

 12 years old and the oracle of belline but 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.000

 pretty and pretty so yes there is 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.800
 well a damian evolution that is done 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.239
 so me this evolution is from 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.890
 progressive way as if it was 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.269
 manage a little bit of training 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.500
 continues at the company level as 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.330
 if your leader goes a little bit 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.650
 take under the arm and support you 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.140
 to be able to climb to be able to take 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.040
 responsabilities 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.350
 a little thing on the other hand I know you 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:08.970
 work in jewelry or with gold 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:11.459

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.150
 ok so here we are on something that 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.760
 talk about year 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.079
 Well, I see where they are from 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.810
 gold coins silver 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:25.560
 currency joidon it's so much it's the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:29.820
 flashes save things from readings 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 yesterday rather to the and I explain not here 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.470
 braddock bingo here and so there at 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.970
 level of evolution for me that's 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.760
 therefore plays on this year and on the year 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.810
 next and I will even tell you I have 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.310
 not even the impression that you have 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.420
 great thing to ask damien see this 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.430
 that I mean if we recognize your 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.519
 qualities 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.690
 how is it nickel ah yes yes yes 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.070
 you surprise me yes 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.300
 So here we go 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.680
 really a little bit under your wing and 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.420
 we will help you we will help you 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.680
 push one will help you get on by 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.060
 against a small thing it is not 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.230
 impossible that you have a problem of 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.720
 fires including the premises of your 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.270
 business by damien way a 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.440
 fire problem world is talking about fire 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.610
 then something that remains 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.440
 minor since it does not stop 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.100
 activity but for me there will be a 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.100
 fire problem 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:23.050
 we would have to avoid the dangers 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:25.930
 it's nothing ben you see like that in 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.280
 anyway that's what to say more so 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.280
 show must go on as I usually do 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.640
 yes yes you risk you risk the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.950
 toxi he notice that we chose the street 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.240
 risk who are you predicting yeah there for me 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.560
 there is no change see even if they 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.790
 resort and even though 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.810
 viewers who watch the 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.830
 know a little of the rac 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.150
 belline and look at the cards 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.500
 it's not because you have the map 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.700
 of the accident that will come out that that 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.560
 mean it's going to be catastrophic or 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.180
 anything to look right there 7/4 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.470
 so that does not mean it's okay 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.550
 to be catastrophic quite the contrary it 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.990
 must be put in touch with the 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.660
 other cards and with the flashes 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.750
 this is aliens kissing you 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.100
 war full of courage sitting 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.650
 just a crowd at the cij is one thing 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.960

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.270
 cabbage that was not planned and that will 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.550

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.380
 okay and it's working very hard 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.950
 likely in the twelve to sixteen months that 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:25.840
 okay here ok you already have 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.220
