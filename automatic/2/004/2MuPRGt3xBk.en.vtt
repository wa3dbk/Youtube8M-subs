Dave as you can see here we have a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.490 
Dave as you can see here we have a
typical<00:01:29.060> furnace<00:01:29.540> installation<00:01:29.840> where<00:01:30.409> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
typical furnace installation where the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.649 
typical furnace installation where the
wires<00:01:30.680> come<00:01:31.010> from<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.250> outside<00:01:31.610> unit<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.540> the

indoor unit and from the indoor unit up
to<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.549> thermostat<00:01:35.110> so<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:36.200> move<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
to the thermostat so we move the
