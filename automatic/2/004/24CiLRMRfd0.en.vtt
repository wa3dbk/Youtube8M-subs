a lot of habits that I got a break I
like<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> young<00:01:35.790> guy<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.540> mold

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
like to have a young guy that I can mold

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
like to have a young guy that I can mold
I<00:01:36.930> look<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.229> each<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> every<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.220> as

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I look at each and every one of them as

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.920 
I look at each and every one of them as
an<00:01:38.430> individual<00:01:38.939> piece<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.299> clay<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> get

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
an individual piece of clay that I get

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.319 
an individual piece of clay that I get
to<00:01:40.079> mold<00:01:40.320> fundamentally<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> pride

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to mold fundamentally I like to pride

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.990 
to mold fundamentally I like to pride
myself<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.869> fundamental<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.590> techniques<00:01:44.000> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
myself on fundamental and techniques and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
myself on fundamental and techniques and
not<00:01:45.270> always<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:46.020> bigger<00:01:46.229> stronger

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
not always there will be bigger stronger

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.950 
not always there will be bigger stronger
faster<00:01:46.770> than<00:01:47.250> everybody<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.820> play<00:01:48.030> against<00:01:48.329> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
faster than everybody we play against so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
faster than everybody we play against so
we<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> give<00:01:49.560> those<00:01:49.740> guys<00:01:49.799> an<00:01:50.189> edge<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
we got to give those guys an edge to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.600 
we got to give those guys an edge to
find<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> way<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.960> successful<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.340> when

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
find a way to be successful when we when

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
find a way to be successful when we when
we<00:01:53.640> find<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> matchup<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:55.200> might<00:01:55.380> be

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
we find that matchup that they might be

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.929 
we find that matchup that they might be
a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.740> bigger<00:01:55.979> stronger<00:01:56.280> faster<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a little bigger stronger faster or a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.459 
a little bigger stronger faster or a
little<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.270> old<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.689> whatever<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.079> case<00:01:58.259> may

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
little bit old or whatever the case may

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.310 
little bit old or whatever the case may
be<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.000> it's<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.090> great<00:02:00.299> opportunity<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.930> me<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
be so it's a great opportunity for me to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.679 
be so it's a great opportunity for me to
come<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> develop<00:02:02.100> young<00:02:02.549> guys<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.180> like

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the fact that I don't have to break bad

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.459
