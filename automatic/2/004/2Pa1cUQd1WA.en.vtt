quickly review the different types of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.900 
quickly review the different types of
terrain<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> game<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.520> first<00:00:20.699> type<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
terrain in the game the first type is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.609 
terrain in the game the first type is
open<00:00:21.449> terrain<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.170> course<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.470> can

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
open terrain which of course you can

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.830 
open terrain which of course you can
move<00:00:22.830> through<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.250> shoot<00:00:23.490> through<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.689> also

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
move through and shoot through we also

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
move through and shoot through we also
have<00:00:25.050> difficult<00:00:25.500> terrain<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
have difficult terrain some of this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.240 
have difficult terrain some of this
rubble<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.019> tomb<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.710> difficult

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
rubble in in this tomb is difficult

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.650 
rubble in in this tomb is difficult
which<00:00:29.429> means<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> end<00:00:30.420> your

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
which means that you have to end your

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.150 
which means that you have to end your
move<00:00:30.929> when<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> enter<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.920> still

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
move when you enter it you can still

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459 
move when you enter it you can still
shoot<00:00:32.399> through<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.000> third<00:00:33.930> type<00:00:34.200> that's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
shoot through it and third type that's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.220 
shoot through it and third type that's
in<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.010> blocked<00:00:35.579> rain<00:00:35.910> walls<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.840> pillars

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
in here is blocked rain walls or pillars

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.770 
in here is blocked rain walls or pillars
which<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> can't<00:00:38.129> enter<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:39.090> shoot<00:00:39.420> through

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
which you can't enter or shoot through

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
which you can't enter or shoot through
clock<00:00:40.440> terrain<00:00:40.879> does<00:00:41.879> make<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> big<00:00:42.300> difference

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
clock terrain does make a big difference

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.410 
clock terrain does make a big difference
to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.290> way<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.800> play<00:00:44.550> out<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> map<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to the way that you play out a map so

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.330 
to the way that you play out a map so
let's<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.320> example<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.860> ranged

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
let's take for example this ranged

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.940 
let's take for example this ranged
attack<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.000> spark<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:49.410> has<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> range<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
attack the spark which has a range of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
attack the spark which has a range of
six<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> red<00:00:51.210> squares<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
six you can see the red squares that I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
six you can see the red squares that I
can<00:00:52.050> hit<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.710> spark<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:54.239> can't

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
can hit with this spark and I can't

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.180 
can hit with this spark and I can't
actually<00:00:54.719> hit<00:00:55.020> any<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.410> these<00:00:55.530> skeletons<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
actually hit any of these skeletons or

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
actually hit any of these skeletons or
zombies<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:57.239> those<00:00:57.629> two<00:00:57.870> big<00:00:58.050> pillars

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
zombies because those two big pillars

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
zombies because those two big pillars
are<00:00:58.620> blocking<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.100> line<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> sight<00:01:00.320> that's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
are blocking my line of sight that's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
are blocking my line of sight that's
where<00:01:01.559> area<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.100> effect<00:01:02.219> cards<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.090> come<00:01:03.300> in

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
where area of effect cards can come in

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 
where area of effect cards can come in
handy<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.409> example<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.920> lightning<00:01:05.430> bolt

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
handy so for example this lightning bolt

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.300 
handy so for example this lightning bolt
is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> linear<00:01:06.360> card<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.470> means<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is a linear card and that means it it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.690 
is a linear card and that means it it
hits<00:01:09.180> every<00:01:09.720> creature<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:11.010> every<00:01:11.340> square

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hits every creature or every square

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
hits every creature or every square
that's<00:01:12.060> between<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.049> target<00:01:13.470> square

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that's between you and the target square

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.310 
that's between you and the target square
so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> game<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> showing

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so you can see that the game is showing

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.749 
so you can see that the game is showing
me<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.530> yellow<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> squares<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.670> are

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
me in yellow all the squares that are

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.390 
me in yellow all the squares that are
going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.090> affected<00:01:18.630> by<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.680> card<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
going to be affected by this card as I

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.179 
going to be affected by this card as I
mouse<00:01:20.700> around<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.890> catch

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
mouse around and I can actually catch

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.450 
mouse around and I can actually catch
some<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.330> zombies<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.619> lightning

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
some of these zombies with my lightning

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.179 
some of these zombies with my lightning
bolt<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> affect<00:01:28.950> things

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
bolt because it's going to affect things

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.149 
bolt because it's going to affect things
that<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> can't<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> don't

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
that I can't actually see what I don't

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
that I can't actually see what I don't
have<00:01:32.340> line<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> sight<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.229> example<00:01:34.320> if

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
have line of sight to so for example if

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.390 
have line of sight to so for example if
I<00:01:34.799> cast<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.310> clueless<00:01:37.189> unfortunately<00:01:38.189> he<00:01:38.310> had

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
I cast a clueless unfortunately he had

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.370 
I cast a clueless unfortunately he had
an<00:01:38.490> armor<00:01:38.820> card<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.360> blocked<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.900> attack

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
an armor card that blocked that attack

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.970 
an armor card that blocked that attack
anyway<00:01:42.380> moving<00:01:42.980> on<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:45.020> also<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.500> burst

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
anyway moving on we also have burst

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.780 
anyway moving on we also have burst
spells<00:01:46.580> in<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.910> game<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.240> burst<00:01:47.480> spells<00:01:48.790> ones

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.530 
spells in the game and burst spells ones
that<00:01:50.120> affect<00:01:50.300> an<00:01:50.720> area<00:01:51.440> above<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.580> spell<00:01:53.330> is

so<00:01:59.000> once<00:01:59.180> again<00:01:59.330> as<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.290> mouse<00:02:00.530> around<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.340> game

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
so once again as I mouse around the game

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.859 
so once again as I mouse around the game
is<00:02:01.700> going<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.910> show<00:02:02.119> me<00:02:02.270> in<00:02:02.360> yellow<00:02:02.660> which

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
is going to show me in yellow which

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.390 
is going to show me in yellow which
squares<00:02:03.200> are<00:02:03.410> going<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.710> affected<00:02:04.160> by<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
squares are going to be affected by the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.670 
squares are going to be affected by the
fireball<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.660> can<00:02:05.810> see<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.050> can<00:02:06.170> actually

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
fireball so you can see I can actually

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.710 
fireball so you can see I can actually
hit<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.040> pretty<00:02:07.369> large<00:02:07.580> group<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.119> monsters<00:02:08.570> if

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
hit a pretty large group of monsters if

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.110 
hit a pretty large group of monsters if
I<00:02:08.810> cast<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.410> fireball<00:02:10.190> there<00:02:10.399> should<00:02:11.090> just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
I cast the fireball there should just

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.930 
I cast the fireball there should just
note<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.510> even<00:02:12.410> buzzed<00:02:12.830> spells<00:02:13.250> are

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
note that even buzzed spells are

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.080 
note that even buzzed spells are
affected<00:02:14.480> by<00:02:14.510> terrain<00:02:15.580> though<00:02:16.580> these<00:02:16.760> pillars

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
affected by terrain though these pillars

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.570 
affected by terrain though these pillars
you<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.720> are<00:02:17.900> blocking<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.650> fireball

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
you can see are blocking the fireball

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.000 
you can see are blocking the fireball
from<00:02:19.730> affecting<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.620> full<00:02:21.910> 25<00:02:22.910> squares<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:24.170> it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
from affecting a full 25 squares that it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.860 
from affecting a full 25 squares that it
might<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.430> i<00:02:25.550> cashed<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> open<00:02:26.540> but

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
might if i cashed it in the open but

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.750 
might if i cashed it in the open but
anyways<00:02:27.140> if<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.680> cast<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.070> here<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.520> still

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
anyways if I cast it here I can still

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.820 
anyways if I cast it here I can still
catch<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.120> pretty<00:02:29.360> sizable<00:02:29.870> number<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:33.320> fathers

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
catch a pretty sizable number so fathers

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.820 
catch a pretty sizable number so fathers
are<00:02:34.040> very<00:02:34.940> useful<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.660> large<00:02:36.410> groups<00:02:36.500> of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
are very useful for large groups of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.640 
are very useful for large groups of
monsters<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.580> also<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:38.780> using<00:02:39.230> these<00:02:39.350> kind

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
monsters and also for using these kind

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.810 
monsters and also for using these kind
of<00:02:40.510> constrained<00:02:41.510> areas<00:02:42.350> like<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.280> this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
of constrained areas like this this

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.690 
of constrained areas like this this
particular<00:02:44.000> board<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.410> final<00:02:45.739> area<00:02:46.459> of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
particular board and the final area of

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.310 
particular board and the final area of
effect<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:47.060> wanted<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.330> show<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.510> today<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.080> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
effect I wanted to show you today is the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.130 
effect I wanted to show you today is the
cone<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:49.700> Thunder<00:02:50.090> blast<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> cone

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
cone so this Thunder blast is a cone

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.870 
cone so this Thunder blast is a cone
attack<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.220> means<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.489> going<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> hit

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
attack and that means it's going to hit

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.449 
attack and that means it's going to hit
all<00:02:53.180> squares<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.260> 90<00:02:54.560> degree<00:02:54.680> arc<00:02:55.070> within

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
all squares in a 90 degree arc within

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.490 
all squares in a 90 degree arc within
its<00:02:55.610> range<00:02:55.850> which<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.209> six<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.380> other

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
its range which is six and the other

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.289 
its range which is six and the other
interesting<00:02:57.920> thing<00:02:57.980> about<00:02:58.190> Thunder<00:02:58.790> blast<00:02:59.000> is

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
interesting thing about Thunder blast is

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.380 
interesting thing about Thunder blast is
that<00:02:59.720> it's<00:03:00.380> not<00:03:00.769> stopped<00:03:01.280> by<00:03:01.400> bach<00:03:01.640> terrain<00:03:02.000> so

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
that it's not stopped by bach terrain so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.440 
that it's not stopped by bach terrain so
you<00:03:02.450> can<00:03:02.660> see<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.580> normally<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.700> wouldn't<00:03:04.850> be

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
you can see that normally it wouldn't be

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.850 
you can see that normally it wouldn't be
a<00:03:05.480> lot<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.750> use<00:03:05.900> here<00:03:05.930> because<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.620> pillow

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
a lot of use here because of that pillow

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.360 
a lot of use here because of that pillow
right<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.220> front<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.549> my<00:03:08.269> dwarf<00:03:08.630> priest<00:03:09.370> but

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
right in front of my dwarf priest but

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.770 
right in front of my dwarf priest but
because<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.820> can<00:03:10.940> go<00:03:11.120> through<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.600> blog

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
because it can go through the blog

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.550 
because it can go through the blog
terrain<00:03:12.140> I'm<00:03:12.470> actually<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.010> hit

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
terrain I'm actually going to hit

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.740 
terrain I'm actually going to hit
a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.800> monsters<00:03:14.280> with<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:17.750> once

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
a lot of monsters with this one once

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.430 
a lot of monsters with this one once
again<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:20.130> zombies<00:03:20.550> resistant<00:03:21.120> hide

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
again the zombies resistant hide

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.690 
again the zombies resistant hide
stopping<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.530> clean<00:03:22.709> quite<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.069> much<00:03:23.220> damage<00:03:23.459> as

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
stopping a clean quite as much damage as

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.210 
stopping a clean quite as much damage as
outline<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.170> does<00:03:25.319> stun<00:03:25.680> all<00:03:26.069> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
outline but it does stun all the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.360 
outline but it does stun all the
monsters<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.030> that's<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.569> pretty<00:03:27.780> good<00:03:27.900> effect

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
monsters and that's a pretty good effect

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.339 
monsters and that's a pretty good effect
so<00:03:29.370> anyway<00:03:29.910> thanks<00:03:30.269> for<00:03:30.360> watching<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.959> diary
