00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 if some people were astonished 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.440
 by fitting to the future of the Templars 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 it's for the simple reason that it 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.290
 Ideological time spoon 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.970
 yet since the first game 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.710
 assassin's creed treats well in conflict 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.660
 political and ideological between two 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.889
 very powerful hours and quesnoy women 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.450
 having had a lot of success in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.740
 assassin's creed 3 the community 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 begins to realize the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 promiscuity meanwhile killers and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.080
 I really care about it 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.340
 but obviously I'm not the only one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 to side with this order at 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.849
 ubisoft makes us understand 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 announcing assassin's creed brown coming soon 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.359
 on xbox 360 and playstation 3 for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.520
 November 2014 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.780
 that is to say at the same time as unity this 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.100
 assassin's creed happens during the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.170
 seven-year war in north america 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 which is not trivial since this 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.379
 conflict involves the French and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.700
 will prove to be one of the causes of the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.559
 economic situation of France 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 leading the revolution lent in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.340
 unity the game is linked with assassin's 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.840
 creed black flag since this is the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.489
 following from a chronological point of view and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 of gameplay but it will mostly serve 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.460
 introduce the context of assassin's 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 creed iii by taking back these places such 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 that border or new york and we 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.500
 hope his characters such as 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 achille and women or benjamin franklin 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 the hero shy patrick cormack and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.750
 Irish and if like me you like 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 the original versions you can 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.600
 recognize an Irish accent in his 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.130
 voice it's part of the order of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.659
 assassins but follows an event that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.610
 would like better kept hidden 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.320
 will find disown order to live from 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.820
 ambiguously since he will decide 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 to embrace the philosophy of the Templars 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 while keeping his creed to him at the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.310
 door way quesnoy its purpose 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 principal according to the kinematic trailer 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 would be in eliminating the killers who 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.590
 have caused him harm in terms of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.729
 playability we stay in enough beds 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.619
 classic since he followed 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 killer training it will do 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.670
 so of the course like the others with 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.409
 some exclusive movements however 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 this screenwriting inversion will entail 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.680
 gameplay changes 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.600
 indeed you are the same as in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 the multiplayer hunters and chase the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.780
 missions will be good at murder 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 targets but assassins will be able to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 their turn to kill you remains to know if 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.549
 their action will be punished kivu have for 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.780
 the moment what we know is 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 that they will be able to hide themselves in 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 usual hiding places heap of hay 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.220
 grass tall crowd 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.960
 but like the multiplayer they 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
 will be spotted thanks to the whispers 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.710
 in addition to that makes it makes sense 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000
 of the advanced eagle that will allow him to 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.439
 protect yourself more easily 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.090
 similarly the ancillary activities is seen 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.350
 reversed for example the contracts 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.909
 assassinate who had a resignation 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.440
 scop you will need intercity 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850
 assassins 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.080
 and the city neighborhoods that will be needed 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.830
 a departure enough to assassin 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.210
 take control 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.800
 there will also be news 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.080
 specific to drugs concerning 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.550
 weapons and shea marine gameplay 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.170
 will own a rifle as a gun 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.610
 principal which to attract several 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.990
 types of projectiles thus gathering 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.330
 the different chiefs of Edward 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.590
 outremont unveiled with the presence of 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.270
 firecrackers and other grenades 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.010
 we also note the presence of bari 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.840
 poison that will help you but 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.490
 also you handicap my little ones 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.810
 subtleties this time a mascara 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.040
 watchdoc will be there to protect you 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.320
 story to be more consistent than 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.000
 previously we will remember the duos 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.100
 insensitive to smoke while 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.300
 enemies could see the sup hockey side sea 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.190
 we will have a new right our 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.090
 morrigan boat like the jack 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.650
 where it will be entirely 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.690
 customizable and have weapons 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.010
 even more enjoyable than the latter with 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.720
 crude input oil replaced barry 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.300
 explosive or the grape that replaces 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.740
 the pivot gun a little rigid enemies 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.240
 can also approach your ship 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.010
 and pack ice in the form of blocks of 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.030
 ice will be part of the game taking 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.650
 frame in north america 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.730
 assassin's creed drug and so the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.740
 conclusion of assassin's creed on 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.570
 playstation 3 and 360 generation 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.460
 it appears as a script link and 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.080
 contextual in Thrace narrow and enough 4 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.700
 and could be the quiet season the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.040
 more varied resulted from the license on two 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.510
 generations the wiiu pc communities are 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.800
 always waiting for a portage that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.940
 can not be ruled out when we know the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.709
 assassin's course creed iii 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.450
 release for example small edition 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 collector is also expected note 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.390
 also that until now the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.860
 multiplayer is noted as absent this 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.180
 which is quite amazing considering we know 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.860
 that he is also absent in 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.450
 assassin's creed unity if you wish 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.250
 finally discover assassin's creed 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.630
 from the Templar continue to us 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.700
 follow I will be happy to 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.360
 share and analyze info about 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.450
 upcoming games 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.709
 and do not forget can the father of the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.709
 wisdom guide you
