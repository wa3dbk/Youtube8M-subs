00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Talk to me, people. Okay, I'm fine today. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.790
 here to tell you that today 15 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 three years ago that harry potter and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.490
 The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 released 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.890
 Good, I've always been a fan of harry 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 potter in every movie is 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 some collector stuff and I'm going 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 talk a little bit about how it was mine 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.310
 experience to see a movie in the cinema 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
 on preview 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.460
 I went with a friend of mine and the other day. 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.239
 I had class and bad the funniest thing I 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.940
 I was crying already I was already in 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.180
 certain parts is just like in books, right? 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.520
 I was already assigned to cry 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 the part that I cried the most was death 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 the swan pi nÃ© 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.420
 I think the majority of 80 or 90 per 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.489
 of the population who saw the film is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.520
 must have sniffed at that part 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.229
 and in the end that kind face just for 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.920
 harry potter fans in the head you bounce 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.010
 on a DVD and re view or read the books 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 again like I do 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:19.830
 and now to jay kay write a new tale 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.890
 I have not read it yet, I have not seen anything but I 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.990
 I'm looking forward to reading now how I feel about it. 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.259
 vacation and wonder what it is that 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.420
 they stayed like this I think I had 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.460
 11 years my letter from robert to today 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.829
 I had a duty to you 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 I won on enem not my brother who 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.500
 I won my godfather in the day 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 children 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.149
 and I was afraid of love volga when I was 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.740
 child when he appeared in the first 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.570
 movie was hiding me is some revelations 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.350
 here's harry potter in my life right? 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.069
 people then harry potter three years ago 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.060
 I was only going to say that today because I 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290
 I almost forgot people 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.659

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.099
 I forgot why I was without internet today 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.390
 and when I saw I remembered, either I 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.489
 I do not speak, you do not have to make a video as well. 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.700
