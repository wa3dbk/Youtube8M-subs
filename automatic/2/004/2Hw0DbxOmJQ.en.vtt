resilience all the types of lifelong
management<00:02:21.849> skills<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.540> want<00:02:22.780> every

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
management skills that we want every

individual to have find their seeds in

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:50.970 
individual to have find their seeds in
these<00:02:26.200> very<00:02:26.440> young<00:02:26.680> years<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:49.780> also<00:02:49.959> pay<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> lot

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
these very young years we also pay a lot

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.449 
these very young years we also pay a lot
of<00:02:51.010> attention<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:53.319> how<00:02:53.530> teachers<00:02:53.890> manage

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
of attention to to how teachers manage

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.390 
of attention to to how teachers manage
time<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.819> manage<00:02:55.780> behavior<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.829> activities

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
time and manage behavior and activities

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.539 
time and manage behavior and activities
so<00:02:58.150> we<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.410> see<00:02:59.620> teachers<00:03:00.010> structure

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
so we like to see teachers structure

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.460 
so we like to see teachers structure
learning<00:03:00.850> environments<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.989> ways<00:03:02.230> or

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
learning environments in ways or

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.960 
learning environments in ways or
learning<00:03:02.799> activities<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.459> way<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.760> allows

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
learning activities in a way that allows

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.879 
learning activities in a way that allows
kids<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.480> move<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.049> allows<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.560> make

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
kids to move and allows you to make

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.430 
kids to move and allows you to make
noise<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.609> allows<00:03:06.880> them<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.690> really<00:03:08.139> kind<00:03:08.380> of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
noise and allows them to really kind of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.660 
noise and allows them to really kind of
express<00:03:08.920> themselves<00:03:09.489> individually<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:14.670> think

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
express themselves individually I think

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.610 
express themselves individually I think
one<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.000> more<00:03:16.359> important<00:03:16.930> elements<00:03:17.470> that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
one of the more important elements that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.470 
one of the more important elements that
we<00:03:17.769> see<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.069> interaction<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:19.030> ways<00:03:19.239> in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
we see of interaction are the ways in

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.039 
we see of interaction are the ways in
which<00:03:19.510> adults<00:03:20.500> provide<00:03:21.459> ways<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.299> stretch

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
which adults provide ways that stretch

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.370 
which adults provide ways that stretch
