00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
this game so I guess it's just me pts

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.810 
this game so I guess it's just me pts
now<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.370> don't<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
now so just that and I don't have a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.880 
now so just that and I don't have a
camera<00:02:29.620> um<00:02:30.819> taking<00:02:31.819> my<00:02:32.569> game<00:02:33.110> play<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:33.739> it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
camera um taking my game play with it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.790 
camera um taking my game play with it
footage<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.610> time<00:02:35.050> as<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.200> can't<00:02:36.410> really<00:02:36.560> fit

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
footage this time as I can't really fit

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.590 
footage this time as I can't really fit
on<00:02:36.920> screen<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:39.290> guess<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:40.069> could<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.600> have

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
on screen so I guess you could just have

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.530 
on screen so I guess you could just have
the<00:02:42.080> soothing<00:02:42.530> comfort<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:43.160> my<00:02:43.310> voice<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.760> guess

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.920
