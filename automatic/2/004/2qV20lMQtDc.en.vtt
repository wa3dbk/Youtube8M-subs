00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.520
 Yes 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.880
 I have so and what do we have such a 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.990
 game saying it was now not the best 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.990
 a damage this desired again 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.010
 that or certainly not her 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.170
 have the game actually under control 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.880
 and by standards have it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 Unfortunately, the game did not succeed 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.090
 At home we bring three 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.140
 score so isses stop we stand again 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.150
 there last week is a stupid thing 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.160
 get a go 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.360
 we make a big part of the game 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.360
 why do i just put that up 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.010
 two or even the 3 0 after i got 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110
 can always explain that word then 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.030
 would make it more likely we have 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.369
 but the chances unfortunately had again 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.750
 not done and it just has to be there 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.160
 create the ball to perhaps 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.430
 you can see that the calm 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.310
 Rostocker bit pressure and then 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.690
 get the 1 1 and even then 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.040
 continue to watch the flow of each player 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.100
 click and something at home again 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.330
 tear and we did not manage that 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.300
 and where you look forward to it long 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.100
 stadions is then relatively full again then 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.920
 even more annoying the internet like that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.660
 of course, conclusion loses no matter 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.490
 how to fall in love is of course still 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.380
 bitter but it is for our measurement 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.910
 put together and also pull together 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.410
 perhaps that is only the second to 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.600
 against mainz made next weeks because 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.060
 it goes on so fast 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.170
 again hands race around actual 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.690
 again to you how are you now 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.920
 not your bets do not get 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.229
 glad it finally stands on big 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.399
 My reha and me continue my journey 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.229
 Of course I hope so now 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.060
 bit the game newspaper but come 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.160
 which also make more successful than 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.660
 Everything works well for the guys magical 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.190
 or continues 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.450
 toni could now derby from outside 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.270
 watch the last one was still 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 bit different states as the circuit 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.820
 it is even too us supplier 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.700
 lose because of them sit and watch out for 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.170
 would have to look around later 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.540
 of course I sleep worse, I say 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.220
 times as some plays first shame 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.630
 Of course, as is the second course 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.070
 halftime ran his times, a clear 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.930
 bit with luck his von rostock 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.880
 Thinking the first one goes by the post and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.850
 the thing about the line expresses 100 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440
 the second is, of course, as we said time 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.610
 difficult so in the end you have to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.120
 easy to say a bitter 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.950
 defeat 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.510
 you have a little bit of feeling 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.040
 From 17 o'clock had the young 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.750
 was a bit ko you might have 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.800
 also with 12 other new people still 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.630
 bring in a little bit of swing 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.560
 or was there already the better day to 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.040
 hope the team that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.540
 runs through 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.520
 yes, that's good in the measure of it 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.570
 trainers if someone else in front 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.150
 who brings or not, I think we 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.980
 The game dominates over long distances 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.300
 have 70 percent of my view 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.100
 had possession of the ball 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.120
 but as I said have it unfortunately 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.010
 not even a second goal 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.590
 Follow up with everyone else out of the way 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.880
 have to go yes that is clear that 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.170
 clarity why push the main problem 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.670
 if I had the second one, that was the third one 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.510
 Go what was in it and get it 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.880
 such an ugly start to the question 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 it's hard to answer 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.400
 Of course, in the end, it's easy 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.560
 bitter as once how it went 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.050
 but of course we have to watch that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.730
 We try to get to the second goal 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.319
 reward 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.790
 and as I said then the the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.430
 to get out of the way 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.840
 how do you build inflation? 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.670
 Derby defeat again as I said 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.040
 we have to pull ourselves out of there together 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.080
 and support us says the game 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.720
 also try because there is not one off 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.920
 after an evaluation to then after 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.299
 maybe to bring forward times away 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.860
 take the points again 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.870
 now that you you how to go from here 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.090
 forward so for me it looks good 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.500
 So I think I try in three 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.819
 weeks again parallel to the team too 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.129
 train visitors easier pass exercises 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.709
 to do more, then I say 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.150
 to increase it slowly 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.280
 hammer still opportunities this again 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.120
 to see is a small goal of mine 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.090
 Of course maybe two three 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.440
 to have short-cuts but that would be us 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.930
 so it would be nice for of course 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.099
 myself too and there we have to 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.700
 wait and see how it all now 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.379
 continues 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.140
 ok then the team head up the 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.060
 still well soon and then back on 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.569
 now this exit is always us 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.519
 I have already expected to be very tall 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.870
 think in the end yes because we have it 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.979
 simply a gift of the game and 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.260
 by two by two standards too 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.340
 these are the points of today at the end we are 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.930
 Also, I think everyone is very disappointed 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.500
 but that was our fault that we 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.500
 today three points 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.139
 exactly the biggest problem for us 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.729
 currently it I can do it in 2330 according to 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.560
 to refill but the other life is yes 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.560
 even against permanent 90 minutes still 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.400
 the car balancing or still in 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.840
 sight and opponents 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.600
 why does not look simply times the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.770
 to hold points as I said that may us 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.889
 just do not happen, especially not 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.639
 just such an important game 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:02.440
 it just totally annoying because you have one 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:04.150
 safe and then zero points in the end 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.460
 Last one last point 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.139
 taken away but this week holds 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.639
 with us 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.389
 just beautiful something positive to your 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.759
 class goal 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.169
 the first two free-kick situation 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.460
 left by one been shot tor was a 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.699
 right to clean was a little bit 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.090
 I'll work it up again 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.949
 think the second one was wanted 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.529
 in the goalkeeper corner because there so close to 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.490
 so gate was today on the sixteenth and 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.919
 I believe the first one I believe 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:39.659
 been back in the world goalkeeper 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:40.830
 and that's why I noticed exactly 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.210
 a little bit the new school is at it 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.860
 pity that now the opponents here in 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.560
 stadium minutes and always plays 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.789
 still celebrating sees that came only the 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.529
 make next weeks more that one 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.659
 finally the victory again 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:54.180
 take 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.169
 just twice as a team 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.840
 it works again today 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.759
 but also have only certain situations 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.580
 we are going to sleep again today and that has to be there 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.779
 just not going to happen and the power-on 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.999
 Finally, a bit missing from the 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.379
 75 had the feeling that the boys 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:12.779
 just in the middle were a bit 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:14.070
 ko I think it knows in the end 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.810
 Not 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.860
 if we have the 2 0 we just have some 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.810
 counterpart they do not have that good 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.550
 played out and we do the 2 0 then 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.440
 the game is also played by other winners 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.160
 play well but the 2 0 not done 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.410
 and if you then later lost 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.580
 ok now again took time and 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.580
 then it can only get better
