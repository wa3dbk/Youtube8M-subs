grew up outdoors I grew up on a farm and
it<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.769> simply<00:01:04.979> wasn't<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.270> necessary<00:01:07.050> thing

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it just simply wasn't a necessary thing

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.859

as<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> got<00:01:08.520> older<00:01:08.550> I<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:08.970> found<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.659> no

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
as I got older I just found that no

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
really understand that humans have been

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.660 
really understand that humans have been
around<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.000> tens<00:01:51.239> of<00:01:51.780> thousands<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.530> years<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
around for tens of thousands of years so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.570 
around for tens of thousands of years so
what<00:01:53.819> happened<00:01:54.209> why<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.569> it<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.929> in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.340> last

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
what happened why is it that in the last

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.820 
what happened why is it that in the last
like<00:01:57.119> couple<00:01:57.420> thousand<00:01:58.140> years<00:01:58.289> we've<00:01:58.500> decided

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
like couple thousand years we've decided

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.449 
like couple thousand years we've decided
that<00:01:59.130> they're<00:01:59.489> necessary<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.830> see<00:02:01.830> pictures<00:02:02.220> in

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
that they're necessary I see pictures in

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.419 
that they're necessary I see pictures in
the<00:02:03.030> 1800's<00:02:03.929> of<00:02:04.050> England<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.590> people<00:02:05.280> of

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
the 1800's of England of people of
