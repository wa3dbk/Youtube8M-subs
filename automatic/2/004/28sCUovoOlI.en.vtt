00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830 

what<00:00:00.359> W<00:00:00.659> to<00:00:00.870> and<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:02.310> know<00:00:02.340> just<00:00:02.700> watch<00:00:03.210> hajime

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
what W to and you know just watch hajime

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.330 
what W to and you know just watch hajime
no<00:00:03.870> ippo<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:06.049> kuroko<00:00:07.049> no<00:00:07.080> basket<00:00:07.589> but<00:00:07.830> we'll

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
no ippo and kuroko no basket but we'll

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.850 
no ippo and kuroko no basket but we'll
start<00:00:08.610> with<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.849> ipoh<00:00:09.389> first<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.710> think

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
start with the ipoh first so I think

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.770 
start with the ipoh first so I think
finally<00:00:11.670> they<00:00:12.420> might<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.960> slowed<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.679> down

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
finally they might have slowed it down

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.000 
finally they might have slowed it down
because<00:00:15.780> they<00:00:15.990> actually<00:00:16.199> include<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.859> some

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
because they actually include in some

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.099 
because they actually include in some
parts<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.359> three<00:00:18.600> girls<00:00:18.720> came

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
chance because i don't know why they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
chance because i don't know why they
obviously<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:47.010> each<00:00:47.070> other<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.579> should<00:00:47.730> do

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
obviously like each other they should do

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
obviously like each other they should do
something<00:00:48.920> also<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.420> ipoh<00:00:51.870> isn't

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
something also we see that ipoh isn't

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.060 
something also we see that ipoh isn't
discouraged<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:54.379> figuring<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
discouraged about figuring out that the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
discouraged about figuring out that the
dempsey<00:00:56.430> role<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:57.719> compared<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
dempsey role is compared to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
dempsey role is compared to
counters<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:59.010> why<00:00:59.190> he<00:00:59.340> can't<00:00:59.579> fight<00:00:59.969> miata

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
counters that's why he can't fight miata

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
counters that's why he can't fight miata
and<00:01:01.020> Miata<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> beast<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.250> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and Miata is a beast right now so we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240 
and Miata is a beast right now so we
also<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.820> uh<00:01:05.930> his<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.229> friend<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
also see uh his good friend going for a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.560 
also see uh his good friend going for a
championship<00:01:09.119> belt<00:01:09.450> his<00:01:09.780> fellow<00:01:10.260> uh<00:01:11.299> Jim<00:01:12.299> mate

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
championship belt his fellow uh Jim mate

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.130 
championship belt his fellow uh Jim mate
and<00:01:12.990> he<00:01:13.650> goes<00:01:13.830> skinny<00:01:14.250> from<00:01:14.729> fat<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:15.659> normal

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and he goes skinny from fat from normal

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740 
and he goes skinny from fat from normal
and<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> end<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.970> him<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.299> naked

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and at the end you see him like naked

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
and at the end you see him like naked
and<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:21.049> hope<00:01:22.670> they<00:01:23.670> slowed<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> down

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and so I hope they slowed it down

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
and so I hope they slowed it down
now<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.080> don't<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.439> how<00:01:25.500> many<00:01:25.560> episodes<00:01:25.770> there

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
now I don't know how many episodes there

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
now I don't know how many episodes there
are<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.640> season<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> might<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.360> 24<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
are in this season it might be 24 it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.420 
are in this season it might be 24 it
might<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.740> quite<00:01:28.979> sure<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.250> don't

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
might not be I'm not quite sure I don't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
might not be I'm not quite sure I don't
remember<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> only<00:01:31.350> reason

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
remember but I think the only reason

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.179 
remember but I think the only reason
they<00:01:32.070> rush<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:33.020> seems<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.500> rushing<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
they rush or seems like it's rushing is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
they rush or seems like it's rushing is
because<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.939> hundred<00:01:36.600> volumes<00:01:37.049> out

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
because they have a hundred volumes out

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
because they have a hundred volumes out
of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> manga<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> thousand<00:01:39.479> plus

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
of the manga like a thousand plus

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
of the manga like a thousand plus
chapters<00:01:40.259> could<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> imagine<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.159> that's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
chapters could you imagine that that's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
chapters could you imagine that that's
so<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.450> finally<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> season

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
so much and they finally got a season

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
so much and they finally got a season
three<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.579> they're<00:01:44.759> probably<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.299> oh<00:01:45.509> yeah

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
three so they're probably like oh yeah

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
three so they're probably like oh yeah
we<00:01:46.049> got<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.290> put<00:01:46.439> out<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.890> light<00:01:47.189> as

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
we got to put out as much light as

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.039 
we got to put out as much light as
possible<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.090> people<00:01:48.240> watch<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
possible so people watch this for the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
possible so people watch this for the
fights<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.890> sort<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.340> that's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
fights like that sort of thing that's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
fights like that sort of thing that's
what<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.659> least<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.229> guessing<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.159> keep

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
what at least I'm guessing if they keep

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
what at least I'm guessing if they keep
going<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> path<00:01:54.450> they're<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.899> now

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
going down the path they're going now

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.240 
going down the path they're going now
and<00:01:55.939> we<00:01:56.939> also<00:01:57.090> see<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.450> uh<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.350> mention<00:01:59.159> my
