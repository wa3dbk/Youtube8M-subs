sounds to me like you're saying that the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
sounds to me like you're saying that the
hair<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.679> drawing<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.130> terms<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.520> condition<00:00:33.090> or

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of them if the hair is very dry in terms

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
of them if the hair is very dry in terms
of<00:00:39.390> conditioning<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.800> mean

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
of conditioning and you know what I mean

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
of conditioning and you know what I mean
it's<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.160> hair<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> dry<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.540> very

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it's that hair that you dry it's very

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's that hair that you dry it's very
dry<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.620> cut<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.190> blow-dry<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
dry and you cut it then you blow-dry it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
dry and you cut it then you blow-dry it
and<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> lines<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and you see all the lines and it just

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
and you see all the lines and it just
kind<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> sticks<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.520> couple<00:00:48.059> things

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
kind of sticks out at you couple things

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
kind of sticks out at you couple things
I'm<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.420> recommend<00:00:48.750> number<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.770> cut<00:00:50.100> with

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I'm gonna recommend number one cut with

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
I'm gonna recommend number one cut with
zigzag<00:00:50.640> sections<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> take<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
zigzag sections so when I want to take a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
zigzag sections so when I want to take a
horizontal<00:00:52.920> zigzag<00:00:53.610> section<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.539> simply

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
horizontal zigzag section you simply

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
horizontal zigzag section you simply
call<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.170> back<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> grain<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
call them back so you get the grain of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.860 
call them back so you get the grain of
the<00:00:56.309> hair<00:00:56.340> working<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> bring<00:00:57.719> your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the hair working with you bring your

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.680 
the hair working with you bring your
comb<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.230> vertically<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.850> move<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
comb in vertically and then move the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
comb in vertically and then move the
white<00:01:00.930> teeth<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.370> up

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
white teeth up and down up and down up

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
white teeth up and down up and down up
and<00:01:02.850> down<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.270> down<00:01:03.449> slice<00:01:04.320> your<00:01:04.530> finger

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and down up and down slice your finger

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
and down up and down slice your finger
and<00:01:05.070> well<00:01:05.280> ah<00:01:05.489> you've<00:01:05.790> been<00:01:05.909> able<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> create<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and well ah you've been able to create a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
and well ah you've been able to create a
zigzag<00:01:07.260> section<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.280> imagine<00:01:08.549> lifting<00:01:09.119> this

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
zigzag section now imagine lifting this

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.320 
zigzag section now imagine lifting this
up<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> layering<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.729> happens<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
up and layering this now what happens is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
up and layering this now what happens is
it<00:01:12.600> doesn't<00:01:13.049> fall<00:01:13.229> blunt<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.189> fall

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it doesn't fall blunt it's gonna fall

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.940 
it doesn't fall blunt it's gonna fall
with<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:15.090> soft<00:01:15.450> edge<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
with a very soft edge to it you see the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
with a very soft edge to it you see the
last<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> dry

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
last thing you want to do with that dry

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.350 
last thing you want to do with that dry
hair<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.110> stiff<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
hair that's very stiff you don't want to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.330 
hair that's very stiff you don't want to
cut<00:01:21.540> blunt<00:01:21.869> hard<00:01:22.259> lines<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.220> gonna

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
cut blunt hard lines it's just gonna

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
cut blunt hard lines it's just gonna
make<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> lot<00:01:23.790> stiffer<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.689> number<00:01:24.900> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
make it a lot stiffer that's number one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
make it a lot stiffer that's number one
number<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.509> after<00:01:27.509> you've

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
number two would be this after you've

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
number two would be this after you've
done<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.110> zigzag<00:01:28.740> section<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> cut<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.700> line

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
done a zigzag section you cut your line

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
done a zigzag section you cut your line
you<00:01:30.329> might<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> soften<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.350> even<00:01:31.619> more

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you might want to soften out even more

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.490 
you might want to soften out even more
so<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> suggest<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.360> thin<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
so I'm going to suggest you thin and you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
so I'm going to suggest you thin and you
point<00:01:34.829> cut<00:01:35.070> deep<00:01:35.369> into<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.909> when<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.720> sand

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
point cut deep into this when you sand

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.069 
point cut deep into this when you sand
this<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.070> take<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.549> longer<00:01:39.240> shear<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
this and you take your longer shear to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.870 
this and you take your longer shear to
work<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.740> particular<00:01:40.890> case<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
work with in this particular case the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
work with in this particular case the
dry<00:01:42.119> cutting<00:01:42.509> seven-inch<00:01:42.960> watch<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.320> I'm
