in<00:00:58.440> our<00:00:58.680> society<00:00:59.359> that<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.570> split-second

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
in our society that in split-second

situations where people having to make
quick<00:01:03.390> decisions<00:01:03.830> that<00:01:05.810> studies<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.990> shown

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
quick decisions that studies have shown

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
threatening which puts them in more

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
vulnerable positions young

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.050

african-american<00:01:14.400> males<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.729> typically

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
african-american males are typically

african-american males are typically
seen<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.270> older<00:01:15.810> than<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.560> lot

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
seen as older than they are and so a lot

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.300 
seen as older than they are and so a lot
of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.990> solve<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> improve

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
of the way to solve this is to improve

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.090 
of the way to solve this is to improve
training<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.030> people<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.600> aware<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.229> their

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
training so people can be aware of their

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969 
training so people can be aware of their
biases<00:01:26.520> ahead<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.530> when<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
biases ahead of time and when I was in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.060 
biases ahead of time and when I was in
the<00:01:29.100> state<00:01:29.280> legislature<00:01:29.850> back<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.900> Illinois

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the state legislature back in Illinois

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
the state legislature back in Illinois
for<00:01:32.070> example<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> passed<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.030> racial<00:01:33.780> profiling

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
for example I passed a racial profiling

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.910 
for example I passed a racial profiling
bill<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.189> essentially<00:01:36.530> said<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.829> we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bill it essentially said how are we

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
bill it essentially said how are we
going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> tackle<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.490> problem<00:01:38.729> let's<00:01:39.329> make

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
going to tackle this problem let's make

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.770 
going to tackle this problem let's make
sure<00:01:39.600> we're<00:01:39.930> keeping<00:01:40.500> track<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.820> race<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
sure we're keeping track of the race of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.639 
sure we're keeping track of the race of
everybody<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:43.979> being<00:01:44.189> stopped<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
everybody that was being stopped and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.780 
everybody that was being stopped and
just<00:01:46.649> by<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> small<00:01:48.590> fix<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.829> keeping<00:01:50.579> track

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just by the small fix of keeping track

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
just by the small fix of keeping track
suddenly<00:01:51.299> each<00:01:51.479> cop<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.200> were<00:01:52.259> about

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
suddenly each cop when they were about

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.080 
suddenly each cop when they were about
to<00:01:52.770> make<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> traffic<00:01:53.189> stop<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.700> had<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.909> think

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to make a traffic stop they had to think

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
to make a traffic stop they had to think
okay<00:01:54.390> am<00:01:54.689> i<00:01:55.079> stopping<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.590> person<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
okay am i stopping this person because I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
okay am i stopping this person because I
should<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.880> stopping<00:01:57.240> them<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.930> some<00:01:58.649> bias

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
should be stopping them or is some bias

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.109 
should be stopping them or is some bias
at<00:01:59.070> work<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.759> kind<00:02:00.030> of

at work and just that kind of

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
at work and just that kind of
mindfulness<00:02:00.780> about<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.259> ended<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.250> resulting

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
mindfulness about it ended up resulting

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
mindfulness about it ended up resulting
in<00:02:02.939> better<00:02:04.250> data<00:02:05.250> better<00:02:05.969> policing<00:02:06.360> more

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
in better data better policing more
