00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello dear friends 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.620
 you know there is a wonderful joke when the bum 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 I was going to hang myself full of hopelessness 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.320
 looking bull he was going to the toilet 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.740
 bull hung behind the toilet but it is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.019
 goby lit his top beer bottle not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.130
 before the property stands a corner and thinks a 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.330
 life is something that's just as well adjusted 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 capital flight from Russia 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.190
 if being politically correct then pure 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.890
 private capital outflow in the first 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 quarter decreased by half times 1 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.700
 quarter of last year was forty seven and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.680
 seven tenths of a billion dollars ran away 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.440
 From Russia now only 32.6 billion 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 while reducing the current everywhere in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.640
 banking sector at 30 percent outflow 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.460
 declined from twenty one billion 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 to 14.6 billion and financial sector 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.340
 on third from 26 7 2 17 billion exactly well 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 only black capital which is absolutely 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.920
 criminals who move in 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 non-public field of vision was 5 9 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 has become 5.7 billion dollars from the place 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.780
 capital shrinks right 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.250
 compare over the same 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 last year's period is just very 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
 seasonal phenomenon but it is possible for consolation 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 to finally feel 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 such a homeless one is getting better 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.330
 life compare to fourth quarter 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.090
 last year when was currency 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.220
 disaster and flight amounted to 70 7.4 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 billion dollars 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.200
 for some reason, the capital has declined well 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.310
 First of all 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.430
 everyone already ran away everyone already ran away 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.700
 wanted to run away in the country but really not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.259
 money u before capital flight theophilus 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 largely due to external 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.939
 loans 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 Now there are no external loans and run 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.899
 only called free 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 capital and quite a bit of it with one 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.759
 hand on the other hand 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.250
 ruble strengthened for speculators 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.219
 again all speculative schemes were earned 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 when we bring rubles here we bring 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.319
 here in currency convert to rubles 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.870
 grow and then output this circuit will be 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.030
 work at least to the end 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.280
 Julia, that is, there is some influx 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.750
 speculative capital 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.640
 when all sorts of bloomberg tell 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.849
 pipes are better than the currencies of the world this is it 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.349
 have we with you neither hot nor 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.180
 cold because we live in real 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.730
 sector or in the real sector 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.430
 economy except for some part 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:40.370
 office plankton we suffer from a common 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.890
 the economic downturn from the fact that the bank 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.590
 Russia is struggling with inflation by 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.200
 destruction of the economy in my opinion but 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.980
 nonetheless some moral 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.299
 satisfaction is at least 32.6 billion 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.720
 dollars per quarter 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.359
 net private capital outflow is all 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.140
 equally disastrous high 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.299
 in any normal country even in any 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.480
 not a normal country but in a country with 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.790
 normal adequate management even in 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.400
 country normal inadequate 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.700
 control but with control which though 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 would want to achieve something all 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.810
 economic block 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.019
 Well, the leadership of the Bank of Russia is not a fact that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.290
 would be in prison is a matter of court but 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.400
 would look for both work and good 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.650
 our countryâ€™s lawyers are these people 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.849
 continue to lead us and continue 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.480
 iron hand 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:41.750
 let's day us on the state Maidan I 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.879
 I'm afraid that with such an attitude towards them 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.870
 political activity 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.579
 country leaders 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.579
 they will succeed
