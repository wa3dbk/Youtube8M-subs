00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.040
 Ah 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.040
 Ah 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.969
 It is the best player of the jump ball 2012 kb National university basketball Riga at last 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm running out. 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 Three lectures influential 10000000000000000 days Chung-Ang University, Korea University is a center that holds deumjik 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.880
 There's something in common. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 Jang Jae-seo and Young Pyo Seung-gyu to give a national representative center Kim Jong-gyu draft 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.339
 Till 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.659
 This year, each Facing these attacks targeted at forming a total of six games by two games 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.659
 Let's analyze the pattern. 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:45.260
 Poster of the face through the records, minutes, shooting reported in Korea Lee, Seung - Hyun 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.370
 I can see that everyone who walked did not try. 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.120
 Two kinds of data, drag the eye and try to have three players with a 28 hour hand to 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.530
 And the success rate was as high as 60% 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.210
 Further more the long-range shot in the left side and the four augmented Le coat that is left-right 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.960
 Twice about Eddie Cole 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.960
 Success is also 60% on the left, 16% higher on the right 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.880
 I tried a lot of mid-range shots against Jang Dae-suk 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.880
 It's also important to note that the success rate is good . 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.690
 06 Pattern Analysis Lee Seung-yeon has solved the attack with a medium distance shot. 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.000
 The most common lead-up to post 16 times face up to the 13th order 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.980
 It's counted. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.340
 Poster success rate is 38%, which is lower than other players 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.520
 The attempt itself was superior to other players. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.700
 Especially, for Jang Dae-seok, I posted post-up more than twice as much for Kim Jong-gi 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.570
 I tried 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.960
 Face-up I try more than 2 3 times more than other players 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.890
 I can analyze that I was attacked with confidence. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.219
 On the other hand, it can be analyzed that the dependence on Lee Seung- 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.219
 There is 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.789
 Let's take a look at the sharing pattern through video 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.600
 Lee Seung-yeon is often shared attempt from the left side than the right side without post 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.019
 Start with the poster on the left and dribble towards the center of the court rather than the baseline 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.680
 Haetneundeyo bonded enjoy some time surgery left pepper 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.610
 Juvis catches it and strikes the center of the court to defend 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.010
 Visualize the team you need to try to attack the jump rooms, or try the base left 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.569
 The play ended with an attack. 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.440
 In post-up on the right side, there are various attacks 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.440
 I showed you the route . 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.300
 Lee Seung-hyun left - handed , left - handed dribble in the face-up situation 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.240
 I often try to drive . 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.620
 Especially the high post why so the pump fake reason 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.620
 Left drive always tried 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.310
 There are also many scenes where we try to break through the baseline to the left 4 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.310
 I'm out. 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.640
 Overall, drive success is high, but there are few right-hand dribbles 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.640
 Looks like you need security. 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.390
 It is the distribution chart of the Zhang Zen- seok Shootings . 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.950
 There was no medium range shot. 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.160
 It recorded a share from 60% As you can see from the chart on the right Shooting 4 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.730
 I have not attempted to attack once in a while. 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.680
 However, the right center field.That'll area tried to attack the most 12 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.360
 The success rate was 50%. Chiang Kai-shek and Lee Seung-hyun 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.750
 Put in 11 shots. 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.500
 I tried 13 attacks against Kim Jung-kyu . 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.620
 The attempt itself was similar, but the success rate was very different. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.220
 31% share of Lee Seung Yeon 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.110
 Kim Jong-gyu showed a strong figure of 54% 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:52.640
 0 Looking at the pattern, Jang Dae-seok was the most frequently missed league 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.730
 Each poster in the cafe was not even one place 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.030
 All three attempts against Lee Seung-yeol failed him 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.160
 The poster showed a little push in the city fighting 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.240
 It was so tall. 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.840
 The ability to pass, especially thanks to stab started playing basketball as a guard under Paul also 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.840
 I saw it. 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.550
 Considering the position of the 5 Ford Ford Pro 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.150
 We need to diversify our attack routes and practice on face-ups steadily. 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.150
 It seems to do. 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.509
 Sharing pattern analysis via video poster b, especially on the right feldspar Court 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.560
 There was a lot 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:38.229
 Jang Geun-suk dribbles into the center of the court a long time ago without the post 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:41.979
 If you have the right hand, u have finished the attack with a jump shot under shirt 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:45.690
 If you are posting from the left, 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.690
 I tried two weeks to baseline . 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.230
 Face-up is also an attempt in the right middle or right side 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.130
 Many 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.340
 I'll buy a drive dribble to the drive. 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.660
 2 Under the supervisor, one-to-one must develop abilities and broaden the range of action 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.110
 I mean advice 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.110
 Depending on the location or situation, you may need to roll over your right hand. 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.810
 Kim Jong-gyu's shooting analysis Kim Jong-gyu is the main attempt of casting 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.710
 I wrote 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:25.960
 The city of nine trials has a success rate of 5% 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:30.370
 In particular , there were few attempts at both companies and the success rate was only 20% 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.230
 But in the middle of the Universe and the High Post, all four shots 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.460
 You're welcome. 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:40.780
 Kim Jong-gyu tried public service mainly on poster against Jang Dae-seok 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.730
 Whereas this struggle is against such a US Lee Seung Yeon is focused than Chinese food Poster 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.350
 I solved the attack. 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:52.400
 Kim Jong-gyu sued Yp Canon for a card such as Kim Min- su and Kyung Min. 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:57.080
 p su Lee Eun Joo Boy Pop Cam looks I need more practice 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.020
 06 pattern analysis Kim Jun Kyu was also the most experienced casting season 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.840
 I've tried poster four times . 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.009
 Ups since ceased to Pescara 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.949
 Kim Joon-kyu has been in charge of the center from the nursery school. 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:14.330
 Good and success is low. 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:17.229
 Foster also developed b1 last year, but against poisonous Lee Seung Yeon and Jang Dae Suk 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.229
 The success rate is out. 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:30.350
 Analysis of attack patterns through video 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:33.740
 Kim Jong-gyu is a center of excellence in maneuverability and height compared to Jang Dae Seok and Lee Seung Yeon . 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:37.300
 I took the role of a fast trailer 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.300
 There was more black and white . 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.740
 06:00 In the right post conflict this year, perhaps Sue or jump done by the Central Court 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.670
 I finished with only my hands. 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.380
 Also, when you try to play beaver , you tend to attack with your right hand 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:55.360
 I saw it. 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.010
 The weak part of the left-hand society in Foster City is the project of Kim Jong- 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.480
 Homework. 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.770
 Kyunghee University and Chung-Ang University One kelp port in consideration of fluke or champion decision 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.060
 High 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.430
 If you look closely at the attack patterns of the three players analyzed by the jump , 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.750
 Could you watch it more fun? 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.750
 More than a jumpball window
