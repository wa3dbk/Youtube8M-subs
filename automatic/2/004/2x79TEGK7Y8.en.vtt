00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
that many of these days but the thing is

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.320 
that many of these days but the thing is
I<00:03:20.590> mean<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> game<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.670> obviously

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
breaking it up as well it was it pretty

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.909 
breaking it up as well it was it pretty
long<00:04:34.090> they<00:04:34.510> reminded<00:04:34.930> me<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> lot<00:04:35.260> of<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.560> gummi

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
long they reminded me a lot of the gummi

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.560 
long they reminded me a lot of the gummi
ship<00:04:36.250> battles<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.820> Kingdom<00:04:37.090> Hearts<00:04:37.120> right

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
ship battles and Kingdom Hearts right

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.440 
ship battles and Kingdom Hearts right
and<00:04:38.139> uh<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.710> know<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.860> they're<00:04:39.160> fine<00:04:39.520> they<00:04:40.060> do

and uh you know I they're fine they do

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.820 
and uh you know I they're fine they do
their<00:04:40.600> purpose<00:04:41.020> but<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.350> gets<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.650> point

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
their purpose but it gets to the point

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.110 
their purpose but it gets to the point
when<00:04:41.980> you're<00:04:42.070> at<00:04:42.130> like<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.460> third<00:04:42.730> or<00:04:42.850> fourth

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
when you're at like the third or fourth

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.830 
when you're at like the third or fourth
one<00:04:43.419> it<00:04:43.930> kind<00:04:44.139> of<00:04:44.169> like<00:04:44.320> okay<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.680> get<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.860> point

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
one it kind of like okay I get the point

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.740 
one it kind of like okay I get the point
clink<00:04:46.840> hop<00:04:47.290> on<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.620> turret<00:04:48.570> they<00:04:49.570> actually

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
clink hop on that turret they actually

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.710 
clink hop on that turret they actually
lets<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:50.620> control<00:04:51.100> Clank<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.360> turret

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
lets you control Clank and in a turret

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.409 
lets you control Clank and in a turret
in<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.870> back<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.950> found<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.970> if<00:04:55.270> I

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
in the back and I found that I if I

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.420 
in the back and I found that I if I
didn't<00:04:55.690> shoot<00:04:55.870> any<00:04:56.110> enemies<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.830> can<00:04:57.010> still<00:04:57.280> get

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
didn't shoot any enemies I can still get

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.550 
didn't shoot any enemies I can still get
past<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:57.880> part<00:04:58.150> right<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:59.050> it's<00:04:59.200> weird<00:04:59.440> i'm

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
past that part right and it's weird i'm

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.920 
past that part right and it's weird i'm
like<00:04:59.710> why<00:05:00.130> what<00:05:00.639> even<00:05:00.970> let<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.540> play<00:05:01.780> as

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
like why what even let you play as

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.770 
like why what even let you play as
clanking<00:05:02.440> at<00:05:02.590> his<00:05:03.160> point<00:05:03.550> or<00:05:03.820> is<00:05:04.180> his<00:05:04.389> part<00:05:04.690> is

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
clanking at his point or is his part is

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.280 
clanking at his point or is his part is
basically<00:05:05.410> pointless<00:05:09.930> there's<00:05:10.930> certain

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
basically pointless there's certain

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.020 
basically pointless there's certain
weapons<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.919> just<00:05:12.220> grew<00:05:12.400> attached<00:05:12.760> to

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
weapons that I just grew attached to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.730 
weapons that I just grew attached to
that<00:05:13.210> we're<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:13.570> useful<00:05:14.050> for<00:05:14.320> instance<00:05:14.650> the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
that we're so useful for instance the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.440 
that we're so useful for instance the
lightning<00:05:15.280> ravager<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:15.850> think<00:05:16.150> it's<00:05:16.270> what<00:05:16.360> is

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
lightning ravager I think it's what is

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.390 
lightning ravager I think it's what is
clogged<00:05:16.660> rather<00:05:16.960> than<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.200> shock<00:05:17.410> ravager<00:05:17.919> it's

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
clogged rather than a shock ravager it's

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.159 
clogged rather than a shock ravager it's
like<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.610> basically<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.510> lightning<00:05:19.990> whip

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
like a basically like a lightning whip

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.830 
like a basically like a lightning whip
and<00:05:20.410> it<00:05:20.560> can<00:05:20.710> take<00:05:20.889> out<00:05:21.100> enemies<00:05:21.550> an<00:05:22.540> entire

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and it can take out enemies an entire

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.990 
and it can take out enemies an entire
radius<00:05:23.350> around<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.280> there's<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:24.820> lot<00:05:24.940> of

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
radius around you so there's a lot of

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.670 
radius around you so there's a lot of
times<00:05:25.300> all<00:05:25.810> these<00:05:25.930> little<00:05:26.200> critters<00:05:26.440> will

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
times all these little critters will

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.350 
times all these little critters will
come<00:05:26.860> running<00:05:27.010> at<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:28.090> need<00:05:28.270> to

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:43.619 
weapons that I was able to just go

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:53.910 
weapons that I was able to just go
through<00:05:43.829> an<00:05:43.919> upgrade<00:05:44.249> random<00:05:44.579> weapons

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.200 

it's<00:05:54.920> like<00:05:55.040> those<00:05:55.220> subtle<00:05:55.580> things<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:56.090> you

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
it's like those subtle things that you

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.760 
it's like those subtle things that you
might<00:05:56.360> not<00:05:56.540> notice<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:57.050> first<00:05:57.260> time<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:57.530> play

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.800 
might not notice the first time you play
it<00:05:57.950> but<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.580> think<00:05:58.670> that's<00:05:58.940> why<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.360> ratchet

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
it but I think that's why the ratchet

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.540 
it but I think that's why the ratchet
game<00:05:59.930> is<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:00.230> out<00:06:00.440> of<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.680> series<00:06:01.040> itself<00:06:01.220> is

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
game is so out of the series itself is

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.250 
game is so out of the series itself is
so<00:06:01.700> successful<00:06:01.910> is<00:06:02.660> because<00:06:02.810> there's<00:06:03.140> all

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
so successful is because there's all

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.570 
so successful is because there's all
these<00:06:03.350> little<00:06:03.410> sell<00:06:03.830> things<00:06:04.070> that<00:06:04.250> they<00:06:04.340> put
