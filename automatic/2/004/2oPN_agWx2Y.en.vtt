00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.809
 products and characterized by the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.279
 le touch screen notebook technology 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.140
 reasons as if we start from v5 a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.360
 product and mainstream characterized then 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.110
 from the 15 inch touch screen six 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.000
 a light and thin product is not not 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.430
 can be considered an ultrabook 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 because not inside a disk is 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.640
 solid state ssd but enjoys the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 features of always connected 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.980
 hence the ability to reconnect to a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.859
 previously stored ip address 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.809

 like what we see in this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
 time or with your site 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.270
 of black color 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.690
 the main configurations of this 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.989
 model with an intel core processor 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.869
 from the trio now the third generation files 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.350
 which graphics cards nvidia of last 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.869
 generation from the gt 640 that allows 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.570
 graphics performance also to facilitate 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.690
 touch and product technology 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 if instead we move on products in the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.700
 an ultrabook category the first that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.690
 we meet in over 15 inches and 6 that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.360
 the action of the series m 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.130
 particular this is to admit that one 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.080
 black screen chassis 15 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.550
 inches and 6 configurations that can 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.660

 server prices starting from 599 euros 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.510
 being ultrabook competitive state solid 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.120
 can have configurations with the hard 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.880
 hybrid disk then 500gb of hard disk e 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.020
 plus the 20 gb of ssd to allow the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.900
 functions of an instant on 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.080
 or a totally ssd configuration 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.640
 128 GB or 256 GB 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.390

 11 inches and 6 13 3 yes 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.329
 difference especially for materials 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:33.810
 of which it is built in the first place 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:36.490
 outer part which is formed by a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.850

 had already introduced in the ultrabook s5 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.000
 hence the generation ultrabook 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:29.080
 previous let's say so and then usb ports
