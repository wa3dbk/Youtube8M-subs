00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
remember with this exercise the first is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.780 
remember with this exercise the first is
to<00:00:12.990> play<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.410> nice<00:00:13.650> consistent<00:00:14.370> long

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
string bow and the second is to drop the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.310 
string bow and the second is to drop the
fingers<00:00:18.090> from<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.660> height<00:00:18.869> onto<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
fingers from a bit of a height onto the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.890 
fingers from a bit of a height onto the
fingerboard<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.640> accurate<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
fingerboard want to be accurate but you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.849 
fingerboard want to be accurate but you
also<00:00:22.020> want<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> little<00:00:22.619> bit<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
also want to have a little bit of a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.150 
also want to have a little bit of a
weight<00:00:23.070> behind<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.699> fingers<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.330> land

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
weight behind the fingers as they land

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
weight behind the fingers as they land
the<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> use<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.880> exercise<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.750> by

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the way to use this exercise is by

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
the way to use this exercise is by
starting<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.740> by<00:00:28.949> playing<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.789> note<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
starting out by playing one note at a

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.670 
starting out by playing one note at a
time<00:00:30.390> very<00:00:31.109> slowly<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.160> note<00:00:32.460> per<00:00:32.669> bow

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
time very slowly with one note per bow

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
time very slowly with one note per bow
you'll<00:00:34.680> note<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> there<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.280> repeat<00:00:35.880> signs

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you'll note that there are repeat signs

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.299 
you'll note that there are repeat signs
on<00:00:36.360> either<00:00:36.510> side<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.230> measure<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
on either side of the measure so you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
on either side of the measure so you
want<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> repeat<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> measure<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.390> few<00:00:39.660> times

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
want to repeat the measure a few times

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.040 
want to repeat the measure a few times
until<00:00:40.200> they're<00:00:40.290> comfortable<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.010> speed

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
until they're comfortable at that speed

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.760 
until they're comfortable at that speed
then<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.559> double<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> speed<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> piece

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
then you double the speed of the piece

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.930 
then you double the speed of the piece
playing<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:47.129> notes<00:00:47.399> per<00:00:47.550> bow<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.320> shown<00:00:49.320> here

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
playing two notes per bow as shown here

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.100 
playing two notes per bow as shown here
once<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.090> comfortable<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.750> speed

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
once you're comfortable at that speed

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.290 
once you're comfortable at that speed
you<00:00:52.320> again<00:00:52.890> double<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> tempo<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.000> piece

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you again double the tempo of the piece

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.279 
you again double the tempo of the piece
playing<00:00:55.110> four<00:00:55.469> notes<00:00:55.500> per<00:00:55.860> bow<00:00:57.170> once<00:00:58.170> you're

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

comfortable<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.859> speed<00:00:59.160> double<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
comfortable at that speed double it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.110 
comfortable at that speed double it
again<00:01:00.120> playing<00:01:00.600> eighth<00:01:00.930> notes<00:01:00.960> per<00:01:01.440> bow<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
again playing eighth notes per bow and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
again playing eighth notes per bow and
continue<00:01:03.120> doubling<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> speed<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
continue doubling the speed and the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
continue doubling the speed and the
number<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> notes<00:01:05.129> per<00:01:05.400> bow<00:01:05.600> until<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
number of notes per bow until it's at a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.660 
number of notes per bow until it's at a
speed<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.740> can't<00:01:07.979> play<00:01:08.189> any<00:01:08.220> faster
