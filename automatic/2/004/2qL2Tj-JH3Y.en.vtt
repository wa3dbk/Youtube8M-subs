to place the surf and then afterwards

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.460 
to place the surf and then afterwards
you<00:00:26.369> know<00:00:26.480> round<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:27.689> where<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> ball<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you know round about where the ball is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.099 
you know round about where the ball is
coming<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.279> making<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.970> service<00:00:30.480> up

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
coming if I'm making with up service up

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
coming if I'm making with up service up
spin<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.219> expecting<00:00:32.910> flip<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.510> then<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
spin then I'm expecting flip and then I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.830 
spin then I'm expecting flip and then I
know<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.920> my<00:00:34.950> mind<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.520> normally<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> will

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
know in my mind that normally I will

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.100 
know in my mind that normally I will
play<00:00:37.350> against<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> flip<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.390> why<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
play against the flip so that's why you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
play against the flip so that's why you
think<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.680> play<00:00:40.890> down<00:00:41.160> spin<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> know

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
think if I play down spin then you know

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.090 
think if I play down spin then you know
he<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.239> normally<00:00:42.719> push<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
he will normally push and then you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.170 
he will normally push and then you
prepare<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.469> push<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.879> have

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
prepare for for for push and so you have

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
prepare for for for push and so you have
in<00:00:48.450> mind<00:00:48.660> before<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.320> make<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> service<00:00:50.129> what

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
in mind before you make the service what

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.470 
in mind before you make the service what
will<00:00:50.489> come<00:00:50.700> after<00:00:52.910> me<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.969> tries<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
will come after me is tries to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
will come after me is tries to
anticipate<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.379> opponent<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.160> return

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
anticipate how the opponent will return

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
anticipate how the opponent will return
his<00:00:56.760> service<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.199> move<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
his service so that he can move for the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
his service so that he can move for the
third<00:00:58.949> ball<00:00:59.219> attack<00:00:59.550> faster<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.870> hit<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
third ball attack faster and can hit the

in order to win more points with the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.680 
in order to win more points with the
third<00:01:10.620> wall<00:01:10.860> attack<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.730> combination<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
service with the next stroke is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
service with the next stroke is
important<00:01:15.000> let's<00:01:15.870> see<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.230> maze<00:01:16.470> achieves

important let's see how maze achieves
this<00:01:17.190> goal

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.890 

it's<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.820> very<00:01:26.060> different<00:01:27.610> it's<00:01:28.689> depending<00:01:29.689> who

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
it's a very different it's depending who
