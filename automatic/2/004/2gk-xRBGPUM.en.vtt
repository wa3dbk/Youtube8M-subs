words this thing has definitely set up

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
words this thing has definitely set up
to<00:01:33.720> race<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.890> drops<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to race this thing actually drops in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
to race this thing actually drops in
grabs<00:01:35.970> rather<00:01:36.360> than<00:01:36.689> scooting<00:01:37.229> across<00:01:37.350> or

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
grabs rather than scooting across or

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.310 
grabs rather than scooting across or
hopping<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.810> drops<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
hopping and and it just really drops the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830 
hopping and and it just really drops the
rear<00:01:40.500> end<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.189> grabs<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.729> goes<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.659> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.149 
original miles but that's over 20,000
times<00:01:58.409> down<00:01:59.659> exactly<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.860> does<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
times down exactly right but it does it

the<00:02:02.399> spoiler<00:02:02.759> looks<00:02:02.969> looks<00:02:03.360> higher<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.750> looks

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the spoiler looks looks higher it looks

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.569 
the spoiler looks looks higher it looks
like<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> was<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.770> extended<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.460> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
like that was that was extended up a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.850 
like that was that was extended up a
couple<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.969> inches<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> always<00:02:07.560> thought

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
couple of inches so I always thought

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.350 
couple of inches so I always thought
that<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.160> gave<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> really<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.119> neat

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that that gave a really really neat

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
that that gave a really really neat
appeal<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> rear<00:02:10.560> end<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.920> car

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
appeal to to the rear end of this car

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.670 
appeal to to the rear end of this car
and<00:02:11.970> they<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.569> look<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.959> aggressive

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and they just look so aggressive

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.410 
and they just look so aggressive
you<00:02:14.340> know<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.609> but<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:14.939> makes<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.269> as

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you know but but what makes it as

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.759 
you know but but what makes it as
aggressive<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.260> we've<00:02:16.349> talked

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
aggressive as it is and we've talked

aggressive as it is and we've talked
about<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.129> many<00:02:17.219> motion<00:02:17.609> cars<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.909> got<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.239> see

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
about so many motion cars I got to see

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.940 
about so many motion cars I got to see
one<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.599> these<00:02:18.719> engines<00:02:18.900> okay<00:02:19.379> let's<00:02:19.769> take<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
one of these engines okay let's take a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.470 
one of these engines okay let's take a
look<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.290> was<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.700> full-blown<00:02:23.700> phase

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
look so this was a full-blown phase

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
look so this was a full-blown phase
three<00:02:24.900> treatment<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.409> this<00:02:25.530> car<00:02:25.769> phase<00:02:26.159> three

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
three treatment on this car phase three

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.059 
three treatment on this car phase three
treatment<00:02:27.319> one<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.500> things<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.829> love<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
treatment one of the things I love is

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.129 
treatment one of the things I love is
the<00:02:29.370> l88<00:02:29.760> hood<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.420> thing<00:02:30.689> I<00:02:30.840> think<00:02:31.049> it

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
the l88 hood on this thing I think it

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.830 
the l88 hood on this thing I think it
gives<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.739> car<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.280> Camaro<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.209> attitude<00:02:33.659> oh

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the motion cam in it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.129 
the motion cam in it
you've<00:02:41.639> got<00:02:41.819> that'll<00:02:42.209> Brock<00:02:42.389> high-rise<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.870> a

you've got that'll Brock high-rise on a
Luna<00:02:43.620> high-rise<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.370> nice<00:02:44.609> valve<00:02:45.389> covers

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
Luna high-rise this nice valve covers

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.629 
Luna high-rise this nice valve covers
there<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> motion<00:02:46.260> chrome<00:02:46.620> valve<00:02:46.859> button<00:02:47.189> mm

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
there the motion chrome valve button mm

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.050 
there the motion chrome valve button mm
valve<00:02:48.150> covers<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.870> big<00:02:49.489> massive<00:02:50.489> radiator<00:02:50.939> on

valve covers and big massive radiator on

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.729 
valve covers and big massive radiator on
these<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.359> mean<00:02:51.450> these<00:02:51.599> things<00:02:51.659> were<00:02:51.900> just

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
these I mean these things were just

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.679 
these I mean these things were just
built<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.609> flat-out<00:02:53.879> fly

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
built to just flat-out fly

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.149 
built to just flat-out fly
yeah<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.379> was<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.709> whole<00:02:55.889> motion

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
yeah and that was the whole motion

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.949 
yeah and that was the whole motion
mystique<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.909> that<00:02:57.060> he<00:02:57.150> built<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.540> cars<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
mystique is that he built the cars and

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.270 
mystique is that he built the cars and
they<00:02:58.079> came<00:02:58.260> with<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:58.469> guarantee<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.159> they

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
they came with a guarantee that they

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.800 
they came with a guarantee that they
would<00:02:59.400> run<00:02:59.609> in<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.849> 11<00:03:00.209> seconds<00:03:00.629> in<00:03:00.719> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
would run in the 11 seconds in the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.050 
would run in the 11 seconds in the
quarter<00:03:00.989> mile<00:03:01.319> with<00:03:01.530> 120<00:03:02.280> mile<00:03:02.430> top-end

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
quarter mile with 120 mile top-end

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.670 
quarter mile with 120 mile top-end
so<00:03:03.359> most<00:03:03.629> people<00:03:03.750> are<00:03:03.959> pretty<00:03:04.109> happy<00:03:04.469> with<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
so most people are pretty happy with the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.039 
so most people are pretty happy with the
