00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
can kind of go in you can get a little

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
can kind of go in you can get a little
practice<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.430> helps<00:00:26.760> Oh<00:00:26.970> without<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
practice in and it helps Oh without a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that i played this st. Andrews was the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
that i played this st. Andrews was the
first<00:00:32.040> time<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.279> actually<00:00:32.579> even<00:00:33.059> went<00:00:33.300> over

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
first time I actually even went over

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
first time I actually even went over
there<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.350> played<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> game

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
there to see it and I played the game

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
there to see it and I played the game
and<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> course<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> night

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and I got to see the course so a night

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.600 
and I got to see the course so a night
went<00:00:37.380> over<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.489> bit

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
went over there it was a little bit

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.069 
went over there it was a little bit
easier<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.270> already<00:00:39.390> saw<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> course

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
easier because i already saw the course

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
easier because i already saw the course
i<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:41.010> definitely<00:00:41.340> say<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.149> was

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
i would definitely say that it was

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
i would definitely say that it was
authentic<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> golf<00:00:43.020> swing<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.469> mean<00:00:43.620> you're

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
authentic to a golf swing I mean you're

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.410 
authentic to a golf swing I mean you're
holding<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> you're<00:00:44.789> swinging<00:00:45.210> at<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
holding it and you're swinging at the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
holding it and you're swinging at the
pace<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.989> want<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> can

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
pace that you want to go and you can

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340 
pace that you want to go and you can
control<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:47.969> far<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> goes<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
control how far it goes I think that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.779 
control how far it goes I think that
that<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> neatest<00:00:50.489> part

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that is the probably the neatest part

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.549 
that is the probably the neatest part
about<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.289> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
about it is you're so much more in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
about it is you're so much more in
control<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.879> realistic<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
control of it it's so realistic and the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
control of it it's so realistic and the
fact<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.620> play<00:00:55.949> golf<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.579> see

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
fact that I do play golf and I can see

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
fact that I do play golf and I can see
the<00:00:56.879> golf<00:00:57.090> courses<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.289> would<00:00:58.440> entice<00:00:58.859> me

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the golf courses I think would entice me

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
the golf courses I think would entice me
to<00:00:59.160> try<00:00:59.910> new<00:01:00.059> things<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> can

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to try new things I think that you can

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
to try new things I think that you can
learn<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> lot<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> can

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
learn a lot from this I think you can

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
learn a lot from this I think you can
take<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.960> learn<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> video<00:01:04.470> game<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
take what you learn the video game and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
take what you learn the video game and
take<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> golf<00:01:05.939> course<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.479> teaches

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
take it to the golf course it teaches

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.289 
take it to the golf course it teaches
you<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.350> posture<00:01:07.860> choosing<00:01:08.250> clubs<00:01:08.520> knowing

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you your posture choosing clubs knowing

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
you your posture choosing clubs knowing
that<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.080> play<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that you have to actually play for the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
that you have to actually play for the
winds<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> looking<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.850> brakes<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.450> greens<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
winds and looking at brakes on greens so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.510 
winds and looking at brakes on greens so
your<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.530> time<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.280> wouldn't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
your first time out there you wouldn't

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
your first time out there you wouldn't
be<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> water<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.259> would

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
be you know out of water it would

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.510 
be you know out of water it would
actually<00:01:16.560> understand<00:01:17.310> what

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
actually understand what

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
actually understand what
you're<00:01:17.640> doing<00:01:20.450> well<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.600> actual<00:01:22.109> natural

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you're doing well my actual natural

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.529 
you're doing well my actual natural
tendency<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.399> draw<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.670> ball<00:01:23.939> hit

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
tendency is that you draw the ball hit

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.899 
tendency is that you draw the ball hit
right<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> left<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.469> playing<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.429> game<00:01:26.640> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
right to left so playing the game I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
right to left so playing the game I
definitely<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.719> pulling<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> more<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.590> what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
definitely was pulling it more than what

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
definitely was pulling it more than what
I<00:01:28.740> wanted<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.700> does<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.240> helps<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> feel

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
I wanted and it does it helps you feel

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
I wanted and it does it helps you feel
where<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.259> hands<00:01:31.649> are<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.399> think<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
where your hands are and I think that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
where your hands are and I think that
