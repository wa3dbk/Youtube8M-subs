00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.000
 we say welcome to 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.980
 today's press conference before our 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.150
 home game on sunday against the sv 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.300
 Darmstadt 98 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 we expect 16,000 spectators in our office 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.880
 Stadion 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.070
 We ask everyone on sunday one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.920
 early arrival because not only around 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.140
 around the stadium a lot going on but in Fürth 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.449
 or on the way to will also 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.279
 a bike race takes place because of that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.260
 the police asked us too 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.230
 to align and to all fans one 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.760
 early arrival to the heart 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 we hereby also like to do 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.420
 Referee is not sure yet 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 Then we like to submit and then 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 may i welcome your trainer mike 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 büskens and mike you on your 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.649
 outlook on sunday ever or 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.969
 ask for your outlook 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.020
 So I think that the darmstadt for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 us also an exemplary for all of us 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.980
 example is how bissig a club 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.660
 has fought out one after all 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 extremely precarious and difficult 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.890
 situations with one with a descent 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 from the third league only through 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.679
 failed to grant the license 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.569
 They prevent the crash as they like 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.810
 They then made the turnaround 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:24.810
 with the rise now with one with 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.550
 a situation that she also insists 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.319
 hope to make it through the march 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.270
 that's what I think is exemplary 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:36.149
 is actually sensational there 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.280
 you too with how much heart and soul in there 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.979
 dARMSTADT 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.970
 is worked day by day and therefore 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.569
 is it for German football? 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.789
 a very special example is that 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.390
 is a team for us from our perspective 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:02:00.090
 what a lot with a lot of long balls 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.369
 what the second balls are going to do 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.950
 They also permanently pressurize you 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.440
 put in their own construction the try 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.730
 we always make stress 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.950
 in ball possession, the deep search quickly 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.010
 fast 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.330
 the danger in the other half 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.470
 shift 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.030
 about one over a direct deep 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.739
 ball 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 those who do not shy away from the fight 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.370
 permanently everything everything throw in something 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.400
 in them that means for us 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.530
 that we have to cross borders 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.150
 So do not limit yourself 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.519
 So learn is not that of me 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.250
 wrong but that we understand ours 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.590
 we have to move our borders 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.970
 these situations have to face that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.090
 we are not just what we do 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.650
 running performance relates to one 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.620
 need extraordinary performance 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.420
 but also what that accept 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.920
 of what are they fighting 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.049
 Assertiveness in the battles 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.540
 As we said, we have to do ours 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.610
 crossing borders next year 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.110
 Sunday 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.329
 Thanks a lot then we come to all 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.950
 ask also today we ask for one 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.280
 hand signal for the micro to reach 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.280
 can be 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.690
 martin funk to what extent can you in the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.769
 moment even on the training at all 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.540
 if you go to the training 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.829
 You can see that almost everyone observes 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.989
 fourth player wants to have the ball 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.160
 that's exactly what it's all about in the game 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.540
 problem that many do not even the ball 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.040
 rather want to hide the ones 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.480
 Body language is quite another we 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.880
 keep talking about this from time to time 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.319
 This head story is on the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.190
 training course in these days ever 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.970
 trainable for you that is so far 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.489
 trainable that you that you situation 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.450
 from the game that could expect us 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.859
 simulates that the guys know what 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.200
 what will it be in these situations? 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.170
 but you are of course right 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.599
 the team again today very much 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.250
 have a bit very dedicated to them 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.230
 Pushed each other and that is 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.130
 These are things you need to take with you 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.030
 on the field 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.480
 they have to transfer because because as 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.799
 said it comes that we our 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.859
 move boundaries 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.380
 and there when I talk about it 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.760
 so many components too 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.890
 this mutual support this 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.160
 this sense of responsibility for the 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.690
 whole team for the whole club and and 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.210
 there we have to get out of this mode where 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.100
 we where partly we then very much with 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.630
 the walls are busy for us 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.370
 the space that also addressed 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.890
 before heidenheim what is going on now 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.480
 maybe the darmstadt will be different 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.710
 they are still comparable games 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.180
 until you like to fight in but 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.110
 play relatively similar to Heidenheim 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.960
 also there 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.670
 this mental combat and this 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 be moved 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.390
 do you have this week or do you 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.040
 This week was different than behaving 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.780
 So then you have the optimism 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.180
 can pull out that this time the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.900
 training performance maybe already on 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.880
 play transfer 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.460
 you are because of course you are also with 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.610
 the guys are constantly in a dialogue where 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.120
 You also appeals also clearly things 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.650
 clearly aware of the situation makes 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.000
 because i do not know or 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:28.150
 sometimes you thought in the past 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.320
 that's the look on the table for 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.320
 the 100 revolting 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.930
 but we can do one again 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.930
 give answer to 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.370
 You will now be the team 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:04.900
 rather defensive align more compact in 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.900
 the key is the problem 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.880
 I got it yes I have it this week 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.230
 you should never have heard of it 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.240
 So we play defensively when we are 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.770
 when we look at 80 percent of ours 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.370
 Viewing Goals and has nothing 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.050
 to do with whether we go into the game with 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.610
 have played a rhombus with us 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.440
 one with a broad midfield 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.160
 have played though with one or two 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.620
 have played spikes but there went 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.260
 it's about moments where we glare where we are 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.880
 have made individual mistakes and 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.490
 he has less to do with it then 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.870
 whether you are with a defensive one 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:47.390
 Mittelfeld played offensively 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:48.560
 Aligned midfield only sometimes 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.980
 in the impression that maybe the 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.470
 Team the easier football 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.700
 Somehow where I'm not so tactical 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.770
 Maybe he has to think 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.140
 but simplicity 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.370
 we can really do it now 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.560
 discuss a few gates again 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.150
 as it is sometimes simply a 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.570
 clear play it was not one 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.840
 System question not because we are in 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.110
 one 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.940
 we can talk about a system now 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.169
 against Heidenheim and a week 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.880
 before that we have in the same system 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.210
 Won 3 0 against Fortuna Dusseldorf 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.919
 So I guess that's it for 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:31.250
 simple but it is about a clarity 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:33.140
 in the game also on our defeat 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:37.130
 against karlsruhe was not a problem of 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:40.280
 systems i think because this system has 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.780
 led to that the ksc up to this 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.460
 double beat out of the game 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.460
 really had no chance 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.520
 then we say at this point now 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.559
 thanks for coming wishes good 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.180
 then enjoy a pleasant holiday 

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:03.529
 will remember sunday on time 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.529
 come to the stadium thank you
