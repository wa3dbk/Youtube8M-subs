00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
that would be a bit short since I don't

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.230 
that would be a bit short since I don't
really<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.080> all<00:00:19.640> too<00:00:20.640> much<00:00:20.820> bird<00:00:21.029> supplies

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
mine is a 19 x 14 x 31 Tom and then

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
mine is a 19 x 14 x 31 Tom and then
based<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.430> size<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> figure<00:01:15.479> out

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
based on that size you can figure out

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.830 
based on that size you can figure out
how<00:01:15.930> large<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.590> care<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:16.979> need<00:01:17.220> for

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
or something like that so that's the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840 
or something like that so that's the
cage<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> second<00:01:25.799> day<00:01:25.920> purchase

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
