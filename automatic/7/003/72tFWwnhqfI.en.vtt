like people are gonna take their kids to
see<00:05:39.570> it<00:05:39.600> well<00:05:39.930> think<00:05:40.080> about<00:05:40.170> how<00:05:40.440> well<00:05:40.650> the

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
see it well think about how well the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.100 
see it well think about how well the
Dark<00:05:41.010> Knight<00:05:41.250> did<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:42.150> was<00:05:42.330> pretty<00:05:42.600> dark<00:05:42.960> and

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
Dark Knight did that was pretty dark and

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.600 
Dark Knight did that was pretty dark and
yet<00:05:43.290> people<00:05:43.440> want<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.740> see<00:05:43.890> that<00:05:44.070> over<00:05:44.310> and

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
yet people want to see that over and

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.130 
yet people want to see that over and
over<00:05:44.820> again<00:05:44.910> and<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.270> think<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.570> exact<00:05:45.930> same

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
over again and I think the exact same

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.990 
over again and I think the exact same
thing<00:05:46.410> is<00:05:46.560> going<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.860> happen<00:05:47.250> with<00:05:47.430> both<00:05:47.640> real

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
thing is going to happen with both real

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.060 
thing is going to happen with both real
at<00:05:48.450> least<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.780> hope<00:05:48.960> that<00:05:49.170> Hugh<00:05:49.380> Jackman<00:05:49.860> lives

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
at least I hope that Hugh Jackman lives

at least I hope that Hugh Jackman lives
