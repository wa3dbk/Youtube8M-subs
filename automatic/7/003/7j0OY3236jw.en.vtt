 Welcome to the story online, this story is sponsored by the Screen Actors Association Foundation. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.429
 I am Betty White, I think we will have a happy time today. 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.090
 At least, I think I will. Ok, let me read a book for you. 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.240
 I like animals, all animals, but dogs are especially my favorite. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 So today, the story I am telling you is about a dirty dog ​​named Harry. 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.009
 It was written by Gini-Zion, Margaret-Blauai-Graham. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.320
 Harry was a white dog with a black dot. He likes everything, but he doesn't like bathing. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.640
 So, one day, when he heard the water inside the bathtub was flowing. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:54.590
 He took the brush that was brushed...and buried it in the backyard. After that, he ran away from the house. 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.190
 He played in the repairing street and made his body dirty. 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.420
 He ran to the railroad and played more dirty. 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.960
 He played hide-and-seek with other dogs and became very dirty. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.290
 He slipped down from the coal pipe and was dirty and unrecognizable. 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:30.090
 In fact, he changed from a white ditch with black spots to a black dog with white spots. 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:40.030
 Although there are many other things that can be done, Harry is wondering if his family thinks he really left home. 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.870
 He is very tired and very hungry. 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.540
 He started to go home in non-stop. 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.750
 When Harry walked to his house, he climbed over the fence and sat there looking at the back door. 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.680
 One family member looked outside and said, "There is a strange dog in the backyard." 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.310
 By the way, who saw Harry? 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.180
 When Harry heard this, he tried to show that he was Harry. 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.680
 He began to do all sorts of previous clever tricks. He turned his body over and turned over. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.709
 He rolled around on the ground and then pretended to die. He danced and sang a song. 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.749
 He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook his head and said: 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:40.409
 "Oh no, it can't be Harry." 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:47.079
 Harry gave up and he slowly walked to the door, but suddenly he stopped. 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.909
 He ran to the corner of the garden and began to dig down. 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.889
 Not that he jumped away from the small pit, issued a short cry, happy shouting. 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.619
 He found the brush to brush! He used his mouth to pick up the brush. 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:08.539
 He ran into the house and stumbled up the stairs, and everyone was following him tightly. 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:14.749
 He jumped into the tub, sat there, pleading with a brush in his mouth. 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.279
 A trick that he had never played before. 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.700
 "The puppy wants to take a shower," the little girl yelled. 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.619
 Her father said, 'Why don’t you give him a shower?' 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.769
 Harry washed a most lubricious shower, never before. Just like a magic. 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:44.759
 When they first groomed him, they shouted loudly. 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.959
 "Dad! Mom! Come see! It's Harry! It's Harry!" they shouted. 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:55.309
 Harry shook his tail and was very, very happy. His family caressed and helped him wash. 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:04:03.419
 He became a white dog with black spots. 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.029
 It feels great to go home. 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.339
 After dinner, Harry slept in his favorite place. 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.299
 He is happy to have a sweet dream, dreaming how fun it is after getting dirty. 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:29.250
 He slept so fragrantly that he didn't even feel the scrub brush hidden under his pillow. 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.789
 Do you like this cute dog? You will like this dog more. 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:40.270
 This is my good friend Yunge. I just met him. He is a puppy in a shelter. 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.110
 He found a home that was always very happy, and it was a happy ending. 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.069
 Just like Harry is a dirty dog, there is a perfect result. Thank you!
