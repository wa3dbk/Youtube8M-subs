in the tsunami and yeah an evacuation is

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.050 
in the tsunami and yeah an evacuation is
putting<00:01:54.349> even<00:01:54.469> more<00:01:54.619> pressure<00:01:55.009> on<00:01:55.279> people<00:01:55.759> who

radiation<00:02:05.149> levels<00:02:05.509> are<00:02:05.689> not<00:02:06.349> that<00:02:06.590> high

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
radiation levels are not that high

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.020 
radiation levels are not that high
they're<00:02:07.890> far<00:02:08.160> higher<00:02:08.399> than<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.759> should<00:02:08.789> be

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
they're far higher than they should be

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
they're far higher than they should be
and<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.720> certainly<00:02:09.959> agree<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.770> James<00:02:11.130> Agatha

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and I certainly agree with James Agatha

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.290 
and I certainly agree with James Agatha
this<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.860> tragic<00:02:14.090> situation<00:02:15.090> that's

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
this is a tragic situation that's

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360 
this is a tragic situation that's
unfolding<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:16.650> you're<00:02:16.770> not<00:02:16.920> talking

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
unfolding here but you're not talking

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.010 
unfolding here but you're not talking
about<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.760> kind<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.060> radiation<00:02:18.330> levels<00:02:18.930> were

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
about the kind of radiation levels were

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.750 
about the kind of radiation levels were
you<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> tell<00:02:19.470> everybody<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.069> rock

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
you going to tell everybody to go rock

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
you going to tell everybody to go rock
pills<00:02:21.300> because<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.650> not<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.890> dangerous

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
pills because it's not that dangerous

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
pills because it's not that dangerous
when<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.940> gets<00:02:24.120> dispersed<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.720> far<00:02:24.959> away<00:02:25.230> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
when it gets dispersed that far away and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.250 
when it gets dispersed that far away and
you<00:02:26.220> create<00:02:26.550> panic<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.239> create<00:02:27.600> enormous

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you create panic and you create enormous

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.500 
you create panic and you create enormous
logistical<00:02:28.770> problems<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.940> an<00:02:30.060> area<00:02:30.239> that's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
logistical problems in an area that's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.979 
logistical problems in an area that's
already<00:02:30.900> suffering<00:02:31.830> almost<00:02:32.190> beyond<00:02:32.730> belief

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
already suffering almost beyond belief

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.070 
already suffering almost beyond belief
so<00:02:33.989> how<00:02:34.410> significant<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.060> bob<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:36.959> is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
so how significant is this bob what is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.970 
so how significant is this bob what is
unfolded<00:02:37.739> tonight<00:02:38.390> another<00:02:39.390> explosion

a crisis you have to remember that we

the Gulf oil spill and how much damage

the Gulf oil spill and how much damage
that<00:03:15.720> was<00:03:15.870> doing<00:03:16.230> think<00:03:16.739> about<00:03:16.769> how<00:03:17.100> many

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that was doing think about how many

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.270 
that was doing think about how many
people<00:03:17.730> died<00:03:17.970> mining<00:03:18.900> coal<00:03:19.170> every<00:03:19.500> year<00:03:19.709> we

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
people died mining coal every year we

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.490 
people died mining coal every year we
long<00:03:21.239> as<00:03:21.420> we're<00:03:21.570> looking<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.019> energy<00:03:22.380> we're

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
long as we're looking for energy we're

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
long as we're looking for energy we're
going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.950> take<00:03:23.160> some<00:03:23.310> risks<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
going to have to take some risks and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.870 
going to have to take some risks and
this<00:03:24.110> what<00:03:25.110> we're<00:03:25.290> seeing<00:03:25.470> now<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.860> very<00:03:26.340> very

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
this what we're seeing now is very very

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.569 
this what we're seeing now is very very
bad<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.510> very<00:03:27.570> frightening<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.860> me<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.310> in

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
bad and very frightening to me and in

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.150 
bad and very frightening to me and in
many<00:03:29.790> ways<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:31.320> argument<00:03:31.530> about<00:03:31.950> whether

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
many ways but the argument about whether

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.400 
many ways but the argument about whether
we<00:03:32.280> should<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.700> nuclear<00:03:33.510> power<00:03:33.780> or<00:03:34.049> not<00:03:34.200> is

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
we should have nuclear power or not is

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.310 
we should have nuclear power or not is
not<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.890> simple<00:03:35.209> based<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.600> one<00:03:36.840> accident

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
not so simple based on this one accident

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.229 
not so simple based on this one accident
or<00:03:37.470> any<00:03:37.620> other<00:03:37.829> accident<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.640> get<00:03:38.850> back<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
or any other accident but to get back to

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.300 
or any other accident but to get back to
the<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.959> question<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.650> an

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the the question this is an

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.490 
the the question this is an
unprecedented<00:03:42.200> situation<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:44.579> makes<00:03:45.470> one<00:03:46.470> of

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
unprecedented situation it makes one of

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.170 
unprecedented situation it makes one of
the<00:03:46.620> things<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:46.980> think<00:03:47.040> happens<00:03:47.670> here<00:03:48.000> is

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
the things that I think happens here is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.729 
the things that I think happens here is
that<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.780> system<00:03:49.170> because<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
that the system because of the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.920 
that the system because of the
earthquake<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.400> tsunami<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.970> there's<00:03:51.840> about

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
earthquake and tsunami and there's about

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.500 
earthquake and tsunami and there's about
ten<00:03:52.320> reactors<00:03:52.829> on<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.130> one<00:03:53.370> site<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
ten reactors on this one site and this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.530 
ten reactors on this one site and this
fire<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> reactor<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.880> distractive

fire in the reactor that is distractive

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.160 
fire in the reactor that is distractive
