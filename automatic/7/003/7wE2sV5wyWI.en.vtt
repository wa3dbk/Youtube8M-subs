Hello, everybody. This is Kirill "ANGE1" Karasev, HellRaisers' captain. I present you a little vlog with my conclusions about the second playing day.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.940
We've just lost to Na'Vi in upper bracket. Very disappointing loss. In my opinion, we could have won.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:37.580
I suppose, lack of preparation made a difference. Ever since Sasha s1mple came to our team, we've been looking for our game. 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.580
We try to mix aggressive gaming and slow rounds. Frankly speaking, we still have no trained tactics, so we just rely on our skills. 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:59.720
We played well for attack. Took inportant pistol rounds. But I feel sorry for the defence on de_inferno. We failed to win pistols. It could have been deciding in that battle. 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.500
But, looking at our preparation at the moment, I guess, we performed decently, though we could have been much better. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:20.740
Tomorrow, after we discuss all the mistakes and successful moves as well as after watching Virtus.Pro's opponent demos, we will try to walk and have a revenge over Na'Vi.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.320
We want to rehabilitate ourselves in your eyes. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.140
We were pleased by viewers' suppot at Igromir. Spectators divided into two halfs - one was cheering for us and another - for Na'Vi. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.740
Thanks everuone for your support! Everyone, who came here and who watched our games online. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.500
Thanks ASUS for supporting us for a long time.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.860
That's all for today. See you tomorrow! We'll try to start go–æd and finish even better. Bye!
