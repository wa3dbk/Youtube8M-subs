00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
the operator arm that way I can't come

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.650 
the operator arm that way I can't come

off of the new lid you want to make sure

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.960 
off of the new lid you want to make sure
that<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.929> concave<00:01:48.410> side<00:01:48.679> of<00:01:48.709> the<00:01:48.979> clip<00:01:49.220> bears

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
that the concave side of the clip bears

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.180 
that the concave side of the clip bears
against<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.509> dome<00:01:50.690> bar<00:01:50.959> if<00:01:51.200> you've<00:01:51.890> attached

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
against the dome bar if you've attached

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.710 
against the dome bar if you've attached
the<00:01:52.340> handle<00:01:52.610> temporarily<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.360> will<00:01:53.509> need<00:01:53.629> to

the handle temporarily you will need to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.389 
the handle temporarily you will need to
unscrew<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:54.619> can<00:01:54.739> put<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.979> screen<00:01:55.190> back

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
unscrew it so we can put the screen back

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:08.350 
unscrew it so we can put the screen back
up<00:01:55.610> into<00:01:55.759> place

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360

once the screens back up into place we

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.200 
once the screens back up into place we
can<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.070> ahead<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.280> put<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.550> handle<00:02:11.850> back<00:02:11.880> on
