00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
they're limited on how many they're

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.639 
they're limited on how many they're
given<00:01:46.259> probably<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.430> whatever<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.649> it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
given probably you know whatever so it's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.530 
given probably you know whatever so it's
why<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> want<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.640> friendly<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> your

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
why you want to be friendly to your

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.280 
why you want to be friendly to your
cashiers<00:01:53.030> anyways<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.240> used<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.780> thirty

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
cashiers anyways I used to thirty

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.539 
cashiers anyways I used to thirty
percent<00:01:55.649> off<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.130> three<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> my

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
percent off on all three of my

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.520 
percent off on all three of my
transactions<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> basically<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
transactions here and so basically the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.480 
transactions here and so basically the
way<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.829> works<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:04.040> thirty<00:02:05.040> percent

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
way it works it's like if thirty percent

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.130 
way it works it's like if thirty percent
off<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> better<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> sale<00:02:06.659> price<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
off is better than the sale price you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
off is better than the sale price you
