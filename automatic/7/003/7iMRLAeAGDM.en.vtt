 before once again saw 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.559
 the miniatures the pieces that we have but the goal 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.499

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.539

 - we have the maestro that the hulk and moutinho 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 I really liked the surprise the details 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.429
 in savings 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
 While I think I really like it here. 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.230
 nothing however that is 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 for its part, stressed that the other 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 a database 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 passed the title 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.290
 It is also little 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.080
 We already have to fine here.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.380
 options 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 it should be noted that the communiquÃ© 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 I was afraid 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 When we saw better photos I cheered. 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 o basel for 3 sets to 0 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 The detail that I said about peace reminds us 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 the parts are sold separately 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.640

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.610

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.299

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.649
 where you 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.159
 the base 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.159
 What scene does this scene appear on

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:30.689
 would have pleased 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.839
 Trojan Greeks
