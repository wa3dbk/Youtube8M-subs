 no this workshop we go now 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.910
 try to work on the small 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.430
 original frame model that will us 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.500
 allow to realize this model then I 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 choose two plants and there we 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 work with deposit of 5 enemies a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 junkie water and chlorophytum in skin 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.080
 five and a half I will remove the flavors 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.059
 to discover the products we 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.690
 have on the inside to create our 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.910
 vegetable frame 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.720
 here we had for example a package 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720
 sweet flavors 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.500
 this is our aluminum son 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.809
 fibers and girls and sisal fiber and our 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.820
 buy potting soil and our bag of 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.050
 ball of expanded clay this is the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.120
 procedure is identical 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.190
 we will first put a bed of 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.050
 expanded clay beads for the drain 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.050
 when watering our frame 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.260
 here and we install our plants 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:52.990
 here I am finishing an assembly with 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:54.670
 monteiro here are our plants are 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.470
 now installed to guarantee the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.270
 freshness I will add some balls 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:18.340
 of expanded clay at the base of my 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:20.320
 plants our plants are now 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.810
 installed we spent the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.269
 decoration of our card 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.410
 so I'm going to work with fiber 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:34.660
 zephyr that I'm going to roll 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:40.170
 like these cut a small piece of 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.170
 aluminum wire that I pass through 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 and we are going to create a fair grid 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.220
 in front of fibrosis and fear 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.299
 it's like those between your fingers 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.050
 and I install by planting in the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.050
 mold 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.560
 at mont ventoux 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.459
 here we go now work 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.560
 the sisal fiber and make small 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:45.250
 balls passing the fiber between our 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:45.250
 hands I will therefore prepared three balls 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:10.079
 and I install my balls with my 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:13.159
 aluminum wires like this I go to 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:18.919
 middle of my ball and I'm spinning around 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.919
 a trick I install 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 finally 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.480
 -the third bull in the same way 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480
 or 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:57.639
 and I come installed them along my 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:05:00.400
 frame this is our plant frame is 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.650
 now finished admit to play a little 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.780
 of patience a little creativity and the 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.240
 pleasure to reuse the elements 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.060
 hidden in our gourmet parcel to very 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.500
