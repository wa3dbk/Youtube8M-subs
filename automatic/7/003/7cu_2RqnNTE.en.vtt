00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.600
 in frequency what we know 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.359
 as a lens without insurance 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.280
 In principle what we prepare is the 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.469
 skin of the patient 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.400
 let's work what is all the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:49.880
 front face ovules 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.760
 also what he invented put ten things 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.760
 let's proceed to choose 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.830
 [Music] 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.610
 and they do not exist 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.190
 Of course you will take into account 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.190
 the type of skin 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.850
 total 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.549
 to choose in the product 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.550
 This product has a neutral pH with 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.659
 which I can also work 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.520
 the area but the vehicular 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.299
 but do not go back jericho 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.780
 we remove put leaves in drinks in 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.780
 waters 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.120
 of return 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.810
 we repeat the operation 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.600
 and we are going to 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.420
 [Music] 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.930
 with in the area but a little bit of what 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 we are 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.880
 barboncitos with a congestive lesion 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.550
 to work 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.470
 yes because it's the only area where my 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.440
 machine head can not be passed 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.970
 that they used as a vehicle we use a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.610
 general then we proceed to apply a 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.670
 gene in the area that we are going to treat 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.489
 we first work in front 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:10.069
 we already have we are going to work in the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.069
 intensity needed by patient 2a 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.460
 so this is what we call 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.330
 demonstrate what we apply 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.250
 In circular form 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.270
 Sun 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.550
 so that this treatment 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.540
 fundamentally what you do 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:37.040
 activate collagen and elastin and this 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.550
 it translates into drawing everything they are 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.270
 wrinkles and minimize what are lines of 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.920
 expression 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.390
 [Music] 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.200
 result looks 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.860
 the first session 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.490
 [Music] 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.480
 what enthuses most sebastiÃ¡n 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.480
 as it is said 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.680
 determined from the neck area 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.040
 specifically work the neck all 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.010
 what I know is cut and everything that the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.790
 face we remove the remainder of the rest 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.420
 is a neutral gender that we can use 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.430
 also with some principle 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.980
 such as the image that is in sun 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.050
 [Music] 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.360
 excellent for this stretch 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.159
 we remove the surplus because what 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.159
 let's do now is to apply 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.249
 As you can see, there is no environment 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.989
 knee temperature frequency 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:50.789
 there is no kind of relationship and we can 

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:52.660
 apply a mask directly 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.529
 lift 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.509
 let's do now 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.639
 so that the patient is zelaya and 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.129
 defeated 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.439
 and go mentally fortified 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.069
 how much of that is a criterion 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.520
 professional and the duration is about 45 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.520
 minutes 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.680
 [Music] 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:18.610
 we think that this mask has several 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.610
 active ingredients 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.810
 also in all the areas that we have 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.240
 worked up 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.389
 [Applause] 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.870
 It is recommended to do every 20 days to 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.430
 let this act is that it occurs 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.330
 Really 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.580
 the renovation 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.909
 or rather an activation of 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.909
 Collagen 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.059
 how will you see the lines of expression 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.059
 [Music] 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.260
 and it's very generous because it allows us 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.440
 always work 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.440
 [Applause] 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.589
 ricote 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:19.630
 it is never a periocular area only 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.840
 we complemented the session with the monk 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.840
 contour of the 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:38.919
 and then what we do is withdraw 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.919
 anyone
