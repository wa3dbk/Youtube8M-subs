we have a lot of memories to make with
that<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:24.210> think<00:00:24.900> more<00:00:25.050> than<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.710> records<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that I think more than the records and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
that I think more than the records and
you<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.269> hopefully<00:00:27.420> tomorrow<00:00:27.900> national

you know hopefully tomorrow national
championship<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.980> think<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> relationships

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
championship I think the relationships

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
championship I think the relationships
we've<00:00:30.510> been<00:00:30.750> able<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.250> each

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
we've been able to to have with each

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.280 
we've been able to to have with each
other<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.910> mean<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.840> found<00:00:34.020> here

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
