recording anything otherwise it would

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.090 
recording anything otherwise it would

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
going to delete that real quick so yeah

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
going to delete that real quick so yeah
it<00:01:13.799> had<00:01:13.920> me<00:01:14.010> stumped<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.490> while<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it had me stumped for a while I was I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390 
it had me stumped for a while I was I
was<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.080> record<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.770> voice<00:01:17.009> using

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
was going to just record my voice using

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.330 
was going to just record my voice using
Pro<00:01:17.939> Tools<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.619> save<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.009> switch<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Pro Tools and then save it and switch it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
Pro Tools and then save it and switch it
over<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> broadband<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.540> figured<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> have

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
over to broadband but I figured I have

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
over to broadband but I figured I have
to<00:01:23.009> figure<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.580> use<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.820> anyway<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to figure out how to use it anyway so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.679 
to figure out how to use it anyway so
what<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.450> went<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> spotlight

Changes of nothing like that uh then my

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.539 
Changes of nothing like that uh then my
favourite<00:02:57.359> many<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.819> figured<00:02:59.819> maybe<00:03:01.549> maybe

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
favourite many I figured maybe maybe

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.670 
favourite many I figured maybe maybe
that<00:03:02.760> would<00:03:02.879> help<00:03:03.120> me<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.510> record<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.319> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
that would help me to record but it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.660 
that would help me to record but it
still<00:03:04.889> didn't<00:03:05.099> work<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.319> then<00:03:07.370> another<00:03:08.370> thing

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
still didn't work so then another thing

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.789 
still didn't work so then another thing

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
note that I was noticing was down here

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.800 
note that I was noticing was down here
you<00:03:10.950> got<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.400> only<00:03:11.519> have<00:03:11.700> two<00:03:11.909> buttons<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
you got you only have two buttons and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.330 
you got you only have two buttons and
when<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.989> would<00:03:13.230> was<00:03:13.799> looking<00:03:14.069> for<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
when I would was looking for the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.330 
when I would was looking for the
solution<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> use<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> microphone<00:03:15.889> every<00:03:16.889> video

tutorial<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.629> saw<00:03:19.160> had<00:03:20.160> more<00:03:20.879> than<00:03:21.000> two

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
tutorial that I saw had more than two

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.780 
tutorial that I saw had more than two
buttons<00:03:21.599> on<00:03:21.810> each<00:03:22.169> track<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.430> I'm<00:03:23.489> thinking

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
buttons on each track so I'm thinking

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.879 
buttons on each track so I'm thinking
like<00:03:23.849> what<00:03:24.030> what's<00:03:24.419> going<00:03:24.629> on<00:03:24.870> why's<00:03:25.410> mommy<00:03:25.709> we

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
like what what's going on why's mommy we

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.920 
like what what's going on why's mommy we
got<00:03:25.919> two<00:03:26.160> buttons<00:03:26.519> maybe<00:03:26.699> that's<00:03:26.940> why<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.389> can't

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
got two buttons maybe that's why I can't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960 
got two buttons maybe that's why I can't
record<00:03:28.049> because<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.579> buttons<00:03:29.760> on<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
record because one of the buttons on the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.780 
record because one of the buttons on the
track<00:03:30.209> was<00:03:30.419> a<00:03:30.629> red<00:03:31.049> circle<00:03:31.440> which<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.859> pretty

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
track was a red circle which is pretty

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.539 
track was a red circle which is pretty
universal<00:03:33.329> as<00:03:33.419> a<00:03:33.540> record<00:03:33.870> button<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.340> see

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
universal as a record button as you see

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.140 
universal as a record button as you see
down<00:03:35.669> here<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:38.659> so<00:03:39.659> uh<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:41.519> only<00:03:41.790> two<00:03:41.879> buttons

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
down here so so uh the only two buttons

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.479 
down here so so uh the only two buttons
you<00:03:42.209> have<00:03:42.239> here<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.840> headphones<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
you have here is the headphones and a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.460 
you have here is the headphones and a
speaker<00:03:44.940> what<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.419> want<00:03:45.629> go<00:03:46.049> through<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.319> which

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
speaker what I want go through it which

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.920 
speaker what I want go through it which
I'm<00:03:46.590> guessing<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:47.150> mute<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.299> track<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.840> then

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
I'm guessing is mute to track and then

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.920 
I'm guessing is mute to track and then
headphones<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.560> properly<00:03:49.829> solo<00:03:50.069> track<00:03:50.599> so<00:03:51.599> I

went up to track and as you see at first

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.430 
went up to track and as you see at first
we<00:03:55.560> got<00:03:56.389> at<00:03:57.389> first<00:03:57.449> you<00:03:57.750> got<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> show

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
we got at first you got a show

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
then came down to enable multi track

the<00:04:07.889> recording<00:04:08.310> track<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.940> recording<00:04:09.299> button

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
the recording track the recording button

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.649 
the recording track the recording button
pops<00:04:09.720> up<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:12.060> there<00:04:12.209> were<00:04:12.269> still<00:04:12.479> more

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
pops up but there were still more

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.629 
pops up but there were still more
buttons<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.590> figured<00:04:13.949> I'll<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.370> keep

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
buttons so I figured I'll just keep

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:21.699 
buttons so I figured I'll just keep
going<00:04:14.870> track<00:04:15.870> unlock<00:04:18.560> shall<00:04:19.560> monitoring

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
going track unlock shall monitoring

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.360 
going track unlock shall monitoring
so<00:04:21.889> then<00:04:22.090> that<00:04:23.620> still<00:04:24.620> didn't<00:04:24.830> work<00:04:24.979> when<00:04:25.310> I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
so then that still didn't work when I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.610 
so then that still didn't work when I
would<00:04:25.520> click<00:04:25.669> on<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.910> record<00:04:26.240> thing

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
would click on the record thing

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.680 
would click on the record thing
somewhere<00:04:27.620> man<00:04:27.800> what<00:04:28.039> is<00:04:28.130> really<00:04:28.340> going<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:28.690> so

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
somewhere man what is really going on so

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.749 
somewhere man what is really going on so
I<00:04:29.720> figured<00:04:30.310> let's<00:04:31.310> check<00:04:31.490> out<00:04:31.610> the

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
I figured let's check out the

thousand percent sure that it's

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.820 
thousand percent sure that it's
recording<00:06:47.980> your<00:06:48.970> voice<00:06:49.500> yeah<00:06:50.500> that's<00:06:50.710> pretty

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
recording your voice yeah that's pretty

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.490 
recording your voice yeah that's pretty
much<00:06:50.920> the<00:06:51.160> video<00:06:51.900> like<00:06:52.900> I<00:06:52.990> said<00:06:53.170> it's<00:06:53.320> probably

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
much the video like I said it's probably

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.810 
much the video like I said it's probably
not<00:06:53.770> a<00:06:53.830> big<00:06:54.040> deal<00:06:54.190> to<00:06:54.340> other<00:06:54.430> people<00:06:54.760> they

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
not a big deal to other people they

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.180 
not a big deal to other people they
probably<00:06:54.970> knew<00:06:55.240> what<00:06:55.360> to<00:06:55.450> do<00:06:55.600> from<00:06:56.470> the<00:06:56.590> get-go

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
probably knew what to do from the get-go

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.430 
probably knew what to do from the get-go

stuff but uh hopefully this video helped
somebody<00:07:11.680> out<00:07:11.890> because<00:07:12.430> I<00:07:12.810> was<00:07:13.810> looking<00:07:14.080> for

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
somebody out because I was looking for

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.220 
somebody out because I was looking for
on<00:07:14.230> YouTube<00:07:14.550> Google<00:07:15.550> I<00:07:15.880> think<00:07:16.660> about<00:07:16.810> anything

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
on YouTube Google I think about anything

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.840 
on YouTube Google I think about anything
I<00:07:17.380> found<00:07:18.750> something<00:07:19.750> about<00:07:19.840> sound<00:07:20.710> using<00:07:21.190> the

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850 
I found something about sound using the

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.360 
I found something about sound using the
built-in<00:07:22.120> mic<00:07:22.300> for<00:07:22.540> Sam<00:07:22.750> one<00:07:23.020> but<00:07:23.340> yeah<00:07:24.340> I

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
built-in mic for Sam one but yeah I

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.250 
built-in mic for Sam one but yeah I
didn't<00:07:24.670> see<00:07:24.730> anything<00:07:24.910> for<00:07:25.210> GarageBand<00:07:25.840> so<00:07:26.020> I

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260 
didn't see anything for GarageBand so I

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.650 
didn't see anything for GarageBand so I
figured<00:07:27.130> I'd<00:07:27.190> just<00:07:27.220> make<00:07:27.490> this<00:07:27.610> video<00:07:27.940> classic

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:28.660 
figured I'd just make this video classic

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.060 
figured I'd just make this video classic
and<00:07:28.810> probably<00:07:29.140> I<00:07:29.170> probably<00:07:29.500> use<00:07:29.710> it<00:07:29.860> on<00:07:29.980> the

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
and probably I probably use it on the

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.730 
and probably I probably use it on the
discussion<00:07:30.820> board<00:07:31.060> for<00:07:31.120> my<00:07:31.360> school<00:07:31.650> so<00:07:32.650> I'll
