what<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:00.930> discovered<00:00:01.439> it<00:00:01.530> actually<00:00:02.070> that

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
what we discovered it actually that

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.240 
what we discovered it actually that
reliable<00:00:03.510> communication<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.319> not<00:00:04.560> all<00:00:04.830> about

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
reliable communication is not all about

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.700 
reliable communication is not all about
making<00:00:05.819> reliable<00:00:06.480> communication<00:00:07.049> paths<00:00:07.319> but

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
making reliable communication paths but

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.310 
making reliable communication paths but
also<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.820> actually<00:00:09.360> communicate<00:00:09.570> everything

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
also to actually communicate everything

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.580 
also to actually communicate everything
reliable<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:12.059> prepared<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> small<00:00:13.170> video

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
reliable and I prepared a small video

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.870 
reliable and I prepared a small video
I'm<00:00:14.460> going<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> show<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:16.550> what<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.850> see

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I'm going to show and what you can see

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
I'm going to show and what you can see
in<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.750> movie<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.289> actually<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.920> place

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
in this movie is actually that we place

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:31.780 
in this movie is actually that we place
to<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.180> regular<00:00:21.930> beacons<00:00:22.289> writing<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> sorry

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.750 

okay<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.420> set<00:00:33.660> over<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.050> again<00:00:34.760> what

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
okay I'm all set over here again what

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
okay I'm all set over here again what
you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.600> movie<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.110> basically<00:00:37.680> we

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you can see in the movie is basically we

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
you can see in the movie is basically we
have<00:00:37.920> place<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.610> meet<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.910> notes<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.329> each

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
have place to meet you notes on each

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.110 
have place to meet you notes on each
side<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> door<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.520> guy<00:00:41.670> hooping

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
side of the door and the guy hooping

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
side of the door and the guy hooping
around<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.809> reflected<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
around is reflected actually in the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.930 
around is reflected actually in the
highlands<00:00:45.149> next<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> screen<00:00:47.550> left

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

corner<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:49.530> he<00:00:49.680> moves<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.579> can

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
corner and as he moves you actually can

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
corner and as he moves you actually can
see<00:00:53.000> again<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> sorry<00:00:58.699> yeah<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.449> like

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
see again so sorry yeah I think I like
