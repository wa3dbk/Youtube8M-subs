 they carry the story of olga frías 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.720
 for me 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.150
 on September 21 the community 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.610
 mexicana in taiwan and other guests 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.979
 Latin Americans and Asians dined on 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.140
 Yucatan or rather in the corner 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.119
 yucateco the one that the chef smells cold 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.250
 camera I convert the living room of the world 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.780
 Taipei trade center where it was made 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.509
 a party at the invitation of the government 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.460
 from mexico the experiences of this trip 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.750
 he tells them megamedia tv 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.610
 look at me pleasantly surprised that 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.810
 they were delighted 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.810
 They were very 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.930
 surprised that things are done 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.620
 roasted 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.450
 they are not used to burning and doing 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.220
 all this that we used 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.260
 especially to Yucatecan cuisine that a 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.530
 of its characteristics is the taste 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.950
 smoke they are not used to this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.840
 type of flavors and textures or 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.460
 techniques in the kitchen 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.109
 so yes it cost me a little bit of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.539
 I worked because I taught them how 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.840
 they had to do and when they returned 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.050
 all right 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 supposedly to simplify they had 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.400
 put things in the oven 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.280
 so there it is , I do not want it that way 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.780
 to do it again and once it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.780
 they saw the why 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.780
 they were all on skewers 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.460
 Korean will make coal in the direct 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 to the fire 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.790
 to do it so that the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.480
 more similar to the flavors of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.580
 Yucatan 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.430
 there was lime soup his car bicha and 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.680
 cochinita the myths of civil valladolid 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.019
 pac and guava paste with ball cheese 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.480
 that were prepared by cooks 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.190
 Asians to whom olga explained just 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.720
 two days before the process 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.140
 elaboration 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.380
 good one some of the ingredients 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.290
 as the files for example 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.160
 the habanero chile is like that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.010
 you can notice the chili to you if there was and with 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.260
 a very very similar flavor 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.680
 but chile habanero not gracefully 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 I sent in the suitcase that was sent 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.629
 Habanero peppers preserved but good 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.920
 finally habanero chiles and sauces 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.920
 press and that kind of thing 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.250
 a huge challenge was 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.690
 no longer talking about Yucatecan cuisine but 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.690
 to cook with them 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.950
 they only speak Chinese 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.690
 then it was a joke because I had to 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.660
 have a person translating 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.120
 and it was very funny to me that I 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.570
 spent half an hour or an hour giving a 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.660
 explanation and they with two squiggles a 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.280
 insurance may be possible that the wear 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.630
 half an hour talking and these gentlemen with 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.300
 two scribbles already have all the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.940
 explanation of what I said yes yes 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.400
 on the day when it was their turn 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.400
 prepare the dish they made it perfect 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
 Y 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.479
 the Taiwanese cuisine has left you some 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.479
 lesson 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.890
 I think that respect for their 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.890
 ingredients and for their products 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:41.020
 the order in which the speed works 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.020
 to which they work 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.790
 Y 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.750
 the camaraderie bed 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.540
 all the time they are helping each other though 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.320
 everyone has a mission very 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.800
 specific if one ends he throws the 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.310
 hand to the other and to the other and to the other and do 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.010
 a team that works very well as 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.320
 we were all great are all 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.949
 working at par and everyone helping each other 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.949
 one another 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.580
 what did you think you know more stories of 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.830
