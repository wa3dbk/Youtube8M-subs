00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.969
 when humidity affects the health of 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.520
 the walls and ceilings the symptoms 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.320
 are evident halo stains 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.750
 peeling in the paint and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.900
 discoloration are some signs of the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.210
 deterioration caused by environments 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.190
 to combat residual moisture venier 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.740
 proposes two solutions came 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.290
 traditional moisture coating and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.540
 came waterproofing before moisture 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.200
 two presentations allow use for 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.090
 Interior and exterior coating 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.860
 before moisture venier is recommended for 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.680
 surfaces that require a strong 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.250
 Anchoring its rough finish facilitates 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 adhesion of future coatings by 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.059
 Moreover in cases where 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.890
 present mild dampness 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.870
 the waterproofing is recommended 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.070
 Venier moisture that will give a smooth finish 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.070
 after its application 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.240
 before applying the product should be 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.830
 eliminate all the deteriorated surface 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.869
 once the surface is clean and 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.060
 free of dust we can already give the 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.979
 next step anti-humidity coating 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.440
 Venier must be applied with a brush 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.670
 hard pushing it against the wall and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.860
 turning it in circles 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 that way you get a perfect 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.509
 penetration of the product ensuring a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.320
 optimal anchor the estimated performance 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.450
 it is 500 grams per square meter 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.540
 after only 20 minutes you can already 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.659
 give the second coat with coating 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.549
 anti moisture come to the wall breathes what 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.189
 that allows residual moisture to be 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.750
 go evaporating gradually without damaging 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.790
 the covering that covers it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 later 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.370
 therefore in just two hours it is already 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 You can revoke painting or papering 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.240
 treated wall 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.680
 before moisture came came in three 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 presentations 15 and 25 kilos before 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.840
 humidity come the most effective remedy for 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.670
 finish with moisture stains 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.260
 Protect the health of your walls with 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 moisture protection coating
