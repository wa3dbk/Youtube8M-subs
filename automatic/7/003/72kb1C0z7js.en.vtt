um but I'm definitely here to help so um
let's<00:01:06.450> start<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> starting<00:01:07.770> price<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
let's start there the starting price is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.399 
let's start there the starting price is
$30<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.390> link<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.200> hair

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
$30 the link that I have in my hair

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.250 
$30 the link that I have in my hair
which<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.590> 18<00:01:11.070> inches<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> $100<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.960> still

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
which is 18 inches is $100 and I still

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140 
which is 18 inches is $100 and I still
think<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:14.159> price<00:01:14.549> budget

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
think that is a good price budget

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.940 
think that is a good price budget
because<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.830> do

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
because if you think about it if you do

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.240 
because if you think about it if you do
a<00:01:16.979> 14<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.640> 16<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.659> are<00:01:18.869> cheap<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
a 14 and 16 which are cheap which is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.670 
a 14 and 16 which are cheap which is
less<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> 18<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.259> include<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
less than the 18 but if you include that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
less than the 18 but if you include that
with<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> 18<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> still<00:01:23.909> come<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> good

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.310 
with the 18 and still come out to a good

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
I was in the pack but I guess since I
