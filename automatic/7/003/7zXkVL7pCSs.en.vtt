00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.099
 Today I just want to give you a new one 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.039
 or we can convey another idea 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.100
 a background or a one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 can make interesting viewing area 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 and I want that today 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 show dry brush technique times and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.340
 I'll tell you what you do 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.149
 So you need a choice of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.750
 colors of things you think they are good 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.230
 fit together and then he needs 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.579
 brush a wide flat brush and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 brushes brush you need some paper 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.039
 for fishing and water afterwards 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.379
 Of course, a palette on which he 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 colors then equal distributed I go 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 now bring me only once and then can 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.920
 we start immediately as well as on the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.410
 lavatory i have distributed i distributed 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 Hope completely recognize so partly under 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.780
 so still old plans here so that is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.869
 an appell yellow so very bright 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.210
 yellow, which we also mix with you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.380
 if you mix money with white 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.770
 that is a 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.180
 yellow green that is loud green and that is 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.920
 she nova red and I suppose that 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.289
 necessary equal a bit mission 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.329
 with the other colors 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.909
 We'll see, I'll start first 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.450
 with shades of green and there is dry 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.450
 presents award I'm going to brush 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.670
 still wet with it before 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.329
 Wash the color well 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:48.399
 I take a piece of the papers and 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:52.209
 through the brush then well to well so 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:57.700
 Now I just take a bit of 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:02:01.450
 this color on the broadsides and 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.899
 then paint the brush again 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.479
 paper and then importantly easy 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:14.010
 this dry color here the paper me 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:20.440
 to brush something off again 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:32.440
 and the dry couple color the paper 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:34.319
 feather now no water to distribute 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.040
 it can be a bit too easy 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.590
 make it more intense but there it is 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.450
 actually too intense so the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.090
 strokes should actually be running 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.730
 be broken 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.510
 I 'll just go to the second one 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.970
 green that too a bit on the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.540
 Paper from then you can already see 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.540
 a bit clearer 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.220
 so it goes on and on until I get the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.040
 necessary darkness and the necessary 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.799
 mix and you can do that easily now 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.959
 Trace a bit in time lapse 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.959
 the principle is already clear 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.720
 of course you can if you do that 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.400
 do not want to darken that too 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.920
 Paper white at some places 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.500
 let shine through 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.670
 then that leaves the background underneath 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.780
 the game is a bit brighter 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.480
 Of course you can join us for us 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.450
 dark has come even later times 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 with dry brush and a little lighter 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.630
 color or whitened with white color 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.860
 then the whole thing will go over it 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.269
 something brighter again so how would that be 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.200
 already liked it 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.880
 I'll just show you how 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.710
 Maybe it will be something again 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.980
 I can brighten up this bright one 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.990
 yellow otherwise I'll take it to the again 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.440
 cleaned brush the brush can do so 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.490
 also be cleaned in between times 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.410
 if he has mixed too much color 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.070
 then he is ripped off dry again 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.710
 and then comes the new color turn 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.950
 Now I'm going as well as again 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.840
 very bright colors and fields that 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.750
 just continue on and do the whole thing 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.790
 of course it will be on 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.780
 bit shifted into the pastel 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.430
 As I said, I would have actually now 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.410
 not made for the number 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.860
 Show that is now again 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.860
 brighter 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.300
 and also a bit unified 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.059
 Now I just want to go back 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.759
 a bit of the green with the 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:20.689
 the bright green after the bright one 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:23.569
 green with the yellow and the again to 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.369
 conclusion with his push on the 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:34.509
 Go green and look like this 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:39.939
 in all directions dishes background 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:42.919
 the lively and although then 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:46.269
 if necessary, continue to work 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:50.569
 that's actually the whole secret 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:52.309
 your dry brush technique yes me 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.069
 I wish you much fun that once 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:57.759
 try it out and see you in the 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.759
 next video
