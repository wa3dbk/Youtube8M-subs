today I kind of wanted to show you

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.369 
today I kind of wanted to show you
something<00:00:04.680> I've<00:00:04.770> been<00:00:04.799> working<00:00:05.220> on

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
something I've been working on

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.450 
something I've been working on
you<00:00:07.379> got<00:00:07.620> an<00:00:08.340> Arduino<00:00:08.849> Uno<00:00:09.980> you<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.130> see<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
you got an Arduino Uno you can see I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.709 
you got an Arduino Uno you can see I
have<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:12.290> hooked<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> pin<00:00:14.280> 13<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
have it hooked up to pin 13 in the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.890 
have it hooked up to pin 13 in the
ground<00:00:16.490> and<00:00:17.490> they<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.180> directly<00:00:18.600> hooked

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
ground and they have it directly hooked

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.529 
ground and they have it directly hooked
up<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.710> solid<00:00:20.039> state<00:00:20.340> relay<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:24.180> they've

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
up to this solid state relay and they've

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.700 
up to this solid state relay and they've
got<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.830> plugged<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:26.279> laptop<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
got it plugged into my laptop here so I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.610 
got it plugged into my laptop here so I
guess<00:00:31.710> I'll<00:00:31.859> show<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.309> does<00:00:32.460> first

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
guess I'll show you what it does first

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
guess I'll show you what it does first
here<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.890> computer<00:00:39.860> program<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.840> go

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
here my computer program that so I go

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.010 
here my computer program that so I go
here<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> serial<00:00:44.789> monitor<00:00:45.020> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
here to the go to the serial monitor and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.819 
here to the go to the serial monitor and
type<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.640> hit<00:00:47.940> enter

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
type in one and hit enter

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
type in one and hit enter
and<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> turns<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> light<00:00:51.390> on

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and as you can see the turns my light on

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.380 
and as you can see the turns my light on
it<00:00:52.410> also<00:00:52.530> turns<00:00:53.300> pin<00:00:54.300> 13<00:00:55.550> but<00:00:56.550> LED<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.149> pin<00:00:57.180> 13

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it also turns pin 13 but LED on pin 13

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.840 
it also turns pin 13 but LED on pin 13
on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.440 

actually<00:01:07.659> right<00:01:07.840> now<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:08.020> have<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.909> it<00:01:10.119> turns

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
actually right now I have it so it turns

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.719 
actually right now I have it so it turns
out<00:01:10.659> going<00:01:11.049> on<00:01:11.170> -<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:14.080> yeah<00:01:14.310> turn<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.340> off<00:01:15.520> guys

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
out going on - so yeah turn it off guys

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.060 
out going on - so yeah turn it off guys
come<00:01:15.940> over<00:01:15.970> here<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.420> hit<00:01:16.540> zero<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.950> then

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
come over here and hit zero and then

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.190 
come over here and hit zero and then
enter<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.470> I<00:01:23.500> guess<00:01:23.710> I'll<00:01:23.890> talk<00:01:24.130> about<00:01:25.200> let's

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
enter so I guess I'll talk about let's

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.469 
enter so I guess I'll talk about let's
mess<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> little<00:01:26.830> bit<00:01:29.940> so<00:01:33.090> basically<00:01:34.090> what<00:01:34.330> I've

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
mess a little bit so basically what I've

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.410 
mess a little bit so basically what I've
done<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.440> my<00:01:39.450> main<00:01:40.450> power<00:01:40.929> in<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.090> I

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
done is this is my main power in and I

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.050 
done is this is my main power in and I
just<00:01:43.810> black<00:01:44.319> as<00:01:44.530> my<00:01:44.679> heart<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.190> red<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:45.789> my

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
just black as my heart and red as my

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.609 
just black as my heart and red as my
neutral<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.729> my<00:01:49.179> safety<00:01:49.750> switch<00:01:50.020> right

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
neutral this is my safety switch right

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.830 
neutral this is my safety switch right
here<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.810> will<00:01:53.800> kill<00:01:54.100> power<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.690> rest

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
here so that will kill power to the rest

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:20.170 
here so that will kill power to the rest
of<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.940> board<00:01:59.340> okay<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.569> can<00:02:01.720> see

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:35.020 

so<00:02:24.860> case<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.129> red<00:02:26.340> wire<00:02:26.580> right<00:02:27.569> here<00:02:29.540> is

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.869 

see<00:02:36.030> attached<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.590> power<00:02:37.799> wire<00:02:38.129> all<00:02:38.760> right

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
see attached to the power wire all right

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.930 
see attached to the power wire all right
same<00:02:39.239> terminal<00:02:40.700> okay

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
same terminal okay

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.009 
same terminal okay
comes<00:02:42.360> down<00:02:42.569> here<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.049> switch<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.989> a

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
comes down here in this switch this in a

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.420 
comes down here in this switch this in a
pull<00:02:46.290> switch<00:02:47.720> goes<00:02:48.720> through<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.799> that's<00:02:50.250> what

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
pull switch goes through and that's what

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.119 
pull switch goes through and that's what
powers<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.239> rest<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.629> board<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:52.230> right

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
powers the rest of the board here right

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:00.250 
powers the rest of the board here right
there<00:02:54.560> okay

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.720 

so<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.069> is<00:03:01.269> just<00:03:02.269> my<00:03:02.450> safety<00:03:02.840> switch<00:03:03.080> say

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
so this is just my safety switch say

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.530 
so this is just my safety switch say
kills<00:03:04.730> power<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.120> everything<00:03:05.620> alright<00:03:07.540> then

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
kills power to everything alright then

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:16.000 
kills power to everything alright then
what<00:03:09.500> I've<00:03:09.680> done<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:11.590> took<00:03:12.590> power<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.709> went

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
what I've done is I took power and went

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.210 
what I've done is I took power and went
to<00:03:16.670> one<00:03:16.970> side<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.360> my<00:03:17.450> relay<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.769> then<00:03:21.950> from

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
to one side of my relay and then from

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.559 
to one side of my relay and then from
there<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:24.879> went<00:03:25.879> to<00:03:26.120> my<00:03:26.209> light<00:03:27.010> now<00:03:28.180> what<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.209> also

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
there I went to my light now what I also

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.199 
there I went to my light now what I also
did<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:31.780> okay<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.950> have<00:03:33.950> one<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.340> coming<00:03:34.489> up<00:03:34.730> and

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
did is okay I have one and coming up and

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.819 
did is okay I have one and coming up and
going<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:35.780> outlet<00:03:35.989> too<00:03:36.319> so<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.650> will

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
going to this outlet too so it will

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.319 
going to this outlet too so it will
power<00:03:37.010> this<00:03:37.129> outlet<00:03:37.459> when<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.670> turn<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.150> as

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
power this outlet when I turn it on as

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.530 
power this outlet when I turn it on as
well<00:03:40.480> I'm<00:03:41.480> gonna<00:03:41.690> be<00:03:41.810> using<00:03:42.109> that<00:03:42.230> for<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
well I'm gonna be using that for a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.080 
well I'm gonna be using that for a
different<00:03:44.540> project<00:03:45.640> I'll<00:03:46.640> show<00:03:46.849> you<00:03:46.910> when

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
different project I'll show you when

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.430 
different project I'll show you when
that's<00:03:47.209> done<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.220> what<00:03:49.459> I've<00:03:49.579> also<00:03:49.760> done<00:03:50.440> just

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.430 
that's done and what I've also done just
came<00:03:51.650> up<00:03:51.799> here<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.340> tapped<00:03:52.609> off<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:54.260> this

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
came up here and I tapped off on this

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.660 
came up here and I tapped off on this
wire<00:03:54.879> that<00:03:55.879> gives<00:03:56.150> power<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.660> relay<00:03:57.049> I

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
wire that gives power to the relay I

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.580 
wire that gives power to the relay I
went<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.910> one<00:03:59.750> side<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.140> this<00:04:00.260> single

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
went to this one side of this single

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.159 
went to this one side of this single
pole<00:04:00.739> switch<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.700> basically<00:04:03.639> jumped<00:04:05.169> jumped

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
pole switch and basically jumped jumped

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.159 
pole switch and basically jumped jumped
out<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.380> relay<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.790> if<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.090> off<00:04:09.310> up<00:04:10.310> here

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
out the relay so if it's off up here

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.500 
out the relay so if it's off up here
zero<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:14.329> off<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:15.370> quote<00:04:16.370> here<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.940> flip

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
zero so it's off I quote here and flip

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:30.360 
zero so it's off I quote here and flip
that<00:04:17.660> switch

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.570 

okay

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:45.960 

now<00:04:36.610> what<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.640> want<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.480> do<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.250> have<00:04:40.460> this

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.030 

receiver<00:04:46.970> right<00:04:47.000> here<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:48.650> what<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.800> want<00:04:48.830> to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
receiver right here and what I want to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.930 
receiver right here and what I want to
do<00:04:49.220> is<00:04:50.800> instead<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.950> turning<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.490> light<00:04:52.790> on<00:04:53.000> I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
do is instead of turning that light on I

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.540 
do is instead of turning that light on I
will<00:04:55.940> turn<00:04:57.700> this<00:04:58.700> on<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:01.100> through<00:05:01.430> the

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
will turn this on and through the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.340 
will turn this on and through the
Arduino<00:05:01.910> I'll<00:05:02.090> turn<00:05:02.330> this<00:05:02.480> really<00:05:02.810> on<00:05:02.990> will

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
Arduino I'll turn this really on will

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.410 
Arduino I'll turn this really on will
turn<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:04.930> outlet<00:05:05.930> on<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:07.970> outlet<00:05:08.270> will

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
turn this outlet on and that outlet will

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.200 
turn this outlet on and that outlet will
power<00:05:08.690> this<00:05:09.110> receiver<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.580> I'll<00:05:10.640> have<00:05:10.850> my

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.610 

music<00:05:15.190> from<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.370> laptop<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:20.720> when<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:20.930> turn

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
music from a laptop and so when I turn

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.760 
music from a laptop and so when I turn
that<00:05:21.650> on

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
that on

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:37.840 
that on
turn<00:05:24.770> this<00:05:24.890> receive

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.310 

turn<00:05:38.480> it<00:05:38.600> off<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:41.660> then<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.840> can<00:05:41.990> play<00:05:42.110> my<00:05:42.260> music

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
turn it off and then I can play my music

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:51.540 
turn it off and then I can play my music
from<00:05:42.950> here<00:05:46.150> let's<00:05:47.150> see<00:05:47.440> this<00:05:48.440> wire<00:05:48.740> right<00:05:49.870> here

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
from here let's see this wire right here

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.350 
from here let's see this wire right here
I'm<00:05:52.550> gonna<00:05:52.670> get<00:05:52.850> another<00:05:53.030> one<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.270> these

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
I'm gonna get another one of these

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.670 
I'm gonna get another one of these
solid-state<00:05:53.990> relays<00:05:54.790> and<00:05:55.790> this<00:05:56.270> wire<00:05:56.680> is

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
solid-state relays and this wire is

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.700 
solid-state relays and this wire is
hooked<00:05:58.220> up<00:05:58.430> back<00:05:58.730> in<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.270> back<00:05:59.540> of<00:05:59.570> the<00:05:59.840> dump

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
hooked up back in the back of the dump

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.920 
hooked up back in the back of the dump
right<00:06:00.830> now<00:06:01.040> but<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:02.120> just<00:06:02.360> gets<00:06:02.540> hooked<00:06:02.720> up

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
right now but this just gets hooked up

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.060 
right now but this just gets hooked up
to<00:06:03.050> back<00:06:03.200> receiver<00:06:03.590> like<00:06:03.800> you<00:06:03.920> would<00:06:04.040> a

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
to back receiver like you would a

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.610 
to back receiver like you would a
speaker<00:06:04.540> and<00:06:05.980> that'll<00:06:06.980> come<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:07.640> go<00:06:07.820> into

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
speaker and that'll come and go into

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.280 
speaker and that'll come and go into
another<00:06:09.620> one<00:06:09.800> of<00:06:09.860> these<00:06:10.900> solid-state<00:06:11.900> relays

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
another one of these solid-state relays

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:21.490 
another one of these solid-state relays
right<00:06:12.530> here<00:06:12.830> same<00:06:13.580> one<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.920> will<00:06:20.470> come<00:06:21.470> out

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
right here same one and it will come out

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.770 
right here same one and it will come out
to<00:06:21.680> another<00:06:23.290> outlet<00:06:24.290> and<00:06:25.390> when<00:06:26.390> I<00:06:26.420> play<00:06:26.720> the

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
to another outlet and when I play the

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:36.960 
to another outlet and when I play the
music<00:06:26.960> from<00:06:27.410> laptop<00:06:29.410> it<00:06:30.410> will<00:06:34.060> turn<00:06:35.060> that

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
music from laptop it will turn that

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.070 
music from laptop it will turn that
basically<00:06:37.970> what<00:06:38.630> I<00:06:38.690> want<00:06:38.870> to<00:06:38.960> do<00:06:39.080> is<00:06:39.290> I<00:06:39.440> want<00:06:39.620> to
