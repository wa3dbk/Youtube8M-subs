00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
was to see if the spawn limit still

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.729 
was to see if the spawn limit still
existed<00:00:27.820> here<00:00:28.180> on<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.509> next-gen<00:00:28.960> so<00:00:29.469> what<00:00:29.649> I'm

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
existed here on the next-gen so what I'm

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.170 
existed here on the next-gen so what I'm
just<00:00:29.890> gonna<00:00:29.980> go<00:00:30.160> ahead<00:00:30.279> and<00:00:30.520> do<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:30.849> spawn<00:00:31.149> a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
just gonna go ahead and do is spawn a

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.360 
just gonna go ahead and do is spawn a
hole<00:00:31.599> crap<00:00:32.050> ton<00:00:32.290> of<00:00:32.320> stuff<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:32.890> we're<00:00:33.280> gonna

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
hole crap ton of stuff and we're gonna

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.250 
hole crap ton of stuff and we're gonna
see<00:00:33.670> if<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:33.940> stops<00:00:34.210> me<00:00:34.390> from<00:00:34.450> spawning<00:00:34.870> them<00:00:35.110> at

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
see if it stops me from spawning them at

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.440 
see if it stops me from spawning them at
any<00:00:35.500> point<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.070> if<00:00:36.700> it<00:00:36.790> does<00:00:36.969> then<00:00:37.180> we'll<00:00:37.300> know

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
any point and if it does then we'll know

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.810 
any point and if it does then we'll know
that<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.629> spawn<00:00:37.930> limit<00:00:38.200> still<00:00:38.350> exists<00:00:38.789> so<00:00:39.789> a

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
that the spawn limit still exists so a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.670 
that the spawn limit still exists so a
lot<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.090> people<00:00:40.420> said<00:00:40.660> that<00:00:41.140> on<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.379> current

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
lot of people said that on the current

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.020 
lot of people said that on the current
gen<00:00:41.890> they<00:00:42.010> really<00:00:42.400> really<00:00:42.610> hate<00:00:42.760> that<00:00:42.820> you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
gen they really really hate that you

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.370 
gen they really really hate that you
can't<00:00:43.270> spawn<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:43.810> know<00:00:43.900> an<00:00:44.020> infinite<00:00:44.350> number

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
can't spawn you know an infinite number

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.380 
can't spawn you know an infinite number
of<00:00:44.620> things<00:00:44.740> so<00:00:45.550> we're<00:00:45.730> gonna<00:00:45.850> see<00:00:46.120> if<00:00:46.150> they

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
of things so we're gonna see if they

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.180 
of things so we're gonna see if they
were<00:00:46.450> able<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.870> fix<00:00:47.079> that<00:00:47.290> with<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.680> updated

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
were able to fix that with the updated

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.370 
were able to fix that with the updated
hardware<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:48.730> we<00:00:48.850> currently<00:00:49.090> have<00:00:49.510> on<00:00:49.750> the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
hardware that we currently have on the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.470 
hardware that we currently have on the
on<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.890> next-gen<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.550> hopefully<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.210> won't

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
on the next-gen and hopefully it won't

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.760 
on the next-gen and hopefully it won't
stop<00:00:52.750> me<00:00:52.870> from<00:00:52.960> spawning<00:00:53.290> anything<00:00:53.620> now<00:00:53.710> I'm

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
stop me from spawning anything now I'm

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.440 
stop me from spawning anything now I'm
just<00:00:53.890> trying<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.130> see<00:00:54.310> what<00:00:54.910> exactly<00:00:55.360> I<00:00:55.390> should

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
just trying to see what exactly I should

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.790 
just trying to see what exactly I should
spawn<00:00:55.750> I<00:00:55.810> think<00:00:56.110> we'll<00:00:56.200> just<00:00:56.350> spawn<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.560> bunch

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
spawn I think we'll just spawn a bunch

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.680 
spawn I think we'll just spawn a bunch
of<00:00:56.860> villagers<00:00:57.010> simply<00:00:57.880> because<00:00:58.120> I<00:00:58.149> can<00:00:58.450> so<00:00:58.630> I'm

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
of villagers simply because I can so I'm

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.360 
of villagers simply because I can so I'm
just<00:00:58.780> gonna<00:00:58.870> just<00:00:59.200> I<00:00:59.440> guess<00:00:59.920> just<00:01:00.160> spawn<00:01:00.340> a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
just gonna just I guess just spawn a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.490 
just gonna just I guess just spawn a
whole<00:01:00.579> bunch<00:01:00.760> room<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.059> see<00:01:01.300> if<00:01:01.510> at<00:01:01.989> any<00:01:02.140> point

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
whole bunch room and see if at any point

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.369 
whole bunch room and see if at any point
it<00:01:02.680> does<00:01:02.920> stop<00:01:03.250> me<00:01:03.460> from<00:01:03.670> spawning<00:01:04.210> them<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:05.049> I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
it does stop me from spawning them so I

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.690 
it does stop me from spawning them so I
don't<00:01:05.439> know<00:01:05.799> what<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.070> spawn<00:01:06.310> limit<00:01:06.579> was

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
don't know what the spawn limit was

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.770 
don't know what the spawn limit was
before<00:01:07.060> like<00:01:07.210> if<00:01:07.329> there<00:01:07.420> was<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.600> certain

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
before like if there was a certain

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.569 
before like if there was a certain
number<00:01:08.079> because<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.350> think<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.680> matters<00:01:08.860> based

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
number because I think it matters based

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.670 
number because I think it matters based
off<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:09.909> how<00:01:10.360> many<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.780> know<00:01:10.869> NPCs<00:01:11.380> there<00:01:11.560> are

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
off of how many you know NPCs there are

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.830 
off of how many you know NPCs there are
total<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.250> your<00:01:12.490> area<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.060> like<00:01:13.479> if<00:01:13.570> there<00:01:13.690> was

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
total in your area so like if there was

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.340 
total in your area so like if there was
oh<00:01:13.990> dang<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.729> there<00:01:15.909> is<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.120> maximum<00:01:16.630> number<00:01:17.320> of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
oh dang so there is a maximum number of

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.620 
oh dang so there is a maximum number of
villagers<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.159> can<00:01:18.340> spawn<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
villagers that you can spawn so the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.750 
villagers that you can spawn so the
spawn<00:01:19.840> limit<00:01:20.110> does<00:01:20.320> still<00:01:20.590> exist

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
spawn limit does still exist

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.109 
spawn limit does still exist
unfortunately<00:01:21.760> which<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.420> kind<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:23.049> too<00:01:23.380> bad

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
unfortunately which is kind of too bad

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.580 
unfortunately which is kind of too bad
again<00:01:25.119> I'm<00:01:25.299> probably<00:01:25.750> an<00:01:25.990> area<00:01:26.200> where<00:01:26.470> there

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
again I'm probably an area where there

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.800 
again I'm probably an area where there
aren't<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.920> whole<00:01:26.950> lot<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.340> villagers<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.510> I<00:01:28.540> can

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
aren't a whole lot of villagers so I can

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.390 
aren't a whole lot of villagers so I can
spawn<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.320> know<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> bunch<00:01:29.710> from<00:01:29.950> there<00:01:30.130> but

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
spawn you know a bunch from there but

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.010 
spawn you know a bunch from there but
obviously<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.970> spawn<00:01:31.210> limit<00:01:31.479> doesn't<00:01:31.780> carry

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
obviously the spawn limit doesn't carry

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.780 
obviously the spawn limit doesn't carry
over<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.440> two<00:01:32.979> different<00:01:33.130> animals<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:33.760> you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
over to two different animals so you

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.359 
over to two different animals so you
could<00:01:34.119> spawn<00:01:34.420> like<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.290> don't<00:01:35.440> even<00:01:35.530> know<00:01:35.770> how

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
could spawn like I don't even know how

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.590 
could spawn like I don't even know how
many<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.700> these<00:01:36.790> things<00:01:36.940> I'm<00:01:37.119> spawning<00:01:37.360> but

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
many of these things I'm spawning but

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.700 
many of these things I'm spawning but
the<00:01:37.720> spawn<00:01:37.930> limit<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.290> still<00:01:38.439> there

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
the spawn limit is still there

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.429 
the spawn limit is still there
unfortunately<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.960> see<00:01:41.140> there<00:01:41.290> I've

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
unfortunately you can see there I've

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.410 
unfortunately you can see there I've
reached<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.100> maximum<00:01:42.400> spawn<00:01:42.760> limit<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.119> pigs

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
reached the maximum spawn limit of pigs

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.600 
reached the maximum spawn limit of pigs
sheeps<00:01:43.869> cows<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.439> cats<00:01:44.680> because<00:01:45.369> obviously

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
sheeps cows and cats because obviously

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.100 
sheeps cows and cats because obviously
there<00:01:46.000> was<00:01:46.210> when<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:46.450> was<00:01:46.600> coming<00:01:46.869> over<00:01:46.960> here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
there was when I was coming over here

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.070 
there was when I was coming over here
you<00:01:47.320> saw<00:01:47.530> some<00:01:47.830> pigs<00:01:48.130> sheeps<00:01:48.460> cows<00:01:48.810> over<00:01:49.810> here

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
you saw some pigs sheeps cows over here

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.270 
you saw some pigs sheeps cows over here
just<00:01:50.200> like<00:01:50.320> in<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.590> field<00:01:50.740> obviously<00:01:50.979> there's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
just like in the field obviously there's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.859 
just like in the field obviously there's
some<00:01:51.369> chickens<00:01:51.640> there<00:01:51.820> but<00:01:52.330> obviously<00:01:52.720> all

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
some chickens there but obviously all

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.420 
some chickens there but obviously all
those<00:01:53.140> things<00:01:53.350> go<00:01:53.500> into<00:01:53.530> how<00:01:53.950> many<00:01:54.159> how<00:01:54.369> many

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
those things go into how many how many

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.070 
those things go into how many how many
different<00:01:54.729> things<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.119> can<00:01:55.240> spawn<00:01:55.509> but<00:01:56.020> I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
different things you can spawn but I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.780 
different things you can spawn but I
think<00:01:56.320> villagers<00:01:56.770> there's<00:01:56.950> probably<00:01:57.430> none<00:01:57.640> in

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
think villagers there's probably none in

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.039 
think villagers there's probably none in
my<00:01:57.939> immediate<00:01:58.150> area<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.840> are<00:01:59.020> currently

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
my immediate area that are currently

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.899 
my immediate area that are currently
spawned<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.280> that's<00:02:00.460> probably<00:02:00.700> about<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
spawned so that's probably about the

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.929 
spawned so that's probably about the
maximum<00:02:01.479> number<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:02.350> any<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.830> NPC<00:02:03.430> that

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
maximum number of of any one NPC that

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.580 
maximum number of of any one NPC that
you<00:02:04.060> can<00:02:04.240> spawn<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.570> an<00:02:04.930> area<00:02:05.229> which<00:02:05.439> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
you can spawn in an area which is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.899 
you can spawn in an area which is
however<00:02:05.860> many<00:02:06.130> I'd<00:02:06.310> respond<00:02:06.640> there<00:02:06.759> if<00:02:06.850> you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
however many I'd respond there if you

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.309 
however many I'd respond there if you
really<00:02:07.090> want<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.390> know<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.720> guess<00:02:08.049> you<00:02:08.170> could

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
really want to know I guess you could

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.419 
really want to know I guess you could
look<00:02:08.349> back<00:02:08.470> at<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.799> video<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.039> count<00:02:09.280> but

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
look back at the video and count but

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.499 
look back at the video and count but
it's<00:02:09.549> really<00:02:09.640> not<00:02:09.789> that<00:02:09.909> big<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.179> deal<00:02:10.299> what

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
it's really not that big of a deal what

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.449 
it's really not that big of a deal what
is<00:02:10.659> a<00:02:10.689> big<00:02:10.929> deal<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.769> fact<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.069> spawn

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
is a big deal is the fact that spawn

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.309 
is a big deal is the fact that spawn
limit<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.879> still<00:02:13.150> there<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.780> hope<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.170> was

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
limit is still there so I hope I was

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.509 
limit is still there so I hope I was
able<00:02:14.409> to<00:02:14.590> answer<00:02:14.829> you<00:02:14.920> guys<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.129> question

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
able to answer you guys this question

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.399 
able to answer you guys this question
apparently<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.060> hardware<00:02:16.510> baby<00:02:17.110> he<00:02:17.230> just

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
apparently the hardware baby he just

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.949 
apparently the hardware baby he just
isn't<00:02:17.640> accelerated<00:02:18.640> enough<00:02:18.880> yet<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.360> let<00:02:19.569> you

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
isn't accelerated enough yet to let you

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.809 
isn't accelerated enough yet to let you
be<00:02:20.110> able<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.440> spawn<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> whole<00:02:21.130> bunch<00:02:21.340> more<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
be able to spawn a whole bunch more of

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.400 
be able to spawn a whole bunch more of
any<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.660> NPC<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
any one NPC I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.380 
any one NPC I
maybe<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.130> will<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.400> maybe<00:02:24.910> they'll<00:02:25.150> raise

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
maybe this will be maybe they'll raise

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.080 
maybe this will be maybe they'll raise
the<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.660> spawn<00:02:26.290> limit<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.920> next<00:02:27.250> update

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the the spawn limit in the next update

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.150 
the the spawn limit in the next update
for<00:02:28.120> Minecraft<00:02:28.690> console<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.350> next-gen

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
for Minecraft console on the next-gen

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.470 
for Minecraft console on the next-gen
maybe<00:02:30.370> that'll<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.820> one<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.120> things<00:02:31.330> that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
maybe that'll be one of the things that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.090 
maybe that'll be one of the things that
they<00:02:31.570> change<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.830> have<00:02:33.070> a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
they change is that you can have a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.380 
they change is that you can have a
higher<00:02:33.400> spawn<00:02:33.700> limit<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.060> think<00:02:34.270> that'd<00:02:34.360> be

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
higher spawn limit and I think that'd be

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210 
higher spawn limit and I think that'd be
definitely<00:02:34.840> something<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.710> would<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:35.920> super

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
definitely something that would be super

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.700 
definitely something that would be super
cool<00:02:36.370> especially<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.990> custom<00:02:38.380> maps<00:02:38.530> and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
cool especially for like custom maps and

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.350 
cool especially for like custom maps and
adventure<00:02:39.010> maps<00:02:39.190> where<00:02:39.820> like<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.270> to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
adventure maps where like you have to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.790 
adventure maps where like you have to
spawn<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> whole<00:02:40.960> bunch<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.230> mobs<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.650> fight

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
spawn a whole bunch of mobs and fight

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.430 
spawn a whole bunch of mobs and fight
them<00:02:41.950> off<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:43.720> ones<00:02:43.990> where<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.320> like

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
them off or like ones where it's like

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.350 
them off or like ones where it's like
the<00:02:44.560> Horde<00:02:44.800> mode<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.280> Gears<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:45.910> War<00:02:46.030> where

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the Horde mode in Gears of War where

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.060 
the Horde mode in Gears of War where
there's<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.630> waves<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.200> mobs<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.560> come<00:02:47.860> I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
there's like waves of mobs that come I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.470 
there's like waves of mobs that come I
definitely<00:02:48.880> think<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.270> would<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
definitely think that that would be a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.880 
definitely think that that would be a
cool<00:02:49.690> addition<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> next<00:02:50.560> gen<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
cool addition to the next gen and I

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.320 
cool addition to the next gen and I
definitely<00:02:51.100> think<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.490> hardware<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> handle

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
definitely think the hardware can handle

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.000 
definitely think the hardware can handle
it<00:02:52.480> because<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.260> see<00:02:53.410> here<00:02:53.680> even<00:02:53.830> with

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
it because you can see here even with

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.890 
it because you can see here even with
all<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.250> these<00:02:54.370> villagers<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.030> ocelots<00:02:55.420> spawn

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
all of these villagers and ocelots spawn

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.350 
all of these villagers and ocelots spawn
I'm<00:02:56.170> still<00:02:56.830> not<00:02:56.980> lagging<00:02:57.460> even<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:58.210> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
I'm still not lagging even in the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.970 
I'm still not lagging even in the
slightest<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.110> really<00:02:59.470> do<00:02:59.590> think<00:02:59.830> that<00:02:59.860> they

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
slightest so I really do think that they

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.650 
slightest so I really do think that they
could<00:03:00.040> raise<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> spawn<00:03:00.610> limit<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.240> I<00:03:01.420> hope

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
could raise the spawn limit and I hope

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.120 
could raise the spawn limit and I hope
that<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:01.960> do<00:03:02.020> in<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.470> future<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.040> we

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
that they do in the future so that we

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.160 
that they do in the future so that we
can<00:03:03.310> like<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.610> said<00:03:03.640> have<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.270> much<00:03:04.750> larger

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
can like I said have a much larger

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.690 
can like I said have a much larger
amount<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.590> things<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:05.950> we<00:03:06.040> can<00:03:06.190> spawn<00:03:06.460> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
amount of things that we can spawn and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.820 
amount of things that we can spawn and
obviously<00:03:07.480> mitigate<00:03:07.930> any<00:03:08.110> problems<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.740> you

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
obviously mitigate any problems that you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.500 
obviously mitigate any problems that you
guys<00:03:09.010> currently<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.000> current<00:03:10.300> gen

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
guys currently have on the current gen

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.570 
guys currently have on the current gen
with<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.230> spawn<00:03:11.530> limit<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.070> said<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.310> don't

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
with the spawn limit like I said I don't

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.190 
with the spawn limit like I said I don't
know<00:03:12.700> if<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.880> spawn<00:03:13.120> limit<00:03:13.420> was<00:03:13.600> raised<00:03:13.870> at

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
know if the spawn limit was raised at

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.620 
know if the spawn limit was raised at
all<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.430> know<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.970> still<00:03:16.210> exists

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
all but I do know that it still exists

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.390 
all but I do know that it still exists
so<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.960> is<00:03:17.140> uh<00:03:17.170> that's<00:03:17.830> something<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.250> note

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
so that is uh that's something to note

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.220 
so that is uh that's something to note
so<00:03:18.670> anyway<00:03:19.270> I<00:03:19.300> hope<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.630> was<00:03:19.780> able<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.050> answer
