00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
some of these will be very familiar

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.319 
some of these will be very familiar
especially<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.369> ones<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> would<00:02:03.090> see

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
especially the ones that you would see

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.569 
especially the ones that you would see
on<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.450> classroom<00:02:04.020> wall<00:02:04.399> there<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
on your classroom wall there are a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.119 
on your classroom wall there are a
number<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.880> variations<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> one

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
number of variations here but the one

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.100 
number of variations here but the one
that<00:02:08.280> has<00:02:08.399> been<00:02:08.580> debated<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.090> recently<00:02:09.569> would

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that has been debated on recently would

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.190 
that has been debated on recently would
be<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.280> galls<00:02:11.489> Peters

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
be this one the galls Peters

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.839 
be this one the galls Peters
which<00:02:13.380> accurately<00:02:13.620> shows<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.610> size

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849

most<00:02:17.040> obvious<00:02:17.430> clue<00:02:17.700> being<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.300> white

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
most obvious clue being that the white

most obvious clue being that the white
continent<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.319> Greenland<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.010> actually<00:02:20.640> tiny

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.920 
continent of Greenland is actually tiny
compared<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.810> Africa<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.310> digress<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.810> you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
compared to Africa but I digress if you

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.210 
compared to Africa but I digress if you
keep<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.470> down<00:02:25.650> through<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.069> the

keep going down through all the
different<00:02:26.550> shapes<00:02:26.989> you'll<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.200> into

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
different shapes you'll get into

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.250 
different shapes you'll get into
circular<00:02:28.920> maps<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:30.150> only<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.690> these<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.200> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
circular maps but only one of these is a

the AE model to make things even more

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.250 
the AE model to make things even more
strange<00:03:37.500> we<00:03:38.100> go<00:03:38.280> back<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> USGS<00:03:39.239> model<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
strange we go back to the USGS model and

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.039 
strange we go back to the USGS model and
you<00:03:40.920> see<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.820> was<00:03:41.940> first<00:03:42.209> proposed<00:03:42.750> a

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
you see that it was first proposed a

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.240 
you see that it was first proposed a
thousand<00:03:43.650> years<00:03:43.920> ago

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
thousand years ago

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.990 
thousand years ago
and<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.970> may<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.359> well<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.320> bad<00:03:46.470> link

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
and you may think well that's a bad link

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.759 
and you may think well that's a bad link
so<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.030> compare<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.170> person<00:03:49.650> who

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
so you compare it with the person who

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.490 
so you compare it with the person who
proposed<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.940> get<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.299> guy<00:03:51.570> al

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
proposed it and you get this guy al

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.509 
proposed it and you get this guy al
biruni<00:03:53.329> who<00:03:54.329> was<00:03:54.540> al<00:03:54.720> biruni<00:03:55.160> while<00:03:56.160> he<00:03:56.310> lived

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
around a thousand years ago it was

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.050 
around a thousand years ago it was

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.090 
is and named this moon crater after him
so<00:04:17.310> why<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.820> usgs<00:04:18.510> using<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.470> version<00:04:19.739> of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
so why is the usgs using a version of

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.159 
so why is the usgs using a version of
the<00:04:20.220> world<00:04:20.459> map<00:04:20.729> designed<00:04:21.239> by<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.570> thousand

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
year old persian scientist because it's

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.400

correct

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
correct

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.550

that's<00:04:26.590> why<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.940> be<00:04:28.120> clear<00:04:28.570> let's<00:04:29.230> compare

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
that's why so to be clear let's compare

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.180 
that's why so to be clear let's compare
