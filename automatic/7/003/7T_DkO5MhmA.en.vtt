this lets taste more than one year to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.019 
this lets taste more than one year to
build<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:03.090> togetherness<00:00:03.890> i<00:00:04.890> think<00:00:05.640> so<00:00:05.819> i

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
build that togetherness i think so i

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.419 
build that togetherness i think so i
think<00:00:06.120> i<00:00:06.750> think<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.890> constant<00:00:08.340> learning

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
think i think it's a constant learning

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.070 
think i think it's a constant learning

beautify the 18u no cosigner does a
great<00:00:14.250> job<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.549> leading<00:00:15.420> us<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> trying<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
great job of leading us and trying to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.099 
great job of leading us and trying to
teach<00:00:16.529> us<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.660> ultimately

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
teach us how to do that but ultimately

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.960 
teach us how to do that but ultimately
you<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.949> not<00:00:20.100> something<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.550> coach<00:00:20.760> can

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
you know it's not something a coach can

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.630 
you know it's not something a coach can
physically<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.660> or<00:00:21.900> physically<00:00:22.460> implement<00:00:23.460> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
total effort to make that happen we will

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
total effort to make that happen we will
never<00:00:38.850> reach<00:00:39.059> her<00:00:39.210> potential<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> or<00:00:40.020> not

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the chasey at quarterback I think it's a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.330 
the chasey at quarterback I think it's a
circle<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.800> everybody's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
circle from you I think everybody's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
circle from you I think everybody's
gonna<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:51.000> chasing<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.140> being<00:00:52.440> chased

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.790 
gonna be chasing and we're being chased
at<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.730> point<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.149> another<00:00:54.649> just<00:00:55.649> hopefully

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
at some point or another just hopefully

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500 
at some point or another just hopefully
it's<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.399> own<00:00:56.460> tail<00:00:56.730> butt<00:00:57.000> whooping

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it's not my own tail butt whooping

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's not my own tail butt whooping
English<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.699> again<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
English I think again it's a you know I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.450 
English I think again it's a you know I
think<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> process<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.439> our<00:01:05.100> coaches

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
think it's a process i think our coaches

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
think it's a process i think our coaches
do<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> great<00:01:05.790> job<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.030> keeping<00:01:06.330> us<00:01:06.570> focused<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
do a great job of keeping us focused and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.330 
do a great job of keeping us focused and
on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.590> things<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.130> getting

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
on the right things and that's getting

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
on the right things and that's getting
better<00:01:08.580> individually<00:01:09.540> every<00:01:09.630> day<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> then

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
better individually every day and then

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
better individually every day and then
that's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> quarterback<00:01:11.310> unit<00:01:11.640> every<00:01:11.820> day<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that's a quarterback unit every day and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
that's a quarterback unit every day and

anything i gained it I wasn't taking as
many<00:01:24.630> quarterback<00:01:25.140> reps<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.560> sure<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.299> was

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
many quarterback reps for sure but I was

speed of the game and you know working

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.990 
speed of the game and you know working
with<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> guys<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.970> know

with a lot of the guys that you know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
with a lot of the guys that you know
we're<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.420> playing<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.409> fall

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
we're going to be playing this this fall

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.050 
we're going to be playing this this fall
I<00:01:37.710> mean<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.189> kind<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.759> mean<00:01:38.939> with

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
I mean just kind of do I mean with

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.870 
I mean just kind of do I mean with
building<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.479> unity<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.049> trust<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.250> just

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
building that unity and trust and just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
building that unity and trust and just
being<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> system<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:42.869> understanding

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
being in the system more understanding

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
being in the system more understanding
it<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> different<00:01:43.920> perspective<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.670> think
