00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and buying it this one costed roughly

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.900 
and buying it this one costed roughly
230<00:02:35.650> bucks<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.980> it's<00:02:39.130> really<00:02:39.280> worth<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
230 bucks but it's really worth the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.770 
230 bucks but it's really worth the
