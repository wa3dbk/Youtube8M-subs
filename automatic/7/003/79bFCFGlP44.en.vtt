00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello to all of you so I'll you 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.400
 do this little video so you 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.889
 present a new leather spot so 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.400
 my previous spot was the landmark 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.900
 so onyxia for robust copper 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.770
 so here is a new leather spot for 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.780
 the granular leather so 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.660
 here we are at kara souls 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.490
 it's a very big number one of the most 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 big and funny moreover 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.140
 chiale specified 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.640
 there are a dozen bumps in very very 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.629
 simple but we will focus 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.970
 mainly here on the first room 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.980
 so just reset have all the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.899
 bodies 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.340
 So here we go back so for 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.650
 you place a bit it is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.089
 in the parade of de yvan so that's 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.010
 find a little bit below 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.960
 howling here so it's a whole 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.390
 small area that lies between the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.690
 twilight wood the wood of the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.239
 twilight and the swamp of sorrows so 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.559
 pouf right here we have the parade here 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.119
 it's really a very small area it 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.350
 are they because chance in fact to do 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.000
 simple in 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.800
 so the wood the swamp because chance 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.680
 to get back you have to make a sequel 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 of quests so it's not very very long 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.840
 and most of you have it 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.979
 surely already done so we go inside 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.979
 here we go 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.010
 so here we are at kara 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420
 souls we open the door 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.650
 here we go directly 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.650
 on the right 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.990
 who if you do not have to kill 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.729
 all the spiders up 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.829
 knowing that one of his idea can sabler 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.240
 that he does not report anything how you have 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.979
 need some tissue in this channel 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 you bring canvases to silk 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.100
 spider 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.460
 so 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.840
 here we come to the room that goes 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.230
 to be interesting to us 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.610
 so here 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.110
 you see I have sixty two spoons 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.690
 gradual already I made a passage in 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 So here is a simplest you 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 go to big all the bats 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.840
 all con agro canvas do not they are 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.340
 almost no damage frankly 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.319
 whip all tagro without fear is no 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.440
 problem at level 90 and even a little bit more 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.460
 down they are level 71 saw did not know 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.250
 it's not death so we have big everything 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.810
 hop 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 they will stay on you do not have 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.990
 need to worry about that 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.370
 we have grown 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.690
 so do not forget to go over it because 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.670
 that as you are of a high level 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.500
 in fact if even if you go to two 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.819
 meters of it you not agro them 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.610
 so here we go 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.950
 the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.780
 so that's all the bats are 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.090
 taken so we go into the second room 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.730
 here and there there are still some bald 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.019
 mouse 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.019
 and a pack of dogs 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.050
 here 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.270
 so forgiving that all 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.520
 critters here so the bats and 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.970
 the dogs we bring you each 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.070
 between 1 and 3 granular leather 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.280
 and who sometimes between one and five 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.110
 thongs that's how it is here I have everything 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.630
 see it took me two minutes of everything 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.630
 take tak a small dam 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.470
 this is everyone died so by 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.040
 against think well have room in 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.680
 your bags 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.670
 because that for all to pick up see 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 pass a daub package 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.050
 here I already have more room in my 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.320
 bags 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.320
 hop 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.740
 with them 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.140
 you can always resell this report 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.140
 always some peace to business 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.530
 now fishes 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.140
 granular leather 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.050
 I had 62 at the base and we'll see 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.070
 right now how much I find myself 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.990
 knowing that I had done that one 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.270
 Passenger we can make five very 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.200
 every hour simply and that 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.200
 it's going very, very fast 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.400
 I just specify that here so this spot of 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.660
 leather most leather spots in 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.370
 interesting enough is 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.320
 mainly in raids or in 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.150
 dungeons because that's where 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.970
 I was explaining in fact in my video of 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.950
 lair of nice ya or there for example 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.940
 can make sixty copper 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.890
 robust at every run 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.620
 here we can do about sixty 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.100
 granular leather with each run while 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.390
 in outside directly I'm going 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.980
 say for example for the wild leather 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.180
 which is situated almost in that 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.940
 outdoors in the highlands 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.200
 mainly it's the best spot 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.520
 there is a parent 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.120
 directly each mode will you 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.150
 to bring back a wild leather is the most 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.340
 far from it anyway it is to rise from 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.580
 425 it seems to me 500 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.260
 it's going to be the longest worth 490 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.650
 wild leather that you will make a 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.979
 parent see times 2 if everything happens 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.510
 well 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.510
 if you have a chance 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.040
 so here it is mainly in 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.480
 the raids in the old red for example 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.680
 you will take the raids or at 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.370
 classic you will have a lot of leather 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.930
 what is called thick leather 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.419
 cook them on purpose is also found in 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.889
 some classic raids but by 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.930
 example here when we look at their father 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.540
 of nice yahoo car azam bugs there 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.280
 has a package and it's very very fast 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.840
 leather and even if you are not tdc 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.320
 it can still be resumed the complete 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.090
 quite easily 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.090
 so we're almost done here 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.170
 the last 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.930
 here 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.430
 so 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.430
 here so hop 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.230
 we see so I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 744 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:32.420
 granular leather 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.969
 so I did it in all 140 4 - 62 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.350
 80 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.420
 80 of granular leather 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.470
 that's really it's very fast 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.630
 it took me in total to 6 minutes 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.550
 to tell you that this is selling 4 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.750
 may at 25 probably the server the 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.200
 clairvoyance and the brain where I am 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.370
 currently 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.380
 so that's 85 p Ã´ the stack of twenty 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.810
 six minutes basically you do that five 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.340
 time half an hour it took you 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.260
 can say that she is on average that makes 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.849
 70 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.350
 70 granular leather of the hour 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:08.870
 x 5.7 x 5,350 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.980
 and you do 350 divided by two that makes 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.390
 about 10 between 17 and 18 x 85 p o 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.840
 so that's at least 1500 pairs 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.190
 almost in half an hour if everything is 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.600
 sell well there I go himself could 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.690
 put a little bit cheaper while 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.100
 just at that level and you are 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.380
 sure it starts is one of the leathers 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.000
 speak best with the robust and well 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.230
 sure the wild uc simple of the most 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.880
 difficult to farm is celebrating 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.250
 not necessarily difficult but have it 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.370
 in any case, that was so it was 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.790
 new alex for the leather video itself 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.290
 hit granules forgiveness this time 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.670
