00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
have a figure like the Bella Twins never

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.130 
have a figure like the Bella Twins never
had<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> figure<00:02:47.580> until<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.240> they'd<00:02:49.020> have

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
had a figure until that one they'd have

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.720
