00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
so what I'm here to talk to you about is

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.480 
so what I'm here to talk to you about is
getting<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:09.900> free<00:00:10.080> trees<00:00:13.160> one<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.340> ways

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
getting some free trees one of the ways

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.060 
getting some free trees one of the ways
that<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:15.059> propagate<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.630> tree<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that you can propagate a tree is to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.660 
that you can propagate a tree is to
simply<00:00:17.490> cut<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.940> limb<00:00:18.529> or<00:00:19.529> stem<00:00:19.949> off<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:22.670> what

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
simply cut a limb or stem off and what

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.380 
simply cut a limb or stem off and what
we<00:00:23.820> look<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.140> healthy<00:00:25.830> tree<00:00:26.390> non

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
we look for as a healthy tree non

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.040 
we look for as a healthy tree non
evergreen<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:31.520> we're<00:00:32.520> looking<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.210> stems<00:00:33.780> or

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
evergreen and we're looking for stems or

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.420

pencil size and what we're going to do

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.260 
pencil size and what we're going to do
is<00:00:47.190> we're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> take<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
is we're going to we're going to take a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.479 
is we're going to we're going to take a
branch<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.200> case<00:00:49.559> they'd<00:00:49.800> say<00:00:50.039> mulberry

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
branch in this case they'd say mulberry

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
branch in this case they'd say mulberry
tree<00:00:51.020> we're<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> trim<00:00:52.649> off<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
tree we're going to trim off all the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
tree we're going to trim off all the
little<00:00:53.640> side<00:00:54.239> branches<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.680> don't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
little side branches because we don't

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:08.889 
little side branches because we don't
want<00:00:56.039> any<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.460> those<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:57.329> there

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.929 

except<00:01:09.899> for<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.200> last<00:01:10.439> few<00:01:10.950> maybe<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:13.939> we're

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
except for the last few maybe and we're

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.899 
except for the last few maybe and we're
going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.090> cut<00:01:15.359> it<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:16.409> least<00:01:16.799> 18<00:01:17.250> inches<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
going to cut it at least 18 inches or so

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.870 
going to cut it at least 18 inches or so
long<00:01:18.679> we're<00:01:19.679> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.859> cut<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.069> bottom<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.640> an

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
long we're going to cut the bottom at an

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.109 
long we're going to cut the bottom at an
angle<00:01:21.329> that's<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.789> we<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:23.939> more

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
angle that's so that we have more

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.330 
angle that's so that we have more
exposed<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:25.579> uptake<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.640> water<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:28.340> then

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
exposed for uptake of water and then

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.789 
exposed for uptake of water and then
we're<00:01:29.429> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> find<00:01:29.849> a<00:01:29.969> bud<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.799> we're

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
we're going to find a bud and we're

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:41.359 
we're going to find a bud and we're
going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> cut<00:01:32.250> above<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.420> bud<00:01:36.289> so<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:40.369> we

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
going to cut above that bud so that we

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.510 
going to cut above that bud so that we
have<00:01:43.009> right<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.069> we<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.819> an<00:01:45.090> angle<00:01:45.629> cut

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
have right here we have an angle cut

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.740 
have right here we have an angle cut
just<00:01:47.520> below<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:48.299> bud<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.879> we<00:01:50.879> have<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.390> straight

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
just below a bud and we have a straight

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.099 
just below a bud and we have a straight
cut<00:01:52.879> just<00:01:53.879> above<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.750> bud<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
cut just above a bud now there's a

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.510 
cut just above a bud now there's a
couple<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.500> things<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.859> could<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.219> this

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
couple of things we could do with this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.080 
couple of things we could do with this
the<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.700> method<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.599> either<00:02:04.759> dig<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.789> trench

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the one method is to either dig a trench

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.789 
the one method is to either dig a trench
or<00:02:06.569> dig<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> hole<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.970> temporarily<00:02:09.560> put<00:02:10.560> this

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
or dig a hole to temporarily put this

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.879 
or dig a hole to temporarily put this
cutting<00:02:11.489> into<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> ground<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.769> if<00:02:13.769> you're

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:13.889 
cutting into the ground and if you're

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.080 
cutting into the ground and if you're
going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.639> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> bury

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
going to do that you're going to bury

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.140 
going to do that you're going to bury
this<00:02:15.810> cutting<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.769> way<00:02:16.859> up<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.130> about<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
this cutting all the way up to about the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.589 
this cutting all the way up to about the
last<00:02:18.389> bud<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:20.069> about<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.730> that's<00:02:21.150> how<00:02:21.329> far

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
last bud to about here that's how far

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.809 
last bud to about here that's how far
you<00:02:21.750> want<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> bury<00:02:22.169> this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> all<00:02:23.579> you

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
you want to bury this is this is all you

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.250 
you want to bury this is this is all you
want<00:02:24.030> really<00:02:24.150> sticking<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.019> or<00:02:25.139> two

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
want really sticking out is one or two

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.860 
want really sticking out is one or two
buds<00:02:25.819> basically<00:02:26.819> because<00:02:27.150> any<00:02:27.419> more<00:02:27.690> than

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
buds basically because any more than

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.259 
buds basically because any more than
that<00:02:28.049> it's<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.889> plant<00:02:29.549> itself<00:02:29.700> won't<00:02:30.090> be

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
that it's not the plant itself won't be

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.379 
that it's not the plant itself won't be
able<00:02:30.419> to<00:02:30.630> support<00:02:30.810> or<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:32.609> root<00:02:32.790> system<00:02:33.239> will

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
able to support or the root system will

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.599 
able to support or the root system will
not<00:02:33.540> be<00:02:33.690> able<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.930> support<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:35.340> growth<00:02:35.579> of

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
not be able to support the growth of

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.080 
not be able to support the growth of
much<00:02:36.389> more<00:02:36.660> than<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.950> start<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.459> as

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
much more than that to start and as

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.430 
much more than that to start and as
initially<00:02:39.419> all<00:02:39.720> you're<00:02:39.900> trying<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.169> do<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.410> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
initially all you're trying to do is to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.159 
initially all you're trying to do is to
get<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:41.190> piece<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:42.419> stem<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:44.639> Rick

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
get this this piece of this stem to Rick

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.530 
get this this piece of this stem to Rick
then<00:02:46.169> once<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.680> rooted<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.459> established<00:02:47.609> a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
then once it's rooted and established a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.509 
then once it's rooted and established a
few<00:02:48.840> months<00:02:49.049> down<00:02:49.169> the<00:02:49.230> road<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:50.160> should<00:02:50.400> be

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
few months down the road you should be

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.250

able<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.760> dig<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> back<00:02:51.299> up<00:02:53.959> sometimes<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.109> can

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
able to dig it back up sometimes you can

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.620 
able to dig it back up sometimes you can
root<00:02:55.410> them<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:56.099> as<00:02:56.250> few<00:02:56.489> as<00:02:56.549> three<00:02:57.389> or<00:02:57.480> four

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
weeks and you dig them back up and then

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.680

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
knob if you leave a nub like this where

you have something sticking out you're
going<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.810> get<00:04:34.930> disease<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.620> it's<00:04:36.160> going<00:04:36.640> to

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
going to get disease and it's going to

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.390 
going to get disease and it's going to
die<00:04:36.940> back<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.510> stem<00:04:37.720> anyhow<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.500> it's

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
die back to the stem anyhow so it's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.480 
die back to the stem anyhow so it's
better<00:04:39.610> just<00:04:39.789> to<00:04:39.910> cut<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.210> right<00:04:40.330> off<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.720> edge

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
better just to cut it right off the edge

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.340 
better just to cut it right off the edge
so<00:04:42.490> when<00:04:43.240> you're<00:04:43.360> taking<00:04:43.510> your<00:04:43.780> cuttings<00:04:44.200> keep

so when you're taking your cuttings keep

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.940 
so when you're taking your cuttings keep
that<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.680> mind<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:47.140> other<00:04:47.260> thing<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.650> keep<00:04:47.800> in

mind so you're not spreading disease is
you<00:04:51.729> want<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.030> carry<00:04:52.180> around<00:04:52.830> Clorox<00:04:53.830> wipes
