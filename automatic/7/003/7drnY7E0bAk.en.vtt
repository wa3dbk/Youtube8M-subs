00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
alright you got a copy of gyromite first

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.809 
alright you got a copy of gyromite first
thing<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.560> do<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.069> make<00:00:05.339> sure<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:05.580> doesn't

have the tabs that's a first sign of you
may<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.660> converter<00:00:10.139> inside<00:00:10.590> all<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.219> ones

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
may have a converter inside all the ones

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.089 
may have a converter inside all the ones
with<00:00:11.700> no<00:00:12.300> tabs<00:00:12.570> are<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> old<00:00:13.110> games

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.849 

and<00:00:20.099> then<00:00:20.339> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:20.970> got<00:00:21.179> five<00:00:21.859> screw

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
and then you can see it's got five screw

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.279 
and then you can see it's got five screw
holes<00:00:23.099> I<00:00:23.509> already<00:00:24.509> took<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> screws<00:00:25.019> out<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
holes I already took the screws out of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.529 
holes I already took the screws out of
this<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.149> you<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this and there you go you got the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.389 
this and there you go you got the
Famicom<00:00:27.989> converter<00:00:28.649> right<00:00:28.769> there

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
Famicom converter right there

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.720 
Famicom converter right there
get<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.000> copy<00:00:30.149> of<00:00:30.329> gyromite<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.489> let's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
get your copy of gyromite and then let's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.790 
get your copy of gyromite and then let's
create<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.030> match<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:35.030> now<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.140> tell<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
create a match it now you can tell the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.930 
create a match it now you can tell the
difference<00:00:38.159> between<00:00:38.220> these<00:00:38.550> games<00:00:38.790> because

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
difference between these games because

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.990 
difference between these games because
it'll<00:00:39.329> weigh<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.610> picked<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.730> about

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it'll weigh a lot more I picked up about

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.899 
it'll weigh a lot more I picked up about
ten<00:00:42.269> copies<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.780> gyromite<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.309> was

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
ten copies of gyromite and this one was

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.180 
ten copies of gyromite and this one was
obviously<00:00:45.899> heavier<00:00:46.500> than<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> other

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

thing that's an indicator that a copy of
gyromite<00:02:10.729> might<00:02:11.180> actually<00:02:11.420> have<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> Famicom

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
gyromite might actually have a Famicom

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.590 
gyromite might actually have a Famicom
converter<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.010> does<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:13.819> rob<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.209> robot

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
converter in it does this rob the robot

converter in it does this rob the robot
you<00:02:14.840> can<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.620> dark<00:02:16.489> purple<00:02:17.150> almost<00:02:17.390> blue

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
likely you got a converter in there and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.360 
likely you got a converter in there and
that's<00:03:57.080> what<00:03:57.320> I<00:03:57.350> look<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.799> I<00:03:57.830> felt<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.220> weight

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's what I look for I felt the weight

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.770 
that's what I look for I felt the weight
I<00:03:58.400> knew<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.730> must<00:03:58.850> have<00:03:59.000> had<00:03:59.120> one<00:03:59.329> in<00:03:59.450> there<00:03:59.630> and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
I knew it must have had one in there and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.780 
I knew it must have had one in there and
then<00:03:59.870> when<00:04:00.079> I<00:04:00.110> saw<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.890> said<00:04:01.519> aw<00:04:01.549> it's

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
then when I saw this I said aw it's

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.830 
then when I saw this I said aw it's
definitely<00:04:02.180> got<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.299> have<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.690> sure<00:04:02.810> enough

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
definitely got to have and sure enough

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.410 
definitely got to have and sure enough
it<00:04:03.200> was<00:04:03.230> in<00:04:03.440> there<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.640> keep<00:04:04.880> your<00:04:04.970> eyes<00:04:05.090> open

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
it was in there so keep your eyes open

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:15.610 
it was in there so keep your eyes open
for<00:04:05.450> that
