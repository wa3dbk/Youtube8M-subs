00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.049
 it is an understandable one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 understandable decision after you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.290
 now with van gaal somewhere this one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.900
 problems that I have just described 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.309
 Of course, he has been looking for you now 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.039
 anything but more problems 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.189
 and to oblige jupp heynckes 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.170
 he knows the club has since been two 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.699
 or even worked three times he knows 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.859
 the structures recognize the environment 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.240
 sometimes I also realize 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.609
 one or two players in the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.480
 team and so it is ultimately the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.760
 logical consequence of whether that really say 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 I like the sustainable ones 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.700
 Solution is what I did before 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 have addressed that one really times 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.350
 again continuity on the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.210
 Coach position also aspires as well as one 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 yes luck at that time had with ottmar 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.579
 hitzfeld really shape an era of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.350
 5 67 years because continuity on the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 In the end, coaching is always 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 always the basis for success and look 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.199
 you look to manchester united 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.059
 to arsenal london 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.730
 yes, all trainer in the long term 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.500
 work and then you have too 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.299
 usually the success that always has 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.979
 ask that 's what I'm so 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.710
 miss a bit it is similar to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.780
 Real Madrid Yes where is the real idea 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.470
 from soccer yes where is the real one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.909
 Philosophy according to which criteria 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 will be compiled players 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.930
 a team assembled somewhere 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 was real madrid then you always like that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.369
 the feeling there will be somewhere 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.960
 Names are bought together somewhere 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.549
 and whether they feel attending 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.310
 At times you have already been free 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.000
 you always ask yourself how 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.290
 then fit the or the player then 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.610
 really together and I think it works 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.009
 not always just about it and it shows 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.229
 barcelona very nice that you always 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.060
 only certain names now one 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.799
 big name or the once good against 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 Bavaria Munich or against Barcelona 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.240
 but you have bought 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.399
 really think what can do 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.549
 one really for the future 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.950
 strategic functional solution just 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.700
 also represent for a club 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.700
