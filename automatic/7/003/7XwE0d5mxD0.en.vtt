00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
put these in at an angle and so you'll

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
put these in at an angle and so you'll
put<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:32.310> tilt

this you it has that little curve so you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.660 
this you it has that little curve so you
lock<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> tilt<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.140> up

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670

so that you can get that one in there at
the<00:01:41.670> angle<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.810> notice<00:01:43.110> you'll<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> gap

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799

good company
and<00:02:12.599> I've<00:02:13.080> been<00:02:13.349> using<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:13.860> glasses<00:02:14.340> for

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and I've been using these glasses for

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.059 
and I've been using these glasses for
about<00:02:15.209> two<00:02:15.510> years<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.110> I'm<00:02:16.230> very<00:02:16.709> satisfied

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
about two years and I'm very satisfied

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.550 
about two years and I'm very satisfied
with<00:02:17.459> them<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.569> that's<00:02:18.720> why<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:18.989> had<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.440> the
