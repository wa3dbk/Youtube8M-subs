00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
the clay will look something like this

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.180 
the clay will look something like this
so<00:01:49.930> as<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.260> can<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.590> it's<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.920> big

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
so as you can see it's like a big

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.180 
so as you can see it's like a big
slushee<00:01:51.790> in<00:01:52.000> here<00:01:52.390> it's<00:01:52.600> just<00:01:53.010> clay

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
slushee in here it's just clay

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.859 
slushee in here it's just clay
sometimes<00:01:54.910> when<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.210> add<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.360> little<00:01:55.570> bit<00:01:55.750> too

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
sometimes when you add a little bit too

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.210 
sometimes when you add a little bit too
much<00:01:56.080> water<00:01:56.290> there<00:01:56.560> will<00:01:56.619> be<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.800> layer<00:01:57.070> of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
much water there will be a layer of

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.040 
much water there will be a layer of
water<00:01:57.460> over<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.820> top<00:01:57.850> that's<00:01:58.479> okay<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:58.900> just

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
water over the top that's okay you just

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.480 
water over the top that's okay you just
want<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.350> reach<00:01:59.560> down<00:01:59.770> into<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.130> water<00:02:00.310> and

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
want to reach down into the water and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.580 
want to reach down into the water and
grab<00:02:00.790> out<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.000> slush<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.880> once<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.240> have<00:02:04.590> the

for<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> while<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.280> depending<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.180> how<00:02:47.360> thick

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
for a while and depending on how thick

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.690 
for a while and depending on how thick
your<00:02:47.840> layer<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.290> clay<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:49.310> want<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.579> let<00:02:49.670> it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
your layer of clay is you want to let it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.140 
your layer of clay is you want to let it
sit<00:02:50.030> from<00:02:50.209> anywhere<00:02:50.569> -<00:02:50.930> like<00:02:51.110> six<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.549> eight

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
sit from anywhere - like six to eight

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.240 
sit from anywhere - like six to eight
even<00:02:53.810> sometimes<00:02:54.170> 24<00:02:54.620> hours<00:02:54.890> if<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.069> have<00:02:55.220> a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
even sometimes 24 hours if you have a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.589 
even sometimes 24 hours if you have a
really<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:55.909> thick<00:02:56.120> slab<00:02:56.329> of<00:02:56.420> play

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
really really thick slab of play

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.720 
really really thick slab of play
sometimes<00:02:57.349> what<00:02:57.560> I'll<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.159> put<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.519> clay

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
sometimes what I'll do is put the clay

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.940 
sometimes what I'll do is put the clay
on<00:02:58.879> top<00:02:58.909> I'll<00:02:59.750> peel<00:03:00.079> it<00:03:00.109> up<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.500> flip<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.799> over

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
on top I'll peel it up and flip it over

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.940 
on top I'll peel it up and flip it over
so<00:03:01.159> that<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.609> evens<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.150> out

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
so that it evens it out

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.160 
so that it evens it out
so<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:04.640> clay<00:03:04.879> is<00:03:05.030> still<00:03:05.239> not<00:03:05.420> ready<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.750> go<00:03:05.959> if

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
so this clay is still not ready to go if

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.599 
so this clay is still not ready to go if
I'm<00:03:06.379> going<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.620> sit<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:06.920> out<00:03:07.099> for<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.400> while<00:03:07.549> and

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
I'm going to sit it out for a while and

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.339 
I'm going to sit it out for a while and
I<00:03:07.849> don't<00:03:07.879> have<00:03:08.180> time<00:03:08.359> to<00:03:08.480> come<00:03:08.629> back<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:09.140> a

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
I don't have time to come back to it a

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.899 
I don't have time to come back to it a
lot<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.709> times<00:03:09.950> what<00:03:10.099> I'll<00:03:10.189> do<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.609> I'll<00:03:10.760> just

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
lot of times what I'll do is I'll just

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.210 
lot of times what I'll do is I'll just
cover<00:03:11.689> it<00:03:11.930> sort<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> tent<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.829> little<00:03:13.040> bit

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
cover it sort of tent it a little bit

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.280 
cover it sort of tent it a little bit
with<00:03:13.639> it<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:14.030> light<00:03:14.269> layer<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.720> plastic

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
with it just a light layer of plastic

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.629 
with it just a light layer of plastic
and<00:03:15.500> that'll<00:03:15.709> keep<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.010> drug<00:03:16.250> that's<00:03:16.430> talked

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
and that'll keep the drug that's talked

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.449 
and that'll keep the drug that's talked
from<00:03:16.849> drying<00:03:17.180> out<00:03:18.010> sometimes<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.129> have<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.400> do

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
from drying out sometimes you have to do

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.589 
from drying out sometimes you have to do
that<00:03:19.609> if<00:03:19.730> you're<00:03:19.849> planning<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.239> leaving<00:03:20.299> it

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
that if you're planning on leaving it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.780 
that if you're planning on leaving it
out<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> little<00:03:21.019> bit<00:03:21.200> longer<00:03:21.379> than<00:03:21.620> normal<00:03:22.010> when

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
out a little bit longer than normal when

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.309 
out a little bit longer than normal when
the<00:03:22.879> clay<00:03:23.060> is<00:03:23.090> ready<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.569> come<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.780> you'll<00:03:24.079> know

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
the clay is ready to come up you'll know

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.349 
the clay is ready to come up you'll know
because<00:03:24.950> you'll<00:03:25.159> be<00:03:25.459> able<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.760> actually<00:03:26.120> peel

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
because you'll be able to actually peel

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.360 
because you'll be able to actually peel
it<00:03:26.540> up<00:03:26.689> and<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.769> won't<00:03:28.010> stick

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
it up and it won't stick

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.820 
it up and it won't stick
