working on so far since the last video
I've<00:00:12.650> gotten<00:00:13.630> the<00:00:16.390> 6-cylinder<00:00:17.390> mount<00:00:18.340> cut<00:00:19.340> out

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
I've gotten the 6-cylinder mount cut out

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.070 
I've gotten the 6-cylinder mount cut out
and<00:00:20.080> drilled<00:00:21.080> for<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:21.440> mounting<00:00:22.039> pin<00:00:23.080> still

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
and drilled for the mounting pin still

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.000 
and drilled for the mounting pin still
have<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.470> weld<00:00:24.710> it<00:00:24.890> on<00:00:26.350> haven't<00:00:27.350> been<00:00:27.619> able<00:00:27.770> to

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
have to weld it on haven't been able to

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.980 
have to weld it on haven't been able to
weld<00:00:28.190> for<00:00:28.369> last<00:00:28.520> couple<00:00:28.850> weeks<00:00:29.000> he<00:00:29.330> has<00:00:29.449> been

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
weld for last couple weeks he has been

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.680 
weld for last couple weeks he has been
in<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.520> 20s<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.629> 30s<00:00:32.890> Celsius<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.630> way<00:00:35.630> too

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
in the 20s to 30s Celsius and way too

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.240 
in the 20s to 30s Celsius and way too
hot<00:00:36.160> so<00:00:37.870> wait<00:00:38.870> hoping<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:39.440> cools<00:00:39.829> down<00:00:39.950> a<00:00:40.100> bit

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
hot so wait hoping it cools down a bit

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.160 
hot so wait hoping it cools down a bit
in<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.510> next<00:00:41.809> few<00:00:41.930> days<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.969> arm<00:00:47.600> looks<00:00:47.989> like

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
in the next few days the arm looks like

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.650 
in the next few days the arm looks like
a<00:00:48.200> guy<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:48.950> lifts<00:00:49.430> quite<00:00:49.640> far<00:00:50.000> up<00:00:50.180> actually

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
a guy it lifts quite far up actually

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.410 
a guy it lifts quite far up actually
that<00:00:51.320> I've<00:00:51.440> noticed<00:00:52.090> so<00:00:54.129> good<00:00:55.129> for<00:00:55.340> loading

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
still have a whip mounted the bottom

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.029 
still have a whip mounted the bottom
hinge<00:01:02.809> hinge<00:01:03.379> point<00:01:03.710> there<00:01:05.649> get<00:01:06.649> around<00:01:06.890> to

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
hinge hinge point there get around to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.609 
hinge hinge point there get around to
that<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.869> joysticks<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.170> going<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.590> use

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
that the joysticks I was going to use

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.609 
that the joysticks I was going to use
for<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.279> I<00:01:14.259> was<00:01:15.259> going<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.529> get<00:01:15.799> them<00:01:15.920> from

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
for it I was going to get them from

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.529 
for it I was going to get them from
northern<00:01:18.619> northern<00:01:19.310> tool<00:01:21.880> but<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.090> checked

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
northern northern tool but I checked

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.949 
northern northern tool but I checked
today<00:01:23.929> and<00:01:24.819> they're<00:01:25.819> no<00:01:26.299> longer<00:01:26.479> available

restocking them so I'll have to find

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.690 
restocking them so I'll have to find
something<00:01:32.770> have<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.950> improvise<00:01:34.249> for

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
something have to improvise for

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.699 
something have to improvise for
something<00:01:35.119> else<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.569> you're<00:01:35.719> fine<00:01:35.990> different

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
something else so you're fine different

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.849 
something else so you're fine different
joysticks<00:01:37.159> or<00:01:37.340> something<00:01:37.789> so<00:01:40.599> yeah<00:01:41.599> I'll<00:01:41.859> hold

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
joysticks or something so yeah I'll hold

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.709 
joysticks or something so yeah I'll hold
the<00:01:43.039> boom<00:01:43.249> up<00:01:43.429> so<00:01:43.609> it<00:01:43.729> looks<00:01:43.999> like<00:01:44.119> its<00:01:44.389> meaning

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
the boom up so it looks like its meaning

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:59.750 
the boom up so it looks like its meaning
hold<00:01:44.929> down<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.229> road

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.160 

well<00:02:00.760> there's<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.270> boom<00:02:01.450> folded<00:02:01.960> up

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.540 

cylinders<00:02:05.170> got<00:02:05.350> plenty<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.800> Cowell<00:02:06.160> even<00:02:06.400> with

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
cylinders got plenty of Cowell even with

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
cylinders got plenty of Cowell even with
the<00:02:06.700> large<00:02:07.630> level<00:02:08.170> leverage<00:02:09.039> point<00:02:09.899> i<00:02:11.850> have

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the large level leverage point i have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.620 
the large level leverage point i have
like<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:15.070> space<00:02:15.610> at<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.910> cylinder

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
like that the space at the cylinder

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.460 
like that the space at the cylinder
spaced<00:02:17.020> from<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.820> arm<00:02:18.820> hinge<00:02:19.209> point<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
spaced from the arm hinge point to the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.560 
spaced from the arm hinge point to the
cylinder<00:02:23.890> hinge<00:02:24.160> point<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.670> lot<00:02:25.090> farther

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
cylinder hinge point is a lot farther

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.240 
cylinder hinge point is a lot farther
than<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:28.270> some<00:02:28.750> plan<00:02:29.140> Z<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> stuff<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.100> can

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
than in some plan Z and stuff you can

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.760 
than in some plan Z and stuff you can
buy<00:02:30.400> online<00:02:30.640> but<00:02:32.580> lava<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:34.360> only<00:02:35.200> need<00:02:35.620> to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
buy online but lava well only need to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
buy online but lava well only need to
dig<00:02:36.010> about<00:02:36.300> 56<00:02:37.300> feet<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.489> future<00:02:39.610> I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
dig about 56 feet and in the future I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.110 
dig about 56 feet and in the future I
can<00:02:39.910> always<00:02:40.720> shorten<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.350> up<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.030> put<00:02:43.030> it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
can always shorten that up so put it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.949 
can always shorten that up so put it
like<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.270> for<00:02:43.450> now<00:02:43.750> get<00:02:44.080> lots<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.500> lifting

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
like that for now get lots of lifting

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.380 
like that for now get lots of lifting
capability<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.680> won't<00:02:47.890> be<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.190> jumpy<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:50.370> I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
capability and it won't be so jumpy so I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.160 
capability and it won't be so jumpy so I
cut<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.190> ears<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.610> bucket<00:02:56.910> add<00:02:57.910> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
cut up the ears for the bucket add a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
cut up the ears for the bucket add a
piece<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.230> angle<00:03:00.720> um<00:03:02.040> they're<00:03:03.060> two<00:03:04.060> pieces<00:03:04.510> of

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
piece of angle um they're two pieces of

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:17.009 
piece of angle um they're two pieces of
let's<00:03:06.190> see<00:03:07.680> thank<00:03:08.680> their<00:03:08.890> boat<00:03:15.870> for<00:03:16.870> inch

angle iron so buy one for thick so it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.670 
angle iron so buy one for thick so it
should<00:03:27.910> be<00:03:27.940> strong<00:03:28.209> enough<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:28.989> I've<00:03:29.320> drilled

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
should be strong enough so I've drilled

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.910 
should be strong enough so I've drilled
the<00:03:29.860> hole<00:03:30.070> for<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:31.380> bushing<00:03:32.380> housing<00:03:32.739> here

of this smaller rod unfortunately but I
got<00:03:44.370> picked<00:03:45.370> up<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.610> bunch<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:46.170> bushings<00:03:47.170> from

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
got picked up a bunch of bushings from

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.460 
got picked up a bunch of bushings from
Prince<00:03:48.220> Sado<00:03:51.269> they<00:03:52.269> already<00:03:52.480> have<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.930> grease

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
Prince Sado they already have the grease

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.460 

that'll<00:04:06.450> slide<00:04:06.720> right<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.350> there<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:12.470> I'll

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
that'll slide right in there and I'll

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.560 
that'll slide right in there and I'll
weld<00:04:13.680> around<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.250> outside<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.210> grind

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570

bought<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.590> 18<00:04:22.760> lip<00:04:23.760> off<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.210> off<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.900> boom

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
bought a 18 lip off that off the boom

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.990 
bought a 18 lip off that off the boom
then<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.140> I'll<00:04:28.620> drill<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.010> hole<00:04:29.130> for<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.610> grease

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
then I I'll drill a hole for the grease

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.330 
then I I'll drill a hole for the grease
nipple<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.510> can<00:04:30.720> greased<00:04:30.990> up<00:04:31.200> there<00:04:32.070> and

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
nipple so I can greased up there and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.540 
nipple so I can greased up there and
then<00:04:32.550> I'm<00:04:33.540> going<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.750> also<00:04:33.900> be<00:04:34.400> drilling<00:04:35.400> a

then I'm going to also be drilling a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.310 
then I'm going to also be drilling a
hole<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.760> hearing<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.450> hole<00:04:36.960> into<00:04:37.140> the

another hole drilled boat up here

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.950 
another hole drilled boat up here
somewhere<00:04:57.590> for<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.910> bucket<00:04:59.910> linkage<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.450> for

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
somewhere for the bucket linkage it for

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.350 
somewhere for the bucket linkage it for
the<00:05:01.080> red<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.530> some<00:05:01.680> other<00:05:01.920> attaches<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:08.360> he's

going to pause it at first I can I'll go

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.710 
going to pause it at first I can I'll go
show<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:12.530> cut<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.830> linkage<00:05:14.490> if<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:14.940> if

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
show you the cut the linkage if you if

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.540 
show you the cut the linkage if you if
you're<00:05:16.080> watching<00:05:16.260> me<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.620> haven't<00:05:17.010> seen<00:05:17.340> any

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
you're watching me I haven't seen any

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.440 
you're watching me I haven't seen any
linkage<00:05:18.000> like<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.420> or<00:05:18.570> anything<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.830> hang<00:05:20.010> on

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.610 

all<00:05:24.450> right<00:05:24.570> this<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:24.840> what<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.170> wanted<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.500> show

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
all right this is what I wanted to show

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.730 
all right this is what I wanted to show
you<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:26.730> linkage<00:05:27.360> that'll<00:05:27.750> be<00:05:27.900> basically<00:05:28.560> the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
you the linkage that'll be basically the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.850 
you the linkage that'll be basically the
same<00:05:28.920> except<00:05:29.430> a<00:05:29.550> lot<00:05:29.730> smaller<00:05:30.590> this<00:05:31.590> is<00:05:31.740> the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
same except a lot smaller this is the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.280 
same except a lot smaller this is the
linkage<00:05:32.190> on<00:05:32.340> ax<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:33.620> john<00:05:34.620> deere<00:05:34.830> 135<00:05:35.730> CE<00:05:36.290> so

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
linkage on ax a john deere 135 CE so

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.460 
linkage on ax a john deere 135 CE so
it'll<00:05:37.620> be<00:05:37.740> quite<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.280> bit<00:05:38.610> smaller<00:05:38.760> for<00:05:39.270> my<00:05:40.230> back

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
it'll be quite a bit smaller for my back

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.270 
it'll be quite a bit smaller for my back
oh<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.940> was<00:05:41.940> thinking<00:05:42.360> about<00:05:42.420> doing<00:05:42.750> a<00:05:43.280> quick

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
oh I was thinking about doing a quick

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.580 
oh I was thinking about doing a quick
change<00:05:46.220> same<00:05:47.220> as<00:05:47.370> this<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:47.850> in<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:49.230> future<00:05:49.470> I

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
change same as this but in the future I

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.190 
change same as this but in the future I
might<00:05:49.830> not<00:05:50.430> right<00:05:50.670> now<00:05:50.850> I<00:05:50.880> know<00:05:51.120> it's<00:05:51.810> kind<00:05:52.140> of

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
might not right now I know it's kind of

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.070 
might not right now I know it's kind of
one<00:05:52.610> I'll<00:05:53.610> do<00:05:53.850> it<00:05:53.940> just<00:05:54.420> with<00:05:54.540> the<00:05:54.660> pins<00:05:54.840> for

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
one I'll do it just with the pins for

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.710 
one I'll do it just with the pins for
now<00:05:55.200> and<00:05:55.700> so

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.530 
tire for 2999 dry found a bit expensive
but<00:06:21.020> i<00:06:21.410> had<00:06:21.860> to<00:06:21.980> buy<00:06:22.100> it<00:06:22.160> had<00:06:22.880> to<00:06:23.120> get<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.360> job

but i had to buy it had to get the job
done<00:06:23.570> so<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:26.330> expensive<00:06:27.640> I<00:06:28.640> have<00:06:29.540> been<00:06:29.810> using

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
done so it's expensive I have been using

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.460 
done so it's expensive I have been using
this<00:06:30.620> a<00:06:30.680> step<00:06:31.010> step<00:06:31.910> it<00:06:32.180> step<00:06:32.870> drill<00:06:33.110> bit<00:06:33.320> I've

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
this a step step it step drill bit I've

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.290 
this a step step it step drill bit I've
had<00:06:33.710> this<00:06:33.920> bit<00:06:34.160> for<00:06:34.340> about<00:06:34.520> five<00:06:34.820> years<00:06:35.120> and

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
had this bit for about five years and

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.750 
had this bit for about five years and
only<00:06:36.290> used<00:06:36.620> it<00:06:36.770> for<00:06:36.800> meddling<00:06:37.720> works<00:06:38.720> great<00:06:39.020> so

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
only used it for meddling works great so

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.220 
only used it for meddling works great so
they<00:06:40.760> don't<00:06:40.910> tend<00:06:41.270> to<00:06:41.360> go<00:06:41.570> doll<00:06:41.900> too<00:06:42.170> fast<00:06:42.470> but

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
they don't tend to go doll too fast but
