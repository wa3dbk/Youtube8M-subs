00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.260
If you happen to be in the south-central
region of Pennsylvania and you're

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.629
looking for an interesting place to hike,

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.070
you might want to pay a visit to the
thousand steps.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.939
The trailhead for the thousand steps is
located on route 22 about two

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.240
miles west of Mount Union.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.830
This is where the road follows the
Juniata River

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.980
through a narrow gorge known as Jack's
Narrows with high ridges on either side.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.989
This was named for a trader by the name
of Jack Armstrong who lived in the

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.710
1700s.  It was near this
location in February of 1744

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.239
where Jack and his two servants were
killed by some indians after a dispute

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.239
over a horse.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.020
The thousand steps were built in the
1930s by miners who climbed

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.940
the mountain each day to work in the
quarry.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.510
Sandstone mined from the quarry was
then taken to Mt Union where it  was made into

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.430
bricks. At one time Mt Union was the largest
producer of silica bricks in the world

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.670
and became known as the "brick capital of
the world".

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.270
How long it takes to climb the steps
depends on how physically fit you are

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.300
but for most people will take between
twenty minutes and one hour.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.330
At each 100-step interval you'll
see a number of painted on the rocks to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.630
tell you how many steps you've climbed.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.630
The actual number of steps is 1043.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.550
Upon reaching the top of the steps you
can turn either

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.800
right or left to continue exploring.
Turning to the right will take you to a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.620
lookout that will allow you to catch a
glimpse of the town of Mt Union.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.149
If you turn left the path will lead you
to a concrete building.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.689
This building housed the locomotive that
moved the sandstone from the quarry to the

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.790
bottom of the mountain.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.659
If you still have some energy left,
climb the steps beside the building

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.299
that lead a little higher up the mountain.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.790
After a short climb you'll come to trail that
leads further along the mountainside.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.350
After walking about half a mile you'll
come to a lookout that allows you to see

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.280
the town of Mapleton along with the
railroad, route 22

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.280
and the Juniata River.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.819
This section of land is available to the
public because the work and financial

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.849
support of many individuals and
organizations.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.209
So take the time to enjoy it, and be sure
to leave it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.929
as you found it,
