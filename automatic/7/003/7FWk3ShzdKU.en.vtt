off big chunks of wood because the edge
it's<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> knife<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> machete<00:01:16.130> but

so let's roll in that footage and then
we'll<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> throwing

hurl<00:04:44.640> bats<00:04:45.000> I<00:04:45.300> know<00:04:45.690> they're<00:04:45.990> kind<00:04:46.170> of

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
hurl bats I know they're kind of

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.180 
hurl bats I know they're kind of
expensive<00:04:46.890> for<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.160> throwing<00:04:47.640> axe<00:04:48.170> it<00:04:49.190> they're

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
expensive for a throwing axe it they're

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.560 
expensive for a throwing axe it they're
$200<00:04:51.120> for<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.390> set<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.780> three<00:04:52.940> but<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:53.970> gotta<00:04:54.270> say

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
$200 for a set of three but I gotta say

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.990 
$200 for a set of three but I gotta say
these<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:55.110> very<00:04:55.500> very<00:04:55.920> high<00:04:56.190> quality

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
these are very very high quality

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.020 
these are very very high quality
that<00:04:57.570> when<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.900> throw<00:04:58.260> them<00:04:58.560> all<00:04:59.160> in<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.790> set

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
that when you throw them all in a set

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.350 
that when you throw them all in a set
like<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.990> are<00:05:01.170> going<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:02.360> basically

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
like that you are going to basically

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.810 
like that you are going to basically
have<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.050> kind<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.410> repair<00:05:04.830> them<00:05:05.100> after<00:05:05.790> a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
have to kind of repair them after a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.650 
have to kind of repair them after a
session<00:05:06.150> because<00:05:06.780> it's<00:05:07.560> inevitable<00:05:08.480> this<00:05:09.480> is

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
session because it's inevitable this is

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.870 
session because it's inevitable this is
stuck<00:05:09.930> in<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.200> target<00:05:10.710> sometimes<00:05:11.370> you're

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
stuck in the target sometimes you're

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.720 
stuck in the target sometimes you're
accidentally<00:05:12.390> going<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:12.720> hit<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.140> hurl<00:05:13.350> bat

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
with another hurled that and you see

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.100 
with another hurled that and you see
those<00:05:16.920> little<00:05:17.040> like<00:05:17.940> little<00:05:18.210> gashes<00:05:18.720> and

those little like little gashes and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.990 
those little like little gashes and
marks<00:05:19.380> right<00:05:19.560> there<00:05:19.620> are<00:05:20.370> just<00:05:20.670> from<00:05:20.850> the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
marks right there are just from the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.920 
marks right there are just from the
steel<00:05:21.300> on<00:05:21.510> steel<00:05:22.220> contact<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.300> hurl<00:05:24.630> bets

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
steel on steel contact so you hurl bets

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.890 
steel on steel contact so you hurl bets
will<00:05:25.260> get<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> little<00:05:25.710> bit<00:05:26.360> damaged<00:05:27.360> from<00:05:27.630> steel

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
will get a little bit damaged from steel

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.830 
will get a little bit damaged from steel
on<00:05:28.110> steel<00:05:28.140> contact<00:05:29.270> but<00:05:30.270> they<00:05:30.390> are<00:05:30.510> pretty

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
on steel contact but they are pretty

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.350 
on steel contact but they are pretty
easy<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.290> repair<00:05:31.890> for<00:05:32.280> challenge<00:05:32.730> purposes

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
with all three just because that makes

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.270 
with all three just because that makes
it<00:05:38.640> more<00:05:38.760> difficult<00:05:39.110> okay<00:05:40.110> if<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:40.919> don't<00:05:41.070> want

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
it more difficult okay if you don't want

because<00:05:57.480> you<00:05:58.020> know<00:05:58.140> this<00:05:58.290> is<00:05:58.440> where<00:05:58.620> I<00:05:58.650> throw

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
because you know this is where I throw

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.890 
because you know this is where I throw
it<00:05:59.100> from<00:05:59.250> I<00:05:59.340> don't<00:05:59.490> really<00:05:59.850> want<00:06:00.150> that<00:06:00.270> part<00:06:00.720> to

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
here you know because it just sticks

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.880 
here you know because it just sticks
