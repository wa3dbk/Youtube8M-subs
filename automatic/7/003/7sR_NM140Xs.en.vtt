00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.950
 here it has a momentary consumption and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.880
 When I'm going over here, he's going to show 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:57.810
 other options travel time alert 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:02.610

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.590
 autonomy and returned to the average consumption 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.980
 we have a computer there 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:20.670

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:31.990
 fuel level and speedometer 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:34.450
 analog that is the new radio of the goal that 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.070
 is integrated into the panel with this 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.060
 black piano finish that 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.060
 very cute 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.680
 the air conditioning controls 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.120
 I can not let the sound on too much 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.790
 time because youtube will charge 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.790
 copyright of the song right there 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:18.729
 interesting the tilt down system of sex 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:23.530
 of the outside rearview mirror which 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:26.639
 when you engage the active 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:32.349
 that the electric rear view mirror 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:48.720
 to the outside right and when it engages 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:58.210
 aft the mirror alone and on the radio 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:00.449
 it shows an obstacle I disengage 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.110
 was alone to the original position 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.110
 very interesting system 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.919
 Another interesting thing is that 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:20.139
 sun breaks when you open from 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:24.340
 of the mirror is accepted both from the name 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:30.180
 the driver's side and the 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:36.060
 system integration 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.060
 win of such here levers 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:46.580
 all the lights of the mirrors 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:51.020
 direction 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:54.910
 all of them ignite the 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.910
 passenger passengers 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:05.180
 once again emphasizes that these 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.970
 banks does not come with this goal with this 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:13.250
 version 18 30 is this here are layers of 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:16.990
 curve than leather limitation than what 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.610
 I had it made and put on the benches. 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.800
 It was very cool, I thought. 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.780
 Imagine being so good is not there. 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:38.540
 I ended up really enjoying some of them. 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:40.810
 Portuguese already says glove holder taken from 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.810
 12 volts 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.370
 the detail of the air vents as well 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.370
 interesting 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:13.620
 then the port objects here one thing 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.770
 I did not like it very much and arrived at this 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.470
 car was that point object on the door is 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.850
 very small compared to others 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.850
 cars we have the same segment 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.840
 Here are some more technical 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.710
 direction and I found it very 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:36.900
 generation has a good footprint too much 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:39.470
 very interesting the use of cool 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.470
