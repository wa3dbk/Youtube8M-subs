knew everything already it wouldn't be a
mystery<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:28.259> other<00:01:28.380> problem<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.009> have

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
mystery the other problem that we have

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.789 
mystery the other problem that we have
to<00:01:29.369> deal<00:01:29.549> with<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:30.030> whether<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.900> trust<00:01:31.229> the
