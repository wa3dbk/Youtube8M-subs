00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello everyone, happy wolf subscribers 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.359
 crying again about team games 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 so here in fact I wanted to play with 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.200
 I'm already tired of battlefield 3 if 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 honestly we will definitely return to it but 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.410
 after the break for now let's 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.780
 let's play the second bow and tons 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.330
 free roomy and we played 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.460
 him a couple of times long ago in short 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 all the old guys on phobias that is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 on Russian servers plays fewer people 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 so we will not go there I suggest 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 again to Europe with the Turks with the Poles 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 who do not realize at all about 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 tom what they do 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.250
 shorter explain for those who do not have 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 account in the planet who is not 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 understands what is happening you go on 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 planet side 2 dot com site in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.430
 google and the very first result 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 press cry alder I create shorter 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.539
 account you will be just a couple of seconds 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 to cancel page loading otherwise 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 you will stick a banner about what you from 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 Russia went fuck out of here you have supposedly 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.430
 fogeym and domestic servers europe not 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.930
 wants to play nothing like you 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.770
 just do not know what they refuse from 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.690
 we have tents 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.129
 if that page can be at least 10 times 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 update and try to prevent 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.080
 loading there is another way of some kind 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.909
 was more complicated but i forgot shorter 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
 register for those who have and i am 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.250
 Cancer in what problems do not arise 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.229
 must 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.790
 I will immediately say that the game weighs up doherischa 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.830
 so download check for updates 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.229
 in advance, but I myself just had a game 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 I opened and there on 9 gigs of horseradish sleep 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.869
 server miller side conglomerate this 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.930
 blue day saturday and tomorrow it 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.780
 we will be on May 16 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 time 1300 Moscow just everything 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.150
 wake up here we will slowly 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 collect 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 i will create a platoon called happy team 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 and there ferret 15 people can 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.890
 recruit how to join in a platoon myself 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.930
 already if you honestly forgot well, sort of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.060
 English key and if that in 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.799
 settings, I think I think for half an hour 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 there while we wait we'll figure it out 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.210
 principle from called squad platoon this 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.040
 few squads but I don't know at all 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 how does this garbage work so something 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.329
 VKontakte write I will do then 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.310
 We are going if we're on the main base 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.380
 conglomerate where the terminal with the flight 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.719
 technique well shorter right near spawn 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 you can't go wrong on the planet 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.590
 recently somewhere half a year ago maybe a little 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.050
 more have entered completely crazy 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 locking system 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.830
 these locations, that is, if your 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.170
 conglomerate for example sucked the base then you 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.330
 can go fucking from the continent to everyone 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.740
 composition of happy tim even if you are us 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.600
 you at the same time 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.520
 so I can't tell you in advance on 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.650
 which of 4 locations we will play like that 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.960
 what are watching the order of priority from us 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.300
 There is a winter card if it will fuck up 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.970
 blocked let's move to the second card this 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 where giant oaks and larches grow 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.600
 i don't know i ca n't here continent 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.610
 In short, he is called the newest in my opinion 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.020
 there grow giant trees which 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.190
 you can jump on which we just 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.560
 played for the very first time 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.110
 if both of these cards and in the block then we go to 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.020
 forest there is something forest types and steppe and 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.820
 forest steppe I have no idea shorter there if 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.120
 all these three in the block then we go to 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.070
 last desert like this on this i 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.600
 I think all if a king's questions then 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.640
 set them in the comments in principle not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.010
 there must be no problems of 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.990
 account lock in regions not with 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.120
 block location pro advance warning 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.460
 you never know what all the happiness will be waiting 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 you tomorrow time still shaking doherischa 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.500
 I think we will have time to play there soon
