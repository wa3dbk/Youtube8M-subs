production<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.690> testosterone<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> was

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
production of testosterone so I was

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.570 
production of testosterone so I was
that's<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> one<00:02:33.560> thing<00:02:33.769> about<00:02:33.800> Tesla<00:02:34.310> fuel<00:02:34.519> I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
that's the one thing about Tesla fuel I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580 
that's the one thing about Tesla fuel I
wasn't<00:02:35.000> really<00:02:35.209> afraid<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.050> try<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.319> just

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
wasn't really afraid to try it just

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.490 
wasn't really afraid to try it just
because<00:02:36.680> looking<00:02:37.130> at<00:02:37.280> those<00:02:37.489> ingredients

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
because looking at those ingredients

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.770 
because looking at those ingredients
none<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.620> them<00:02:39.739> really<00:02:39.890> scared<00:02:40.280> me<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.120> took<00:02:41.660> it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
none of them really scared me so took it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.500 
none of them really scared me so took it
for<00:02:41.930> 90<00:02:42.170> days<00:02:42.200> or<00:02:42.620> 30<00:02:43.250> days<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:44.060> was<00:02:44.180> 90

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
for 90 days or 30 days it was 90

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.830 
for 90 days or 30 days it was 90
capsules<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.170> take<00:02:45.380> three-day<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.510> going

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
capsules you take three-day and going

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.170 
capsules you take three-day and going
into<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.730> wasn't<00:02:49.730> really<00:02:49.910> worried<00:02:50.090> about

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
into this I wasn't really worried about

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.780 
into this I wasn't really worried about
my<00:02:50.510> testosterone<00:02:50.720> level<00:02:51.410> anyways<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:52.010> actually

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
my testosterone level anyways I actually

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.979 
my testosterone level anyways I actually
think<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.269> probably<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.630> pretty<00:02:53.750> high

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
think I probably have pretty high

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.039 
think I probably have pretty high
testosterone<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.269> didn't<00:02:56.510> expect<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> see

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
testosterone and I didn't expect to see

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.360 
testosterone and I didn't expect to see
a<00:02:57.200> whole<00:02:57.500> lot<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:59.049> effects<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.350> really<00:03:01.220> don't

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
a whole lot of effects I really don't

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.020 
a whole lot of effects I really don't
think<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.700> did<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.450> talking<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> few<00:03:03.739> people

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
think I did and talking to a few people

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.030 
think I did and talking to a few people
they<00:03:05.030> think<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.510> know<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:06.410> already<00:03:06.560> lifting

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
they think you know you already lifting

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.949 
they think you know you already lifting
a<00:03:07.130> ton<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.340> weights<00:03:07.609> you're<00:03:07.850> thinking<00:03:08.720> mass

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
a ton of weights you're thinking mass

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.130 
a ton of weights you're thinking mass
like<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:10.070> am<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.579> they<00:03:11.480> didn't<00:03:11.690> think<00:03:11.870> that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
like I am and they didn't think that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.080 
like I am and they didn't think that
testosterone<00:03:13.010> booster<00:03:13.609> would<00:03:13.700> really<00:03:13.880> have

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
testosterone booster would really have

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.920 
testosterone booster would really have
that<00:03:14.239> much<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.510> an<00:03:14.720> effect<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:15.170> me<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:16.780> for<00:03:17.780> me<00:03:17.900> I

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that much of an effect on me so for me I

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.960 
that much of an effect on me so for me I
probably<00:03:18.410> wouldn't<00:03:19.010> use<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.459> testosterone

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
probably wouldn't use a testosterone

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.030 
probably wouldn't use a testosterone
booster<00:03:20.630> again<00:03:22.180> if<00:03:23.180> if<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.290> may<00:03:24.530> be<00:03:24.590> looking

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
booster again if if you may be looking

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.910 
booster again if if you may be looking
for<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.310> extra<00:03:25.760> little<00:03:25.790> edge<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.650> want

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
for that extra little edge and you want

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.039 
for that extra little edge and you want
to<00:03:28.010> give<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.280> shot<00:03:28.549> I<00:03:28.820> mean<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.780> safe

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
to give it a shot I mean it's it's safe

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.560 
to give it a shot I mean it's it's safe
to<00:03:30.260> try<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.859> that's<00:03:31.549> up<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.359> think

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
to try and that's up to you if you think

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.479 
to try and that's up to you if you think
it's<00:03:32.690> worth<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.049> or<00:03:33.170> not<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.590> didn't<00:03:34.190> notice

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
it's worth it or not I didn't notice

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.420 
it's worth it or not I didn't notice
anything<00:03:34.730> for<00:03:35.120> myself

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
anything for myself

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.759 
anything for myself
