refrigeration grade foam insulation so

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.680 
refrigeration grade foam insulation so
that's<00:00:49.579> going<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.789> keep<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.090> contents<00:00:50.449> nice

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
that's going to keep the contents nice

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.689 
that's going to keep the contents nice
and<00:00:50.929> cool<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.620> once<00:00:51.800> that's<00:00:51.920> cool<00:00:52.219> in<00:00:52.399> there

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
and cool so once that's cool in there

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.979

your compressors not having a run as

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.660 
your compressors not having a run as
often<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:54.620> again<00:00:54.890> we're<00:00:55.039> not<00:00:55.129> using<00:00:55.339> as<00:00:55.519> much

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
often so again we're not using as much

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.970 
often so again we're not using as much
power<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:57.379> unit<00:00:57.679> is<00:00:57.800> 880<00:00:58.519> long<00:00:59.149> by<00:00:59.989> 500<00:01:00.800> wide

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
power the unit is 880 long by 500 wide

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.390 
power the unit is 880 long by 500 wide
by<00:01:01.489> about<00:01:01.640> 535<00:01:02.539> high<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.289> it<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.710> big<00:01:04.040> unit

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
by about 535 high so it is a big unit

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.430 
by about 535 high so it is a big unit
does<00:01:04.580> take<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:05.000> quite<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.330> bit<00:01:05.480> of<00:01:05.540> area<00:01:05.690> so<00:01:06.170> it

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
does take up quite a bit of area so it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.069 
does take up quite a bit of area so it
is<00:01:06.590> ideal<00:01:06.980> for<00:01:07.010> full<00:01:07.369> drives<00:01:07.729> trucks<00:01:08.180> caravans
