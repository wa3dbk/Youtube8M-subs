00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
overwhelmed it is in the right
hemisphere<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.080> our<00:01:16.290> brain<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
hemisphere of our brain that is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
hemisphere of our brain that is
activated<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.990> needs<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> calm<00:01:19.710> down

the<00:01:20.570> right<00:01:21.570> hemisphere<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the right hemisphere as you know is the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200 
the right hemisphere as you know is the
emotional<00:01:24.479> part<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.110> our<00:01:25.229> brain<00:01:25.850> when<00:01:26.850> we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
emotional part of our brain when we

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
emotional part of our brain when we
activate<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.020> left<00:01:28.320> hemisphere<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.920> our

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
activate the left hemisphere of our

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
activate the left hemisphere of our
brain<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> logical<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
brain which is the logical and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.340 
brain which is the logical and
organizational<00:01:31.530> part<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> brain<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
organizational part of the brain it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
organizational part of the brain it
sounds<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.799> making<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> shopping

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
sounds just like making the shopping

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
sounds just like making the shopping
list<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.689> talked<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.049> before<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
list that we talked about before in the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520 
list that we talked about before in the
last<00:01:37.950> module<00:01:38.720> we<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.960> many<00:01:40.110> things<00:01:40.380> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
last module we have so many things in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
last module we have so many things in
our<00:01:40.619> heads<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.000> takes<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
our heads then it just takes the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.260 
our heads then it just takes the
pressure<00:01:42.689> off<00:01:43.079> ourselves<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:44.369> organize<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
pressure off ourselves to organize it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.030 
pressure off ourselves to organize it
down<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> use<00:01:45.810> our<00:01:45.899> logical<00:01:46.500> mind<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.860> makes

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
down and use our logical mind just makes

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
down and use our logical mind just makes
us<00:01:47.189> feel<00:01:47.399> better<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.210> course<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.630> makes

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
us feel better and of course it makes

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.929 
us feel better and of course it makes
the<00:01:49.710> process<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.250> we're<00:01:50.490> trying<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> achieve

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the process that we're trying to achieve

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
the process that we're trying to achieve
much<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:51.899> effective<00:01:52.740> putting<00:01:53.040> things<00:01:53.250> down

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
much more effective putting things down

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.330 
much more effective putting things down
on<00:01:53.759> paper<00:01:53.850> where<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> organize<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
on paper where we can see it organize it
