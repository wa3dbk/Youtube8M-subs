00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Let's do the following, let's show. 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 some pictures now say it out loud 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.000
 or just by the thought if you saw a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.000
 weapon a different object from a weapon 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.220
 as you think was most of the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.230
 people doing this kind of task 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.119
 easier to confuse the drill with 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.460
 revolver just before the drill 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.230
 opinion is displayed quickly face 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.850
 of a black person but when the face 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.770
 of a white person presented before 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.600
 the drill people confuse well 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.460
 less the drill with a revolver 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.660
 if you think that a revolver in the two 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.820
 last time we showed the pictures 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.079
 You made that same mistake. 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.760
 this is a task that was to use a 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.760
 research to study prejudice 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.340
 i 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.070
 a dramatic case can help us 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 understand what lies behind this 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 assignment 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 in 1999 a young black immigrant named 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.510
 Amadou diallo lived in the United States. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.369
 I was at the door of his house at night. 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 when he was approached by four policemen 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.690
 a frightened vehicle with the approach 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 beloved took his wallet out of his pocket but 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.360
 soon after that he was hit by 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 19 shots 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 the 41 shots with the police fired 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 against him they mistook portfolio 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.619
 armed with a gun as well as many 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.390
 people confuse a drill with a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.110
 the task we did at the beginning of the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.119
 video 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.680
 before I talk more about prejudice 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.149
 let's understand a little better about the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.190
 behind him 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.560
 one of the most basic spontaneous things 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.300
 what our mind does is categorize it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.380
 occurs because the brain does not 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.539
 process all information 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.920
 available in an environment and therefore 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.350
 he usually uses shortcuts when it comes to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.600
 process information categorize things 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.070
 save our time our attention and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.289
 makes you more prepared to deal with 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.759
 changes in the environment but categorize 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.110
 can also lead us to errors 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.360
 especially when we are 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.190
 categorizing are people we 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 we do it all the time without 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.170
 realize categorizing people 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 different groups such as women 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.259
 Japanese Americans or Rockers 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.209
 these groups are different examples of 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.100
 which we call stereotype psychology 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.570
 the stereotype what we believe 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.010
 the people who are part of the 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.079
 of a particular group 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.459
 already the prejudice the affective evaluation that 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.900
 we have on the group 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.850
 prejudice has to do with how many 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.470
 in general do you like the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.360
 members of a group you may be 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.769
 aware of this prejudice and even 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.630
 try to convince others to feel the 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.549
 even though you feel for a group more 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 not all prejudice is like that too 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.090
 what we call the psychology of 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 Implicit prejudice is an 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.630
 that we have a group but we do not 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.880
 we are necessarily aware of it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.470
 nevertheless the implicit bias can 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.440
 in prejudicially to take g 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.329
 others even in more subtle ways 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.130
 revealed for example in a study 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.500
 people who had racial prejudice 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.239
 implicitly were less sympathetic and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.920
 communicative when interacted with the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.750
 black both stereotypes against 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.459
 preconceptions can lead a person to 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.140
 discriminate against someone discrimination 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.730
 occurs when one or more people are 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 treated in a different way because they are 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.239
 perceived as part of a group and this 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.190
 differential treatment can either 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.560
 disadvantage when favoring the person 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 the radical example of this was 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.070
 racial segregation by establishing 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.030
 apartheid which prevailed as a 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.000
 politics in south africa 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.680
 until the 1990s recognize that people 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.390
 automatically categorize both 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.670
 chairs how much people is not the same 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.950
 that validate or agree with this fact 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.870
 denying that assistance does not solve the problem 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.520
 No matter how bad it is to recognize this 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.110
 violence the disadvantage of 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.000
 any person for the mere fact of it 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.319
 be perceived with part of a group is 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.810
 something we do not want in a society 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.760
 democracy since one day someone can 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.110
 wanting to act with you for thinking that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.830
 You are part of the group that she does not 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.600
 likes 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.069
 knowledge about prejudice can 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.530
 help us not only understand the aspects 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.000
 most basic of our social mind that 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.130
 influences several of our interactions 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.480
 with others on a daily basis but also 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.700
 can help us lessen prejudice 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.440
 or at least the impact on behavior 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.330
 of people 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.130
 What do you think of people who enjoy it? 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.780
 share our videos if you 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.310
 never did this leave the prejudice of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.170
 side and between this group you too 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.920
