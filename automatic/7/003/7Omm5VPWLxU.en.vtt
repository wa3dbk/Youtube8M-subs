00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and this puzzled a lot of people it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
and this puzzled a lot of people it
really<00:01:16.560> did<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.479> granted<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
really did and granted I don't know that

this is a hundred percent true but it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.429 
this is a hundred percent true but it
makes<00:01:20.820> logical<00:01:21.150> sense<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> think

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
makes logical sense if you want to think

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.870 
makes logical sense if you want to think
of<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> terms<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.220> previous<00:01:23.640> Call<00:01:23.850> of

in the actual storyline itself well you

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.179 
in the actual storyline itself well you
might<00:04:35.659> have<00:04:35.810> missed<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.289> update<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:37.009> the

actual picture the etched outnumbering

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.330 
actual picture the etched outnumbering
there<00:04:39.979> is<00:04:40.129> now<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.370> DOT<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.300> period<00:04:42.199> in<00:04:42.379> between<00:04:42.439> 1

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
there is now a DOT a period in between 1

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.499 
there is now a DOT a period in between 1
83<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.330> 84<00:04:45.259> this<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:46.009> now<00:04:46.159> perfectly<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
83 and 84 this is now perfectly the

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.110 
83 and 84 this is now perfectly the
atomic<00:04:47.960> mass<00:04:48.229> of<00:04:48.439> the<00:04:49.009> element<00:04:49.039> tungsten<00:04:49.939> and

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
atomic mass of the element tungsten and

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.119 
atomic mass of the element tungsten and
now<00:04:50.389> where<00:04:50.599> does<00:04:50.719> this<00:04:50.900> come<00:04:50.960> into<00:04:51.289> play<00:04:51.650> well

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
now where does this come into play well

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.700 
now where does this come into play well
in<00:04:52.159> my<00:04:52.460> theory<00:04:52.909> I'm<00:04:53.810> gonna<00:04:54.020> say<00:04:54.379> that<00:04:54.530> this

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
in my theory I'm gonna say that this

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.070 
in my theory I'm gonna say that this
militia<00:04:55.159> that's<00:04:55.430> uprising<00:04:56.150> these<00:04:56.330> group<00:04:56.870> of

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
either as the protagonist or the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.619 
either as the protagonist or the
antagonists<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.610> have<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.210> feeling<00:05:02.599> that

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
antagonists I have a feeling that

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.990 
antagonists I have a feeling that
they're<00:05:02.930> going<00:05:03.169> to<00:05:03.409> be<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:03.800> after<00:05:04.159> tungsten

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
they're going to be going after tungsten

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.450 
they're going to be going after tungsten

of protective heavy-duty ballistics like
that<00:05:14.419> they<00:05:14.930> are<00:05:15.139> used<00:05:15.379> to<00:05:15.560> pierce<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.069> and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
that they are used to pierce that and

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.040 
that they are used to pierce that and
get<00:05:16.490> through<00:05:16.729> it<00:05:16.819> and<00:05:17.000> penetrate<00:05:17.509> and<00:05:17.719> kill

get through it and penetrate and kill
realistically<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.159> makes<00:05:19.460> sense<00:05:19.759> because

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
realistically this makes sense because

so<00:05:32.779> that<00:05:33.229> is<00:05:33.409> my<00:05:33.560> theory<00:05:33.979> an<00:05:34.279> uprising<00:05:35.120> in

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
so that is my theory an uprising in

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.930 
so that is my theory an uprising in
