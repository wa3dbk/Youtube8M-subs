00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 people i am offline again 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to the tuesday video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.080
 and nice that you switched back on 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 has this time from my eyes I'm 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 only one tank job in hamburg and me 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.509
 had recently in the comments 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 read where csu shown it but once 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.170
 video where you are, so to speak the whole 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.490
 in the first day that's okay 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 Now just film like me the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.180
 all day he can somehow up 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 not so charming now I think 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 That's why I remembered where on Sunday 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.599
 My fridge is empty because I have nothing 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.010
 I had more to eat and thought I would 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 but still you know on low carb 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.130
 more protein and so on are sometimes 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.540
 tanke 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.160
 because so we look what can you do 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.200
 now cook on the fast and make 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 so I have no desire to be ok 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 then I do the fish sandwich 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.450
 seen the turkey breast in the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.700
 Freezer compartment is located and the Dutch 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 crisis shows you once so briefly 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.870
 that's the turkey's breast once 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 actually have sandwich on sunday 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.649
 I took a tuna sandwich 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.940
 but unfortunately this is now in salami 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.809
 sandwich because they had nothing 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.399
 other dar 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 that's why it just turns on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 tuna sandwich and here this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 horny dutch cheese kind of is like that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650
 cool tastes really good as well 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 as you see everything sacred 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.460
 and not quite as many carbohydrates too 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 Now just follow it is easy 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.130
 open up the whole here gives customers 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.080
 breast open then of course this one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 beautiful people pebble yes then the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 people if you have to improvise or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.700
 you're on the highway for a long time 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.380
 that's why it can be so sour 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 eat a bit, then take it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 I even have a sandwich ds4 already 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.740
 cheese on it as I said I always take 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 that sandwich is also active because of im 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.829
 Sweat from the tuna 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 That too is not really much on 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.020
 the gas stations sandwich so two 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.890
 slices then then either have their 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.909
 knife here 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.680
 pocketknife comes so everything here 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.180
 stake 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 Of course hope that is not even one 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.100
 you just cut it that way I do 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.950
 Now I book here on the whole coalition 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 I'm a bit modest 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.210
 So we have a sandwich with 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.979
 the cheese and meat so and the next 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680
 thick sandwich so and so looks the whole 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.509
 if you are driving with 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520
 home has nothing left is weird though 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.890
 main thing is my protein content 20 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.450
 gram in acute 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.490
 because of course, in any case 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.020
 that in the cheese trees in the Dutch before 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.370
 Everything a modest one has more 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.810
 But he has to do that now 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.550
 of course, access 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.959
 now you've seen me like this when 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.280
 I do not have it at home then 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.870
 The refrigerator is empty online 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 on the way is yes you can stay for a long time 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.720
 Motorway rides can also be such a 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.490
 trick a little bit what can you do 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.380
 get at the gas station so I do 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.000
 eg with the sandwich of the turkey sausage 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.580
 and the cheese that's how it stays 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.459
 protein content imam stars an but does 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.870
 this tension and if you like the video 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.400
 has fallen a thumbs up and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.020
 partly on facebook and write me once 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.970
 in the comments how he tricked around so 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.530
 if the fridge is empty or you 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.900
 Somehow on the way there is still there 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.640
 other business or variation tells 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.900
 how it is so private after getting excited 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 What you are sorry to write you then 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.989
 I would say we see each other 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.989
 thursday video v3 scan fax 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:17.630
 do you think you are suddenly or two ? 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.110
 days since again something for the tv turned but 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.110
 I may
