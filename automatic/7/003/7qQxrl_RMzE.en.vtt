 you had time to search 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 Keep in mind if you are 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.620
 suddenly arrive somewhere peak season without 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.789
 armor 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.250
 then you will need good luck to 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.440
 find at least something 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.780
 62 well before coming to Thailand well 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 explore areas of the city or beaches of the island 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 where are you going to stay 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.200
 the better you will focus on it 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.830
 the sooner you will understand which area 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.400
 where to live and it will ease your quest step 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.140
 3 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.690
 rent some money 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.870
 movement a few days just go 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.630
 around town or awn to 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.840
 eggs and understand where are you anymore 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 like step 4 looking for my dear 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.430
 move out of the main road to enter 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.860
 in all corners call in the mountains 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 asking for information weight sometimes can not 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 prompt 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.860
 very good options step 5 with 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.770
 conclude a contract be prepared for that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.590
 what will ask you to leave a deposit for one 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.080
 or two months another nuance 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.150
 This method does not work when searching for housing 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.190
 in Bangkok it is very difficult to find 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.990
 some apartments and even more so about 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.310
 volume for a period of less than 6 months 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 [music] 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.420
 cost of electricity water internet 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 and other utilities 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.070
 they may differ dramatically in different 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.920
 places the presence of the very Internet of his 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.920
 The quality of the matter is that if on 10 houses 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.820
 one router and your house is from this 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.429
 router itself 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.759
 at a different distance then good luck with watching 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.250
 this video 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.629
 but seriously and the internet is for you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.640
 really vital 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.409
 then you can specify the landlord 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.680
 the possibility of a dedicated line 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:23.680
 straight into what but consider contract 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.140
 depending on the chosen plan you 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.069
 have to pay immediately for a year not 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.980
 forget to clarify 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.959
 whether cleaning and changing linen and others 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.959
 similar services for rent if 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.690
 Of course maybe it's mold yes yes 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.819
 exactly not to hear when viewed from home 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.780
 look in closets look in dark 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.519
 places and sniff it move times with 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.239
 which I was tortured to fight in our 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.690
 the first house 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.780
 I forgot Rome closet there is a new thought 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.250
 early he jelly green 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.280
 air conditioning and other household appliances 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.959
 such as kettle rice cooker microwave 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.569
 ask about the presence of all these 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.849
 items before signing the contract 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.819
 because your how is it that your neighbor 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.030
 will be 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.010
 and the question why the Thai logic but you 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.349
 same did not ask pay attention that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.659
 most homes lack a bathroom 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.719
 how are you used to washing machine and 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.719
 flew directly with the oven but 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:24.379
 if you find houses in which will 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:26.269
 bathroom on the body here at least in the territory 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.819
 Your home will be washing machine 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.799
 as well as a stove with an oven instead of the usual 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.379
 these gases are small tiles 1 either 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.629
 comfortable nyoma you are lucky 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.299
 just take don't even think 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.030
 and last but most importantly on my 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.560
 look your english level 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.989
 because if you can't 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.909
 can not agree on the price but all 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.730
 important questions that I've been here for so long 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:54.049
 Now spoke and the most important thing is not 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.980
 you can understand the answer very well then 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.530
 and counting or better and loud associations but 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.239
 right in the case you decide but in this 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.530
 case I recommend to contact all such 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.720
 real estate agents 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.830
 I know a few companies here and a son 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.930
 I leave them in the description under this video 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.790
