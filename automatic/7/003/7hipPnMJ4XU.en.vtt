serious<00:00:25.590> topic<00:00:25.980> i'm<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.640> cover<00:00:27.330> because

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
serious topic i'm going to cover because

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
serious topic i'm going to cover because
it's<00:00:27.840> something<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.320> defined<00:00:28.890> my

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
it's something that defined my

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.310 
it's something that defined my
generation<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:31.260> moment

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
generation I think it's at that moment

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
generation I think it's at that moment
that<00:00:31.710> defines<00:00:31.830> every<00:00:32.520> generation<00:00:32.969> for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that defines every generation for

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810 
that defines every generation for
instance<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.130> generation<00:00:35.130> before<00:00:35.160> mine<00:00:35.640> my

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
instance the generation before mine my

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.990 
instance the generation before mine my
family's<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> Vietnam<00:00:37.110> War<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
family's I think the Vietnam War and the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
family's I think the Vietnam War and the
civil<00:00:39.000> rights<00:00:39.210> movements<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
civil rights movements and all the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560 
civil rights movements and all the
hippies<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:42.149> define

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
hippies and all of that that define

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049 
hippies and all of that that define
their<00:00:42.780> generation<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
their generation I think the the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
their generation I think the the
generation<00:00:45.840> before<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.289> my<00:00:46.500> father's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
generation before that my father's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.520 
generation before that my father's
father<00:00:47.160> would<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.730> World<00:00:47.969> War<00:00:48.120> two<00:00:48.450> he<00:00:49.200> served

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
father would be World War two he served

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.549 
father would be World War two he served
in<00:00:49.649> World<00:00:49.829> War<00:00:49.920> two<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.199> each

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
in World War two and it's you know each

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
in World War two and it's you know each
each<00:00:53.010> generation<00:00:53.520> has<00:00:53.670> something<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
each generation has something that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.549 
each generation has something that
defines<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:56.629> 911<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.379> what

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
defines it and for now 911 will be what

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.459 
defines it and for now 911 will be what
defined<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.219> generation<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.230> always<00:01:01.230> will

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
defined my generation I always will

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.650 
defined my generation I always will
remember<00:01:01.500> where<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.670> 911<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.300> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
remember where I was on 911 because as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320 
remember where I was on 911 because as
you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.280> slowly<00:01:05.700> becoming

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you can see it's slowly becoming

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
you can see it's slowly becoming
something<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.520> younger

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
something that the the people younger

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.060 
something that the the people younger
than<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.659> gonna<00:01:09.900> remember<00:01:10.799> i'm

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
than you are not gonna remember i'm

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
than you are not gonna remember i'm
probably<00:01:11.400> I'd<00:01:12.210> say<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.720> last<00:01:13.080> generation

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
probably I'd say the last generation

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310 
probably I'd say the last generation
that<00:01:14.070> would<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:14.369> remember<00:01:15.119> where<00:01:16.110> they

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that would actually remember where they

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.370 
that would actually remember where they
were<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.650> 911<00:01:17.340> cuz<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:18.450> memory<00:01:18.750> becomes<00:01:19.110> kind

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760 
were on 911 cuz your memory becomes kind
of<00:01:19.470> vague<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> blank<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.770> as

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.499 
you get older and older and you know
when<00:01:26.189> you're<00:01:26.310> younger<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.939> don't<00:01:27.330> remember

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.670 
hard to think that because America you
think<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.830> country<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.900> has<00:03:53.900> okay<00:03:54.410> so<00:03:54.470> I

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
think is the country I has okay so I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.310 
think is the country I has okay so I
know<00:03:54.830> this<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.160> going<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.370> be<00:03:55.519> a<00:03:55.730> little<00:03:56.420> biased

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
know this is going to be a little biased

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.949 
know this is going to be a little biased
but<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:57.890> think<00:03:57.980> it's<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.690> superpower<00:03:59.690> it's

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
but I think it's a superpower it's

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.160 
but I think it's a superpower it's
unbelievable<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.610> think<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:02.170> when

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
unbelievable and I think that when

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.870 
unbelievable and I think that when
people<00:04:03.200> think<00:04:03.680> about<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:04.160> people<00:04:04.310> are<00:04:04.670> kind<00:04:04.820> of

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
people think about it people are kind of

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.780 
people think about it people are kind of
shocked<00:04:05.180> because<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.370> don't<00:04:07.549> think

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
shocked because you you you don't think

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.360 
shocked because you you you don't think
a<00:04:07.940> superpower<00:04:08.750> like<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.080> could<00:04:09.260> just<00:04:09.410> be<00:04:09.530> so

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
a superpower like this could just be so

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.069 
a superpower like this could just be so
brutally<00:04:11.200> attacked<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.480> shook<00:04:14.930> our
