00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
looking this is a skill I developed

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
looking this is a skill I developed
while<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.270> was<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.629> college<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.350> wanted<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
while I was in college and I wanted to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.030 
while I was in college and I wanted to
get<00:00:08.420> something<00:00:09.420> good<00:00:09.809> while<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> had<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.380> read<00:00:10.769> a

get something good while I had to read a
ton<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.580> books<00:00:11.990> so<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.170> first<00:00:13.380> thing<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:14.130> want

ton of books so the first thing you want
to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.880> want<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.120> work<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> knitting

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
to do if you want to work on a knitting

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.660 
to do if you want to work on a knitting
project<00:00:16.170> without<00:00:16.560> looking<00:00:17.100> at<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> too<00:00:17.460> much

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
project without looking at it too much

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
project without looking at it too much
it's<00:00:17.990> established<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.199> stitch<00:00:19.410> pattern

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it's established the stitch pattern

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.550 
it's established the stitch pattern
right<00:00:20.189> now<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:20.460> working<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:21.380> some<00:00:22.380> plain

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
right now I'm working on some plain

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.990 
right now I'm working on some plain
stockinette<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.430> definitely<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
stockinette which is definitely the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.390 
stockinette which is definitely the
easiest<00:00:24.109> stitch<00:00:25.109> pattern<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.740> practice<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
easiest stitch pattern to practice the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269 
easiest stitch pattern to practice the
skill<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:27.170> but<00:00:28.170> earlier<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.890> doing<00:00:29.130> some

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
skill on but earlier I was doing some

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.939 
skill on but earlier I was doing some
one<00:00:29.369> by<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.730> rib<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.260> before<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.769> really

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
one by one rib and before I can really

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
one by one rib and before I can really
work<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.430> without<00:00:32.610> looking<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
work on this without looking at it I

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150 
work on this without looking at it I
needed<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.840> work<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.260> couple<00:00:34.440> rows<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
needed to work a couple rows of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.709 
needed to work a couple rows of
stockinette<00:00:35.370> while<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> could<00:00:36.390> pay<00:00:36.510> more

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
stockinette while I could pay more

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.319 
stockinette while I could pay more
attention<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:37.290> project<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> reason

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
attention to my project and the reason

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.250 
attention to my project and the reason
for<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.910> first<00:00:41.910> established<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.930> rhythm

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
for this is first established the rhythm

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
for this is first established the rhythm
of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> stitch<00:00:43.860> pattern<00:00:44.480> not<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.690> important

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
of the stitch pattern not as important

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.940 
of the stitch pattern not as important
for<00:00:46.440> stockinette<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:48.170> for<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.410> by<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.710> rib

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
for stockinette but for one by one rib

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
for stockinette but for one by one rib
it<00:00:50.100> has<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.700> back<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.809> forth<00:00:51.989> rhythm<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it has a very back and forth rhythm to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.850 
it has a very back and forth rhythm to
it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
it
and<00:00:55.129> there's<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> tendency<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.300> revert<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and there's like a tendency to revert to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
and there's like a tendency to revert to
the<00:00:57.899> rhythm<00:00:58.350> before<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.309> you're<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.609> paying

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the rhythm before if you're not paying

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.700 
the rhythm before if you're not paying
close<00:00:59.969> attention<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.289> doing

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
close attention to what you're doing

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.570 
close attention to what you're doing
so<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> wanted<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> practice<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> new<00:01:04.049> rhythm

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
so I wanted to practice the new rhythm

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
so I wanted to practice the new rhythm
and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:06.060> wanted<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:07.619> couple

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and I also wanted to get a good couple

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.520 
and I also wanted to get a good couple
of<00:01:08.400> rows<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.500> left<00:01:11.070> thumb<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> this

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
of rows so my left thumb which is this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.609 
of rows so my left thumb which is this
finger<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> used<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.280> feel<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.820> knitting<00:01:15.060> with

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
finger I used to feel my knitting with

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
finger I used to feel my knitting with
has<00:01:16.619> some<00:01:17.100> stockinette<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.759> feel<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.750> kind

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
has some stockinette to feel so it kind

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.310 
has some stockinette to feel so it kind
of<00:01:19.110> knows<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.680> doing<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:22.110> knit

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of knows what I'm doing and the knit

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
of knows what I'm doing and the knit
stitches<00:01:22.790> have<00:01:23.790> their<00:01:24.240> own<00:01:24.420> feeling<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.619> do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
stitches have their own feeling as do

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770 
stitches have their own feeling as do
the<00:01:26.430> purl<00:01:26.640> stitches<00:01:26.970> purl<00:01:27.479> stitches

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the purl stitches purl stitches

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.399 
the purl stitches purl stitches
obviously<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.650> Ridge<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:30.409> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
obviously have this Ridge here and the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
obviously have this Ridge here and the
texture<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.340> rougher<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> purl<00:01:33.600> side<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
texture is rougher on the purl side so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.819 
texture is rougher on the purl side so
you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.170> tell<00:01:34.320> you're<00:01:34.470> supposed<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> be

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you can tell you're supposed to be

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
you can tell you're supposed to be
purling<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.150> sit<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.680> purl<00:01:38.579> riches

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
purling they also sit the purl riches

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.230 
purling they also sit the purl riches
are<00:01:39.500> angled<00:01:40.500> higher<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:41.670> needle

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
are angled higher on your needle

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
are angled higher on your needle
slightly<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.290> fabric<00:01:43.710> sits<00:01:44.040> closer<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
slightly so your fabric sits closer to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.080 
slightly so your fabric sits closer to
you<00:01:44.880> whereas<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> knit<00:01:46.110> stitches<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:47.090> angled

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you whereas the knit stitches are angled

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
you whereas the knit stitches are angled
away<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.380> you're<00:01:49.530> holding<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
away from you when you're holding it and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.210 
away from you when you're holding it and
working<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> curves<00:01:52.770> under

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
working on it so it kind of curves under

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.219 
working on it so it kind of curves under
your<00:01:53.670> needle<00:01:54.000> away<00:01:54.360> from<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:54.930> whereas

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
your needle away from you more whereas

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
your needle away from you more whereas
the<00:01:55.470> purl<00:01:55.740> wants<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.790> come<00:01:56.969> over<00:01:57.119> your

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the purl wants to kind of come over your

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
the purl wants to kind of come over your

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it with your thumb it's a little

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090 
it with your thumb it's a little
challenging<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> describe<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.530> feeling<00:02:04.920> of

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.800 
and
and<00:02:10.320> really<00:02:10.740> feel<00:02:11.640> what<00:02:11.670> they<00:02:12.120> feel<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.540> and

and really feel what they feel like and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.590 
and really feel what they feel like and
as<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.620> knit<00:02:14.130> you're<00:02:14.910> getting<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.210> insert

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
as you knit you're getting to insert

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.130 
as you knit you're getting to insert
your<00:02:16.110> needle<00:02:16.560> through<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.460> stitch<00:02:17.820> and

your needle through a stitch and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.180 
your needle through a stitch and
sometimes<00:02:19.140> you're<00:02:19.410> gonna<00:02:19.500> catch<00:02:19.890> two

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
sometimes you're gonna catch two

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.410 
sometimes you're gonna catch two
stitches<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> give<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.330> extra

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
little pull with your right working

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.960 
little pull with your right working
needle<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.530> make<00:02:25.680> sure<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.130> just<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.640> stitch

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
needle to make sure it's just one stitch

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.110 
needle to make sure it's just one stitch
it's<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:28.380> unnatural<00:02:28.830> at<00:02:29.250> first<00:02:29.580> but

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
it's a little unnatural at first but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
it's a little unnatural at first but
when<00:02:30.300> you're<00:02:30.450> not<00:02:30.570> looking<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.260> becomes<00:02:31.680> habit

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
when you're not looking it becomes habit

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
when you're not looking it becomes habit
because<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:32.850> how<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.060> know<00:02:33.300> how<00:02:33.600> many

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
because that's how you know how many

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.770 
because that's how you know how many
stitches<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.690> should

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
stitches you have there so you should

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.980 
stitches you have there so you should
really<00:02:37.110> start<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> simple<00:02:37.920> project<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
really start with a simple project and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.680 
really start with a simple project and
practice<00:02:40.580> forcing<00:02:41.580> yourself<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.360> look<00:02:42.510> at

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
practice forcing yourself not to look at

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.990 
practice forcing yourself not to look at
it<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.950> good<00:02:44.700> way<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.880> do<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:47.580> read<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it and a good way to do it is to read a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.479 
it and a good way to do it is to read a
book<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:49.320> can't<00:02:49.590> really<00:02:49.800> look<00:02:50.220> at

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
book because you can't really look at

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.040 
book because you can't really look at
your<00:02:50.670> knitting<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.209> read<00:02:51.390> at<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> same<00:02:51.660> time

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
and as you work on it you want to check

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.380 
and as you work on it you want to check
your<00:02:55.830> work<00:02:55.980> often<00:02:56.250> when<00:02:56.970> you're<00:02:57.090> reading<00:02:57.209> a

textures<00:03:11.880> ribbing<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.020> little<00:03:13.170> more

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
textures ribbing is a little more

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.770 
textures ribbing is a little more
challenging<00:03:13.770> because<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.549> feel<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
challenging because you have to feel the

panel<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> trick<00:03:27.209> doing<00:03:27.570> those<00:03:27.780> it's

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
panel and the trick doing those it's

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520 
panel and the trick doing those it's
just<00:03:28.799> he's<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> lot<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.459> markers<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> hat

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
just he's a lot of markers so for a hat

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.979 
just he's a lot of markers so for a hat
I<00:03:31.860> would<00:03:32.340> put<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> marker<00:03:33.030> for<00:03:33.269> every<00:03:33.690> single

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
I would put a marker for every single

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.800 
I would put a marker for every single
decrease<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:34.980> hat<00:03:35.280> what<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.269> would<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.630> do

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
decrease on the hat what I would just do

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.470 
decrease on the hat what I would just do
is<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.110> would<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.410> feel<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:38.100> my<00:03:38.310> thumb<00:03:38.610> how

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
is I would like feel with my thumb how

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.940 
is I would like feel with my thumb how
many<00:03:39.660> stitches<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.230> before<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> marker

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
many stitches I have before the marker

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.150 
many stitches I have before the marker
and<00:03:41.280> that's<00:03:41.790> how<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.000> keep<00:03:42.180> track<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:43.130> when<00:03:44.130> I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
and that's how I keep track of when I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.340 
and that's how I keep track of when I
need<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.670> work<00:03:44.820> my<00:03:45.060> decreases<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.080> I've<00:03:46.200> also

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
need to work my decreases and I've also

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.890 
need to work my decreases and I've also
done<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.769> for<00:03:47.010> lace<00:03:47.190> patterns<00:03:47.900> panels

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
done that for lace patterns panels

done that for lace patterns panels
they're<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.860> good<00:03:50.130> way<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.519> sort<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.970> let

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
they're a good way to just sort of let

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.660 
they're a good way to just sort of let
your<00:03:52.110> hands<00:03:52.380> know<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:53.100> there's<00:03:53.310> something

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
your hands know that there's something
