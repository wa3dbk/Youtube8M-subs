yet<00:01:01.800> again<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.969> cool<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.359> story<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
yet again very cool little story as you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
yet again very cool little story as you
can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> no<00:01:05.400> face<00:01:05.909> print<00:01:06.330> under

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
can see there is no face print under

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
can see there is no face print under
here<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> mainly<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.430> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
here and that is mainly because you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
here and that is mainly because you
could<00:01:09.240> either<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> girl<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> boy<00:01:10.770> during

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
could either be a girl or a boy during

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
could either be a girl or a boy during
the<00:01:11.729> game<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> course<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.110> want

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the game so of course they do not want

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.710 
the game so of course they do not want
to<00:01:13.729> choose<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:16.130> gender<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.509> but<00:01:18.509> very

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
to choose which gender you are but very

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
to choose which gender you are but very
nice<00:01:18.900> print<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> front<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.830> comes<00:01:20.100> with

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
nice print on the front there comes with

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
nice print on the front there comes with
the<00:01:20.340> black<00:01:20.520> cape<00:01:22.520> there<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.729> no<00:01:24.030> printing<00:01:24.360> on

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the black cape there is no printing on

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
the black cape there is no printing on
the<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.869> mainly<00:01:25.710> because<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.130> cape<00:01:26.520> will

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the back mainly because the cape will

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
the back mainly because the cape will
cover<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:28.890> nicely

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
cover it up but it is very nicely

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
cover it up but it is very nicely
detailed<00:01:29.759> figure<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> pants<00:01:31.079> all

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
detailed figure going from the pants all

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
detailed figure going from the pants all
the<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> face<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.880> only<00:01:33.119> thing

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the way up to the face the only thing

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
the way up to the face the only thing
that's<00:01:33.450> unfortunate<00:01:34.049> about<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.530> figure<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that's unfortunate about this figure is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's unfortunate about this figure is
that<00:01:35.040> many<00:01:35.549> people<00:01:35.729> may<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.420> who<00:01:36.600> he<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that many people may not know who he is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800 
that many people may not know who he is
and<00:01:37.700> since<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> extended

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and since it's from the extended

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
and since it's from the extended
universe<00:01:40.130> style<00:01:41.360> from<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> video<00:01:42.659> games<00:01:43.549> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
universe style from the video games this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.460 
universe style from the video games this
figure<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> doesn't<00:01:45.600> fit<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.079> all

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
figure kind of doesn't fit in with all

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.719 
figure kind of doesn't fit in with all
the<00:01:46.619> other<00:01:46.770> figures<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> they've<00:01:47.460> done<00:01:47.579> in

the other figures that they've done in

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
the other figures that they've done in
the<00:01:47.790> past<00:01:48.259> but<00:01:49.259> still<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.189> nicely<00:01:50.490> done

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the past but still a very nicely done

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.139
