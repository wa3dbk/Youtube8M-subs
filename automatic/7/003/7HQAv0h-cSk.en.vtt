right so this next achievement is cooled
go<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> optics<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> basically<00:02:31.920> all<00:02:31.980> we

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
go for the optics and basically all we

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.590 
go for the optics and basically all we
have<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.640> grab<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.000> laser<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.450> this

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
have to do is to grab this laser in this

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.520 
have to do is to grab this laser in this
machine<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:35.060> stupid<00:02:36.060> watch<00:02:36.239> grab<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.230> it

next achievement it's called frickin

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.750 
next achievement it's called frickin
lasers<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.769> do<00:03:06.099> is<00:03:06.430> using

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
lasers and what you have to do is using

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.330 
lasers and what you have to do is using
laser<00:03:07.239> again<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.920> perform<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
laser again you have to perform the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.720 
laser again you have to perform the
whole<00:03:09.580> surgery<00:03:10.150> just<00:03:10.599> using<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.049> laser<00:03:11.730> it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
whole surgery just using the laser it

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.030 
whole surgery just using the laser it
sounds<00:03:13.150> tough<00:03:13.360> we<00:03:13.810> cut<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.170> because<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.920> is

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
sounds tough we cut it because it is

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.289 
sounds tough we cut it because it is
tough<00:03:15.540> yeah<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:18.220> toughest<00:03:18.730> part<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.090> trying

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
tough yeah the toughest part is trying

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.059 
tough yeah the toughest part is trying
to<00:03:19.420> grab<00:03:19.660> catch<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.319> laser<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.830> course

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
to grab catch the laser of course

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.750 
to grab catch the laser of course
alright<00:03:21.340> there<00:03:21.549> we<00:03:21.579> go

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
alright there we go

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.699 
alright there we go
it's<00:03:22.420> basically<00:03:22.780> yeah<00:03:22.870> all<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.140> got<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.349> do<00:03:23.440> is

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
it's basically yeah all you got to do is

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.979 
it's basically yeah all you got to do is
just<00:03:24.129> cut<00:03:24.519> all<00:03:24.670> these<00:03:24.879> points<00:03:25.510> using<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
just cut all these points using the

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.360 
just cut all these points using the
laser<00:03:30.840> okay<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.049> that's<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.650> large<00:03:32.829> intestine

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
laser okay so that's the large intestine

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.270 
laser okay so that's the large intestine
out<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:35.319> yeah<00:03:35.470> basically<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.890> just<00:03:36.069> have<00:03:36.160> to

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
remove everything that you removed

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.589 
remove everything that you removed
before<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.879> while<00:03:43.030> we're<00:03:43.120> here<00:03:43.150> actually

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
before and while we're here actually

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.000 
before and while we're here actually
this<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:43.989> how<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.230> get<00:03:44.530> another<00:03:44.799> achievement

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
this is how you get another achievement

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.559 
this is how you get another achievement
it's<00:03:45.819> called<00:03:46.180> give<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.629> patient<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.989> scarf<00:03:47.440> and

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
it's called give the patient a scarf and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.059 
it's called give the patient a scarf and
what<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.660> have<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.900> do<00:03:49.989> basically<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.470> just

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
what you have to do basically is just

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.650 
what you have to do basically is just
wrap<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.549> intestine<00:03:52.090> around<00:03:52.299> his<00:03:52.420> neck<00:03:54.660> yeah

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
wrap the intestine around his neck yeah

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.140 
wrap the intestine around his neck yeah
but<00:03:56.379> I<00:03:56.410> I've<00:03:56.920> obviously<00:03:57.129> got<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.640> already<00:03:57.819> but

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
but I I've obviously got it already but

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.759 
but I I've obviously got it already but
that's<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.780> gist<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.349> just<00:03:59.560> wrap<00:03:59.739> it

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
that's the gist of it you just wrap it

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.300 
that's the gist of it you just wrap it
around<00:03:59.950> his<00:04:00.130> neck<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.829> then<00:04:02.829> you<00:04:03.069> get<00:04:03.190> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
around his neck and then you get the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.750 
around his neck and then you get the
achievement<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.859> then<00:04:06.069> you<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.549> have<00:04:06.669> to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
achievement and then you just have to

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.229 
achievement and then you just have to
cut<00:04:06.970> again<00:04:07.269> oil<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.959> pieces<00:04:08.349> are<00:04:08.730> okay<00:04:09.730> that's

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
cut again oil the pieces are okay that's

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:18.170 
cut again oil the pieces are okay that's
that<00:04:10.480> out<00:04:12.720> let's<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:13.780> grab<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.230> intestines

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.370 

from<00:04:19.180> out<00:04:19.360> you<00:04:19.720> don't<00:04:19.840> need<00:04:19.960> that<00:04:20.140> mate

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.440 

meanwhile<00:04:23.380> that's<00:04:23.590> late<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.580> lasers<00:04:25.060> just

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
meanwhile that's late the lasers just

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:40.700 
meanwhile that's late the lasers just
dancing<00:04:25.870> around<00:04:25.930> just<00:04:26.290> causing<00:04:26.710> mayhem

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.429 

so<00:04:41.400> that's<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:41.820> out

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.540 
I immediately regret this decision
basically<00:05:12.970> what<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.420> have<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.600> do<00:05:13.750> is<00:05:14.550> stab

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
basically what you have to do is stab

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.980 
basically what you have to do is stab
yourself<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.150> needle<00:05:16.450> surgeries<00:05:16.870> will

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
yourself with the needle surgeries will

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.340 
yourself with the needle surgeries will
funky<00:05:17.320> like<00:05:17.440> we<00:05:17.590> did<00:05:17.710> last<00:05:17.830> time<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.280> then<00:05:19.350> get

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
funky like we did last time and then get

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.030 
funky like we did last time and then get
electrocuted

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
electrocuted

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.160 
electrocuted
so<00:05:21.880> basically<00:05:22.120> stab<00:05:22.600> ourselves<00:05:22.750> on<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
so basically stab ourselves on the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.090 
so basically stab ourselves on the
needle<00:05:23.380> first

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
needle first

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.120 
needle first
that's<00:05:24.370> one<00:05:24.610> here<00:05:25.620> there<00:05:26.620> we<00:05:26.710> go

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
that's one here there we go

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.650 
that's one here there we go
we're<00:05:27.610> stabbed<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.230> then<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:30.450> pick<00:05:31.450> up<00:05:31.540> a

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
we're stabbed and then you pick up a

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.730 
we're stabbed and then you pick up a
scalpel<00:05:35.880> if<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:37.060> can<00:05:37.300> it's<00:05:38.200> a<00:05:38.260> lot<00:05:38.380> harder<00:05:38.530> to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
scalpel if you can it's a lot harder to

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.070 
scalpel if you can it's a lot harder to
see<00:05:38.920> things<00:05:39.130> in<00:05:39.370> this<00:05:39.840> sort<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.900> way<00:05:42.930> all<00:05:43.930> right

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
see things in this sort of way all right

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.970 
see things in this sort of way all right
so<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.710> know<00:05:44.830> we<00:05:45.190> haven't<00:05:45.370> got<00:05:45.460> one<00:05:45.490> yet<00:05:46.980> all

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
so you know we haven't got one yet all

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.680 
so you know we haven't got one yet all
right<00:05:50.790> okay<00:05:51.790> right<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.000> you<00:05:52.210> got<00:05:52.330> a<00:05:52.360> scalpel

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
right okay right so you got a scalpel

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.020 
right okay right so you got a scalpel
and<00:05:52.720> what<00:05:53.260> is<00:05:53.440> there's<00:05:53.890> a<00:05:53.950> electrical<00:05:54.730> socket

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
and what is there's a electrical socket

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.880 
and what is there's a electrical socket
just<00:05:55.210> behind<00:05:55.420> the<00:05:55.540> clock<00:05:55.750> on<00:05:56.020> this<00:05:56.230> left<00:05:56.710> hand

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
just behind the clock on this left hand

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.790 
just behind the clock on this left hand
side<00:05:57.100> and<00:05:57.280> all<00:05:58.030> you<00:05:58.180> have<00:05:58.270> to<00:05:58.390> do<00:05:58.450> is<00:05:58.570> just<00:05:58.810> tap

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
side and all you have to do is just tap

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.100 
side and all you have to do is just tap
it<00:06:00.010> with<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.220> scalpel<00:06:00.670> and<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.960> are

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
it with the scalpel and you are

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.220 
it with the scalpel and you are
electrocuted<00:06:03.480> so<00:06:04.480> basically<00:06:04.840> what<00:06:05.080> the

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
electrocuted so basically what the

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.290 
electrocuted so basically what the
electric<00:06:05.650> shock<00:06:06.280> does<00:06:06.520> to<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:06.790> is<00:06:07.030> it

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
electric shock does to you is it

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.470 
electric shock does to you is it
reverses<00:06:07.780> all<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:07.990> controls<00:06:08.350> on<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.590> mouse

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
reverses all the controls on the mouse

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.780 
reverses all the controls on the mouse
so<00:06:10.480> down<00:06:11.050> is<00:06:11.230> up<00:06:11.350> and<00:06:11.620> up<00:06:11.740> is<00:06:11.860> down<00:06:12.070> left<00:06:12.610> is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
so down is up and up is down left is

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.170 
so down is up and up is down left is
right<00:06:12.940> and<00:06:13.210> vice<00:06:13.630> versa<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:15.100> that's<00:06:15.790> been<00:06:16.060> the

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
right and vice versa and that's been the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.870 
right and vice versa and that's been the
last<00:06:16.330> achievement<00:06:16.870> for<00:06:16.990> this<00:06:17.080> video<00:06:17.340> so<00:06:18.340> if

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880
