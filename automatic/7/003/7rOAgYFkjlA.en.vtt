00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
the circuit with about 12 volts in

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.529 
the circuit with about 12 volts in
forget<00:06:07.310> about<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:07.520> minus<00:06:07.940> sign<00:06:07.970> is<00:06:08.300> at<00:06:08.450> the

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
forget about that minus sign is at the

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.239 
forget about that minus sign is at the
lease<00:06:08.690> reverse

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:09.249 
lease reverse

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:13.889 
lease reverse
and<00:06:09.599> getting<00:06:10.599> about<00:06:10.749> 10.5<00:06:11.439> amps<00:06:11.859> out<00:06:12.869> when<00:06:13.869> I

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:13.899 
and getting about 10.5 amps out when I

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.249 
and getting about 10.5 amps out when I
got<00:06:14.169> back<00:06:14.439> I<00:06:15.119> actually<00:06:16.119> sold<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:16.689> Rodin<00:06:16.959> coil

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
got back I actually sold the Rodin coil

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.259 
got back I actually sold the Rodin coil
and<00:06:17.529> the<00:06:17.679> power<00:06:17.859> rod<00:06:18.129> off<00:06:18.399> the<00:06:18.639> board<00:06:18.879> so<00:06:19.089> I<00:06:19.149> had

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:19.269 
and the power rod off the board so I had

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:21.359 
and the power rod off the board so I had
a<00:06:19.299> wine<00:06:19.569> and<00:06:19.989> add<00:06:20.169> a<00:06:20.199> nut<00:06:20.499> coil<00:06:20.739> back<00:06:20.919> in<00:06:21.189> there

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:21.369 
a wine and add a nut coil back in there

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.359 
a wine and add a nut coil back in there
to<00:06:21.849> get<00:06:22.029> testing<00:06:22.509> against<00:06:22.719> I<00:06:22.839> wanted<00:06:23.109> to<00:06:23.169> see

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:23.369 
to get testing against I wanted to see

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.279 
to get testing against I wanted to see
how<00:06:24.369> much<00:06:24.579> better<00:06:24.819> the<00:06:25.089> MOSFET<00:06:25.599> I<00:06:25.809> was<00:06:26.049> using

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
how much better the MOSFET I was using

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.439 
how much better the MOSFET I was using
was<00:06:26.589> Jack<00:06:26.889> so<00:06:27.129> again<00:06:27.429> this<00:06:27.909> is<00:06:28.089> the<00:06:28.119> jacks

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
was Jack so again this is the jacks

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.989 
was Jack so again this is the jacks
we're<00:06:28.659> looking<00:06:28.869> at<00:06:28.959> four<00:06:29.169> amps<00:06:29.469> drawn<00:06:30.039> 10.3

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:30.999 
we're looking at four amps drawn 10.3

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:35.429 
we're looking at four amps drawn 10.3
amps<00:06:31.829> created<00:06:32.829> in<00:06:32.979> the<00:06:33.099> power<00:06:33.609> rod<00:06:33.879> and<00:06:34.439> here

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:35.439 
amps created in the power rod and here

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:37.439 
amps created in the power rod and here
it<00:06:35.619> is<00:06:35.739> one<00:06:35.919> point<00:06:36.129> eight<00:06:36.309> 8<00:06:36.879> nine<00:06:36.939> volts

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
it is one point eight 8 nine volts

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.959 
it is one point eight 8 nine volts
across<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:38.579> starship<00:06:39.579> load<00:06:40.079> and<00:06:41.819> here<00:06:42.819> in<00:06:42.879> a

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:42.969 
across the starship load and here in a

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.959 
across the starship load and here in a
minute<00:06:43.119> we<00:06:43.329> all<00:06:43.479> have<00:06:43.659> the<00:06:43.899> now<00:06:44.559> we're<00:06:45.069> by<00:06:45.759> just

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
minute we all have the now we're by just

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.459 
minute we all have the now we're by just
changing<00:06:46.149> the<00:06:46.329> MOSFET<00:06:46.749> not<00:06:46.959> change<00:06:47.229> anything

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:47.469 
changing the MOSFET not change anything

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.619 
changing the MOSFET not change anything
else<00:06:47.709> we're<00:06:48.009> drawing<00:06:48.249> 4.1<00:06:49.029> amps<00:06:49.329> but<00:06:49.449> now<00:06:49.569> we

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
else we're drawing 4.1 amps but now we

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.709 
else we're drawing 4.1 amps but now we
have<00:06:49.769> 15.4<00:06:50.789> quite<00:06:51.789> an<00:06:51.909> increase<00:06:52.239> their<00:06:52.479> about

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:52.719 
have 15.4 quite an increase their about

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.839 
have 15.4 quite an increase their about
5am<00:06:53.409> so<00:06:53.529> and<00:06:53.889> there<00:06:54.039> you<00:06:54.099> can<00:06:54.159> see<00:06:54.249> the<00:06:54.519> correct

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
5am so and there you can see the correct

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.519 
5am so and there you can see the correct
mosfet<00:06:55.659> mounted<00:06:56.110> on<00:06:56.259> the<00:06:56.489> heatsink<00:06:57.489> and<00:06:58.529> let's

00:06:59.519 --> 00:06:59.529 
mosfet mounted on the heatsink and let's

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.079 
mosfet mounted on the heatsink and let's
see<00:06:59.709> here<00:07:00.069> is<00:07:00.219> so<00:07:00.549> much<00:07:00.699> to<00:07:00.879> say<00:07:01.059> and

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089 
see here is so much to say and

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.799 
see here is so much to say and
everything<00:07:02.159> anyway<00:07:03.159> this<00:07:03.309> is<00:07:03.459> now<00:07:03.610> my<00:07:03.809> audio

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:04.809 
everything anyway this is now my audio

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.809 
everything anyway this is now my audio
video<00:07:05.019> studio<00:07:05.379> has<00:07:05.619> become<00:07:05.889> my<00:07:06.099> starship

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819 
video studio has become my starship

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.469 
video studio has become my starship
studio<00:07:07.419> and<00:07:08.699> the<00:07:09.699> little<00:07:10.089> thing<00:07:10.239> you<00:07:10.329> see

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
studio and the little thing you see

studio and the little thing you see
there<00:07:10.629> in<00:07:10.749> frame<00:07:11.019> has<00:07:11.229> a<00:07:11.259> long<00:07:11.559> story<00:07:12.129> has<00:07:12.879> to

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:13.029 
there in frame has a long story has to

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:15.179 
there in frame has a long story has to
do<00:07:13.179> with<00:07:13.329> the<00:07:13.449> Phoenix<00:07:13.779> lights<00:07:13.869> long<00:07:14.499> story
