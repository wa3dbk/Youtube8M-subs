helper muscles they perform multiple
different<00:00:21.810> joint<00:00:22.230> actions<00:00:22.739> and<00:00:22.919> so<00:00:23.009> therefore

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
different joint actions and so therefore

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.760 
different joint actions and so therefore
can<00:00:23.610> make<00:00:23.759> the<00:00:23.880> technique<00:00:24.329> on<00:00:24.989> this<00:00:25.290> machine

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
can make the technique on this machine

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.190 
can make the technique on this machine
quite<00:00:26.279> challenging<00:00:26.669> so<00:00:28.399> the<00:00:29.399> setup<00:00:29.640> points<00:00:30.200> on

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
quite challenging so the setup points on

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.080 
quite challenging so the setup points on
this<00:00:31.649> because<00:00:31.950> it's<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.220> system<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this because it's the system we have a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.270 
this because it's the system we have a
platform<00:00:33.469> kneeling<00:00:34.469> platform<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.160> can

mistake<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:29.239> know<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:29.959> called<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.230> chin<00:02:30.470> up

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
mistake is I know it's called a chin up

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.979 
mistake is I know it's called a chin up
but<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.519> really<00:02:31.819> taking<00:02:32.209> your<00:02:32.300> eyes<00:02:32.510> up<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
but it's really taking your eyes up to

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.350 
but it's really taking your eyes up to
the<00:02:33.019> level<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> bar<00:02:33.760> some<00:02:34.760> people<00:02:35.060> still

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the level of the bar some people still

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.690 
the level of the bar some people still
try<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.630> pull<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.080> chin<00:02:36.410> all<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.709> way<00:02:37.190> up<00:02:37.459> to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
try to pull the chin all the way up to

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.750 
try to pull the chin all the way up to
that<00:02:37.819> top<00:02:38.120> range<00:02:39.069> for<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.130> shoulder<00:02:40.489> remains

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
that top range for the shoulder remains

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.190 
that top range for the shoulder remains
stable<00:02:41.180> up<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.690> point

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
stable up at that point

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.259 
stable up at that point
it's<00:02:42.410> really<00:02:42.769> challenging<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.970> take<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
it's really challenging to just take the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.860 
it's really challenging to just take the
eyes<00:02:44.450> up<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.930> level<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.890> hands<00:02:46.870> you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
eyes up to the level of the hands you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.140 
eyes up to the level of the hands you
will<00:02:47.959> also<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.950> there's<00:02:49.910> multiple

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
will also see that there's multiple

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.970 
will also see that there's multiple
different<00:02:50.600> handle<00:02:51.200> positions<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.829> we've

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
different handle positions that we've

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.520 
different handle positions that we've
got<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.519> can<00:02:52.549> use<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.150> here<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:54.320> wide

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
got that we can use on here the wide

got that we can use on here the wide
position<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.519> use<00:02:55.850> produces<00:02:56.450> an

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
position that we just use produces an

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.940 
position that we just use produces an
action<00:02:56.900> called<00:02:57.079> adduction<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.739> really

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
action called adduction and really

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.390 
action called adduction and really
focuses<00:02:58.549> into<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> lats<00:02:59.650> we've<00:03:00.650> got<00:03:00.920> the

focuses into the lats we've got the
front<00:03:01.640> handle<00:03:02.000> positions<00:03:02.540> here<00:03:02.930> where<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.620> can

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
front handle positions here where we can

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.910 
front handle positions here where we can

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.610 
the platform
once<00:03:11.329> again<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.810> squeeze<00:03:12.079> your<00:03:12.170> shoulders

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
once again we squeeze your shoulders

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.259 
once again we squeeze your shoulders
down<00:03:12.799> out<00:03:13.070> of<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.250> ears<00:03:13.519> as<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:13.940> pull<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
down out of the ears as we pull the

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.470 
down out of the ears as we pull the
elbows<00:03:14.630> down<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.290> towards<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.250> ribs<00:03:16.519> eyes

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
elbows down in towards the ribs eyes

control back down you'll see that the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.840 
control back down you'll see that the
action<00:03:23.570> on<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.640> changes<00:03:25.640> quite

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
action on this changes quite

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.490 
action on this changes quite
significantly<00:03:26.690> because<00:03:27.049> we're<00:03:27.230> staying

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
significantly because we're staying

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.949 
significantly because we're staying
forward<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.489> engages<00:03:29.030> more<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.480> bicep

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
forward it engages more of the bicep

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.680 
forward it engages more of the bicep
into<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> action<00:03:30.799> we<00:03:31.549> go<00:03:31.700> into<00:03:31.910> rotating<00:03:32.600> the

then take

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.370 
then take
the<00:03:42.580> platform<00:03:43.060> away<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.660> just<00:03:44.170> do<00:03:44.350> a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
the platform away and just do a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.330 
the platform away and just do a
bodyweight<00:03:44.920> chena<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:47.470> balance<00:03:47.860> out<00:03:48.070> this
