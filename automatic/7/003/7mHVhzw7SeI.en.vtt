00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.010
 Sergey Avramenko 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 we are on the project anti kettle two networks 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.509
 internet may swan dot com 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.240
 I want to present you a mini course about 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.100
 microsoft windows 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.770
 studio 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.620
 in this part let's talk about working with 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.779
 sound track but first all the same 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:34.320
 talk about time see that the whole 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.739
 video has a duration of a minute and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.620
 10 seconds to calculate this time is pretty 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.340
 easy we have 10 slides and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.050
 duration display duration 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.769
 each one is 7 seconds 7 by 10 70 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.839
 seconds it will be just ten minutes 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.460
 let's find out how long our song lasts 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.729
 for this right click property 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.220
 more 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.339
 and here is our sound duration 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.210
 tracks in this case will be two minutes and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.870
 three seconds 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 clearly not enough and not enough 50 seconds 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's add the sound go to home 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 add music choose our music 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:39.719
 file and look like as it will be 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 sound and all sharp break sound 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:46.609
 when is the time of the show 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.159
 slide last slide 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.539
 to end the video along with 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.700
 soundtrack at the same time 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.240
 the first option is to increase the time 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.600
 view each photo for this 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.289
 let's select all the photos from 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.759
 of the previous lesson you know what it is 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.880
 can be done with the shift key 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.540
 select the first hold shift on 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.530
 the keyboard and the last one stands out all 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 our 10 consecutive photos 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.930
 go to the edit tab and set 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.930
 here 12 and a half seconds 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.490
 but I will tell you in confidence let's run 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.740
 12 seconds to watch the slide is very 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.260
 a lot and your film will seem third-party 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.560
 the observer is quite tedious and not 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.170
 interesting so let's use the second 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.400
 way we cancel our actions 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.680
 second way to add some more 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.570
 photos 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.270
 bookmark main add photo 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.140
 8 more photos 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.240
 why 87 and 856 to block we know 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.860
 that we have 50 seconds and got enough 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.900
 56 and here we clearly see that our melody 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.530
 ends just somewhere in the middle 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.550
 last layer principle is good 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.520
 up to this point we talked more 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.640
 time than the sounds and doing 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.690
 math and now let's just 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.310
 let's talk about working with sound in the program 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.030
 film studio as soon as we click 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.760
 highlight our sound track appears 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.560
 bookmark tools for working with music 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.480
 and the parameters are here 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.870
 audio tools 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.370
 track let's remove your photos 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.190
 which we added 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.940
 select them all with the shift key and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.390
 for all eight click david 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.630
 your task is to end 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.030
 roller 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.810
 the sound did not stop abruptly but gradually 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.419
 faded away so we can on the parameters panel 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.120
 select tool extinction speed 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.030
 open the drop-down list and select 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.600
 low 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.600
 Let's check 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:44.660
 the song is not over but the sound came off 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.070
 no and it looks pretty good 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.560
 music tools 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.970
 allow us to do a lot of interesting things 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.370
 for example put some songs 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.300
 some kind of sound compositions but for 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.430
 that we need to cut off unnecessary let's say 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.550
 so for example 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:10.919
 set our marker at this point 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.930
 scroll and choose a command 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:21.030
 split the right side select by clicking and 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.639
 delete now we can insert into it 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.680
 place another melody third possible under 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.440
 each of the slides to pick your 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.330
 sound design let's move on 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.849
 time on the sound track and see more 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.240
 we can accurately set the start time 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.340
 end point accurate to tenth 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.349
 seconds 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.789
 many interesting things you can do everything 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.240
 depends on your imagination 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:51.560
 and on this i want to finish this lesson 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.560
 see you next
