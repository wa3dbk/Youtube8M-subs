 I have been able to adjust it more comfortably, 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.879
 If you pay for the price / performance ratio, there is no one to follow. 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.100

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.030
 I will 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.930
 If you use the on-pin, if you have a multi-pen when you wear a little lens 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.360
 It's the same thing.

 It really moves at 1 inch per 8 minutes Meet 1/4 inch 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:44.100

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.610
 If the breadth of the bread is horizontal and the true shape is large, the adjustment is the same. 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.660

 Now, where I is released can be adjusted closer tha ball 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.770
 Anyway, I think it's the most reasonable sights I've ever used.

 So it's great at times. 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:12.330
 As an expensive expensive 260,000 won cotton is wrapped in one of
