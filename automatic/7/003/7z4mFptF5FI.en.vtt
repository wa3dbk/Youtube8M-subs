here's a shot of the back of the box in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.800 
here's a shot of the back of the box in
case<00:00:37.579> you're<00:00:37.760> wondering<00:00:37.880> what<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.480> back<00:00:38.630> of

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
case you're wondering what the back of

case you're wondering what the back of
the<00:00:38.900> box<00:00:39.050> happens<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.650> look<00:00:39.770> like<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.579> Stratos

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
the box happens to look like the Stratos

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.580 
the box happens to look like the Stratos
itself<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> bit<00:00:41.810> smaller<00:00:42.140> than<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.470> might

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
itself is a bit smaller than you might

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.500 
itself is a bit smaller than you might
imagine<00:00:42.739> which<00:00:43.310> I<00:00:43.550> guess<00:00:43.760> would<00:00:44.000> be<00:00:44.030> because

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
imagine which I guess would be because

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.810 
imagine which I guess would be because
this<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.079> made<00:00:45.440> for<00:00:45.470> portable<00:00:46.010> devices<00:00:46.310> so<00:00:46.730> you

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
this is made for portable devices so you

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.400 
this is made for portable devices so you
would<00:00:46.940> want<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:47.270> controller<00:00:47.630> itself<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.290> be

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
would want the controller itself to be

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.710 
would want the controller itself to be
portable<00:00:48.649> as<00:00:49.010> well<00:00:49.280> here's<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.210> shot<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.480> the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
portable as well here's a shot of the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.810 
portable as well here's a shot of the
top<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.170> controller<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:51.739> have<00:00:51.890> your<00:00:52.070> l1

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
top of the controller you have your l1

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.319 
top of the controller you have your l1
r1<00:00:53.149> l2<00:00:53.750> r<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.620> trigger<00:00:55.220> buttons<00:00:55.610> much<00:00:56.000> like<00:00:56.210> you

r1 l2 r to trigger buttons much like you

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.850 
r1 l2 r to trigger buttons much like you
would<00:00:56.360> find<00:00:56.630> on<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.870> PlayStation<00:00:57.470> controller

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
would find on a PlayStation controller

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.370 
would find on a PlayStation controller
in<00:00:58.100> fact<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.000> actual<00:00:59.329> button<00:00:59.600> layout<00:00:59.930> very

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
in fact the actual button layout very

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.350 
in fact the actual button layout very
much<00:01:00.620> mimics<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:01.250> PlayStation<00:01:02.030> controller

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
much mimics a PlayStation controller

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.899 
much mimics a PlayStation controller
which<00:01:03.020> I've<00:01:03.380> been<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.860> PlayStation<00:01:04.460> user<00:01:04.640> for

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
which I've been a PlayStation user for

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.690 
which I've been a PlayStation user for
many<00:01:05.059> years<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.570> my<00:01:06.110> gamepad<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:06.740> my<00:01:06.950> pc<00:01:07.310> uses

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
many years and my gamepad for my pc uses

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.730 
many years and my gamepad for my pc uses
a<00:01:07.729> similar<00:01:08.120> layout<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.020> all<00:01:09.200> of<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:09.409> is<00:01:09.470> nice

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
a similar layout so all of this is nice

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.890 
a similar layout so all of this is nice
to<00:01:09.770> see<00:01:09.950> at<00:01:10.220> least<00:01:10.340> for<00:01:10.580> me<00:01:10.729> here's<00:01:11.570> what<00:01:11.780> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
to see at least for me here's what the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.360 
to see at least for me here's what the
bottom<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.350> controller<00:01:12.740> looks<00:01:12.950> like<00:01:13.220> you

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
bottom of the controller looks like you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.520 
bottom of the controller looks like you
just<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.760> micro<00:01:14.210> USB<00:01:14.690> port<00:01:14.720> which<00:01:15.049> is<00:01:15.320> used

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
just have a micro USB port which is used

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.560 
just have a micro USB port which is used
for<00:01:15.740> charging<00:01:15.799> on<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.000> back<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.420> unit

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
for charging on the back of the unit

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.719 
for charging on the back of the unit
there's<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.960> button<00:01:18.409> that's<00:01:18.770> used<00:01:19.070> for<00:01:19.190> pairing

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
there's a button that's used for pairing

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.730 
there's a button that's used for pairing
with<00:01:19.880> bluetooth<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.140> right<00:01:21.320> side<00:01:21.560> that

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
with bluetooth on the right side that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.649 
with bluetooth on the right side that
you<00:01:21.830> saw<00:01:22.010> earlier<00:01:22.190> there<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.880> power<00:01:23.420> switch

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
you saw earlier there is a power switch

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.930 
you saw earlier there is a power switch
so<00:01:24.650> now<00:01:24.799> it's<00:01:24.950> time<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.250> get<00:01:25.340> into<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.700> meat<00:01:25.880> of

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
so now it's time to get into the meat of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.700 
so now it's time to get into the meat of
the<00:01:26.210> review<00:01:26.540> which<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:26.960> how<00:01:27.320> well<00:01:27.560> this

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
the review which is how well this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.370 
the review which is how well this
particular<00:01:27.920> controller<00:01:28.640> works<00:01:29.330> with<00:01:29.600> iOS<00:01:29.810> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
particular controller works with iOS and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.510 
particular controller works with iOS and
the<00:01:30.560> games<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.890> are<00:01:31.040> supported<00:01:31.490> with

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the games that are supported with

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.210 
the games that are supported with
controllers<00:01:32.330> but<00:01:33.049> first<00:01:33.320> device

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
controllers but first device

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.460 
controllers but first device
compatibility<00:01:34.570> Apple<00:01:35.570> actually<00:01:35.990> limits<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
compatibility Apple actually limits the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.170 
compatibility Apple actually limits the
compatibility<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.159> Bluetooth<00:01:37.580> controllers

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
compatibility of Bluetooth controllers

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.700 
compatibility of Bluetooth controllers
so<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:38.750> would<00:01:38.900> have<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.260> upgrade<00:01:39.470> to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
so that you would have to upgrade to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.280 
so that you would have to upgrade to
newer<00:01:40.040> devices<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.299> for<00:01:41.540> example<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:42.020> tried

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
newer devices so for example I tried

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.320 
newer devices so for example I tried
this<00:01:42.439> with<00:01:42.590> my<00:01:42.770> ipad<00:01:43.189> 2<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.700> unfortunately

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
this with my ipad 2 and unfortunately

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.450 
this with my ipad 2 and unfortunately
while<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.140> would<00:01:45.350> connect<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.040> controller

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
while it would connect to the controller

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.789 
while it would connect to the controller
it<00:01:47.360> wouldn't<00:01:47.720> work<00:01:47.840> with<00:01:48.049> games<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.470> after

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
it wouldn't work with games and after

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.100 
it wouldn't work with games and after
maybe<00:01:49.580> 30<00:01:49.880> seconds<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.390> being<00:01:50.479> connected<00:01:50.810> it

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
maybe 30 seconds of being connected it

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.230 
maybe 30 seconds of being connected it
would<00:01:51.229> say<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:51.680> it's<00:01:51.860> not<00:01:51.979> compatible<00:01:52.939> with

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
would say that it's not compatible with

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.080 
would say that it's not compatible with
the<00:01:53.420> iPad<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.979> only<00:01:55.130> devices<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.970> is

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
the iPad so the only devices this is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.780 
the iPad so the only devices this is
compatible<00:01:56.659> with<00:01:56.689> is<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.320> iphone<00:01:57.470> 5s<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.340> 5c

you<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.600> get<00:02:32.900> used<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.410> very<00:02:33.710> quickly<00:02:34.010> I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
you can get used to this very quickly I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.280 
you can get used to this very quickly I
imagine<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.270> might<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.510> more<00:02:35.660> difficult<00:02:35.720> with

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
imagine it might be more difficult with

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.620 
imagine it might be more difficult with
people<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:36.800> more<00:02:37.010> larger<00:02:37.430> hands<00:02:37.820> but<00:02:38.300> for<00:02:38.480> me

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
people with more larger hands but for me

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.690 
people with more larger hands but for me
it<00:02:39.020> really<00:02:39.110> did<00:02:39.590> improve<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.400> gaming

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
it really did improve the gaming

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.780 
it really did improve the gaming
experience<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.480> my<00:02:41.690> iPhone<00:02:42.110> 5s<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.830> do<00:02:43.460> have<00:02:43.640> an

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
experience on my iPhone 5s I do have an

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.820 
experience on my iPhone 5s I do have an
ipad<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.090> ipad<00:02:44.300> 2<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.020> unfortunately<00:02:45.620> like<00:02:45.800> i

ipad the ipad 2 but unfortunately like i

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.150 
ipad the ipad 2 but unfortunately like i
said<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.340> does<00:02:46.460> not<00:02:46.580> work<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> for<00:02:48.590> san<00:02:48.740> andreas

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
said it does not work so for san andreas

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.040 
said it does not work so for san andreas
this<00:02:49.520> game<00:02:49.730> works<00:02:50.000> perfectly<00:02:50.720> with<00:02:50.930> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
this game works perfectly with the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.810 
this game works perfectly with the
controller<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.680> utilizes<00:02:51.830> every<00:02:52.610> button

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
controller and it utilizes every button

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820 
controller and it utilizes every button
available<00:02:52.970> including<00:02:53.720> both<00:02:53.900> analog<00:02:54.470> sticks

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
available including both analog sticks

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.830 
available including both analog sticks
and<00:02:55.100> when<00:02:56.090> you're<00:02:56.210> playing<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.480> game<00:02:56.660> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and when you're playing this game it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.480 
and when you're playing this game it
just<00:02:56.870> begs<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.530> used<00:02:57.830> with<00:02:58.040> an<00:02:58.160> external

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
just begs to be used with an external

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.190 
just begs to be used with an external
controller<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.690> probably<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.170> of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
controller so this is probably one of

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.260 
controller so this is probably one of
the<00:03:00.350> best<00:03:00.500> examples<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:01.250> you'll<00:03:01.400> find<00:03:01.670> my

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
the best examples that you'll find my

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.990 
the best examples that you'll find my
next<00:03:02.570> example<00:03:02.990> is<00:03:03.110> with<00:03:03.350> Riptide<00:03:03.890> gp2<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.880> is

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
next example is with Riptide gp2 this is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.760 
next example is with Riptide gp2 this is
one<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.390> earlier<00:03:05.810> games<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.320> supported

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you can continue to use the directional

you can continue to use the directional

not<00:03:21.830> detected<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.520> here<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.240> do<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.510> some

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
not detected and here you do have some

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.449 
not detected and here you do have some
option<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.200> tell<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.560> what<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.890> controls<00:03:25.280> are

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
option to tell you what the controls are

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.370 
option to tell you what the controls are
and<00:03:25.670> things<00:03:25.880> like<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:26.510> that's<00:03:26.660> useful<00:03:27.200> to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
and things like that so that's useful to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.350 
and things like that so that's useful to
check<00:03:27.920> out<00:03:28.100> when<00:03:28.700> you're<00:03:28.820> actually<00:03:28.970> playing

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
check out when you're actually playing

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.940 
check out when you're actually playing
the<00:03:29.510> game<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.900> not<00:03:29.959> failing<00:03:30.290> as<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.650> saw<00:03:30.830> it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
the game and not failing as you saw it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.210 
the game and not failing as you saw it
just<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.580> there<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.630> works<00:03:32.840> pretty<00:03:33.020> well<00:03:33.220> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
just it there it works pretty well the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.650 
just it there it works pretty well the
left<00:03:34.400> analog<00:03:34.580> stick<00:03:34.820> which<00:03:35.240> are<00:03:35.390> using

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
left analog stick which are using

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.510 
left analog stick which are using
constantly<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:36.350> steering<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.950> wish<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.340> was<00:03:37.490> a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
constantly for steering I wish it was a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.090 
constantly for steering I wish it was a
little<00:03:37.640> more<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:39.230> not<00:03:39.410> as<00:03:39.590> stiff<00:03:39.830> I<00:03:39.950> guess

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
little more just not as stiff I guess

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.580 
little more just not as stiff I guess
you<00:03:40.220> could<00:03:40.250> say<00:03:40.550> it's<00:03:40.790> not<00:03:41.510> as<00:03:41.750> easy<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.290> move

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
you could say it's not as easy to move

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.949 
you could say it's not as easy to move
around<00:03:42.709> as<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.250> wish<00:03:43.489> it's<00:03:44.209> not<00:03:44.390> too<00:03:44.570> bad<00:03:44.720> it's

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
around as I wish it's not too bad it's

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.479 
around as I wish it's not too bad it's
still<00:03:45.170> usable<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.890> course<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.220> will<00:03:46.370> get

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
still usable and of course you will get

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.060 
still usable and of course you will get
used<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.820> this<00:03:46.910> fairly<00:03:47.150> quickly<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:48.680> do<00:03:48.830> use

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
used to this fairly quickly you do use

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.270 
used to this fairly quickly you do use
the<00:03:49.459> art<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.180> trigger<00:03:50.690> stick<00:03:51.020> to<00:03:51.320> accelerate

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
the art to trigger stick to accelerate

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.490 
the art to trigger stick to accelerate
or<00:03:52.520> you<00:03:53.090> could<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:53.239> turn<00:03:53.450> auto<00:03:53.900> accelerate

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
or you could just turn auto accelerate

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.010 
or you could just turn auto accelerate
on<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.860> just<00:03:54.950> use<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.430> left<00:03:55.760> analog<00:03:56.030> or

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
on and just use the left analog or

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.960 
on and just use the left analog or
excuse<00:03:57.230> me<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.380> left<00:03:57.680> trigger<00:03:58.040> button<00:03:58.459> for

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
excuse me the left trigger button for

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.330 
excuse me the left trigger button for
breaking<00:03:59.800> this<00:04:00.800> game<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.190> pretty

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
breaking this game is pretty

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.680 
breaking this game is pretty
straightforward<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:02.239> all<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.600> buttons

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
straightforward not all of the buttons

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.449 
straightforward not all of the buttons
are<00:04:02.930> used<00:04:03.110> because<00:04:03.290> there's<00:04:03.860> only<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:04.310> much

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
are used because there's only so much

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.790 
are used because there's only so much
you<00:04:04.670> need<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:05.090> use<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:06.170> works<00:04:06.500> pretty<00:04:06.680> well

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
you need to use and it works pretty well

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.580 
you need to use and it works pretty well
for<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:07.520> particular<00:04:08.000> game<00:04:08.150> I'm<00:04:09.140> not<00:04:09.320> sure<00:04:09.500> if

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
for this particular game I'm not sure if

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.140 
for this particular game I'm not sure if
I<00:04:09.650> would<00:04:09.770> use<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> controller<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.670> would<00:04:10.970> just

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
I would use a controller I would just

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.550 
I would use a controller I would just
rather<00:04:11.270> use<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.720> on-screen<00:04:11.900> buttons<00:04:12.440> for

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
rather use the on-screen buttons for

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.370 
rather use the on-screen buttons for
this<00:04:12.709> particular<00:04:13.220> one<00:04:13.430> but<00:04:14.120> overall<00:04:14.989> it<00:04:15.230> does

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
this particular one but overall it does

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.470 
this particular one but overall it does
work<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.890> does<00:04:16.130> work<00:04:16.310> fairly<00:04:16.640> well<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:17.150> have

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
work and it does work fairly well I have

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.120 
work and it does work fairly well I have
a<00:04:17.540> few<00:04:17.780> more<00:04:17.900> demos<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.380> show<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.830> one<00:04:19.010> is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
a few more demos to show you this one is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.420 
a few more demos to show you this one is
with<00:04:19.280> sonic<00:04:19.730> all-stars<00:04:20.390> racing<00:04:20.630> transformed

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
with sonic all-stars racing transformed

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.650 
with sonic all-stars racing transformed
this<00:04:22.430> one<00:04:22.669> does<00:04:22.880> work<00:04:23.060> with<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.300> controller

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
this one does work with the controller

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.540 
this one does work with the controller
but<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.110> menu<00:04:24.260> system<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.370> doesn't

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
but for the menu system it just doesn't

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.300 
but for the menu system it just doesn't
work<00:04:25.729> so<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.030> have

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
work so you have

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.310 
work so you have
actually<00:04:26.669> tap<00:04:26.910> your<00:04:27.030> screen<00:04:27.389> when<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.169> go

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
actually tap your screen when you go

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.470 
actually tap your screen when you go
under<00:04:28.500> game<00:04:28.800> options<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.460> will<00:04:29.639> detect<00:04:30.060> if<00:04:30.419> you

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
under game options it will detect if you

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.570 
under game options it will detect if you
have<00:04:30.630> an<00:04:30.870> external<00:04:31.290> controller<00:04:31.800> setup<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.460> it

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
have an external controller setup and it

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.010 
have an external controller setup and it
will<00:04:32.700> show<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:32.880> all<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.360> controls<00:04:33.750> there

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
will show you all the controls there

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.930 
will show you all the controls there
when<00:04:34.590> playing<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:35.070> felt<00:04:35.280> as<00:04:35.430> though<00:04:35.610> when

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
when playing I felt as though when

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.850 
when playing I felt as though when
compared<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.360> Riptide<00:04:36.690> GP<00:04:37.169> this<00:04:37.440> game<00:04:37.620> better

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
compared to Riptide GP this game better

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.710 
compared to Riptide GP this game better
benefits<00:04:38.460> from<00:04:38.700> using<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:39.060> controller<00:04:39.419> because

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
benefits from using a controller because

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.420 
benefits from using a controller because
you<00:04:39.930> do<00:04:40.080> have<00:04:40.110> extra<00:04:40.560> buttons<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.190> different

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
you do have extra buttons and different

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.450 
you do have extra buttons and different
things<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.850> do<00:04:42.120> while<00:04:42.540> playing<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.370> for<00:04:44.370> this

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
things to do while playing and for this

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.800 
things to do while playing and for this
one<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:45.060> actually<00:04:45.480> uses<00:04:45.630> the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
one it actually uses the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.110 
one it actually uses the
pressure-sensitive<00:04:46.430> triggers<00:04:47.430> to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
pressure-sensitive triggers to

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.780 
pressure-sensitive triggers to
accelerate<00:04:48.990> based<00:04:49.470> off<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.740> how<00:04:49.980> hard<00:04:50.580> you're

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
accelerate based off of how hard you're

r2 button and I didn't really feel as
though<00:04:56.040> this<00:04:56.220> was<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.700> good<00:04:56.880> idea<00:04:56.940> for<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:58.350> game

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
though this was a good idea for a game

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.080 
though this was a good idea for a game
like<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.710> you're<00:04:59.160> either<00:04:59.310> need<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.639> be<00:04:59.850> on

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
like this you're either need to be on

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.680 
like this you're either need to be on
the<00:05:00.570> accelerator<00:05:01.100> full<00:05:02.100> or<00:05:02.400> not<00:05:03.060> on<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.360> at<00:05:03.479> all

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
the accelerator full or not on it at all

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.540 
the accelerator full or not on it at all
so<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.110> pressure<00:05:04.500> sensitivity<00:05:05.070> for<00:05:05.430> this

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
so the pressure sensitivity for this

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.920 
so the pressure sensitivity for this
particular<00:05:06.060> game<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.389> didn't<00:05:06.810> seem

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
particular game it just didn't seem

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.469 
particular game it just didn't seem
necessary<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.400> had<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.820> push<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.030> little<00:05:09.210> bit

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
necessary so I had to push a little bit

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.510 
necessary so I had to push a little bit
harder<00:05:09.750> than<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.990> wanted<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.380> on<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.979> button<00:05:11.160> to

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
harder than I wanted to on the button to

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.310 
harder than I wanted to on the button to
make<00:05:11.639> sure<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.030> it's<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.479> accelerator<00:05:13.229> is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
make sure that it's the accelerator is

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.430 
make sure that it's the accelerator is
being<00:05:13.650> used<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:14.220> full<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:16.080> can<00:05:16.200> see<00:05:16.290> I'm<00:05:16.380> using

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
being used in full you can see I'm using

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.290 
being used in full you can see I'm using
the<00:05:16.680> left<00:05:16.919> analog<00:05:17.130> stick<00:05:17.370> for<00:05:17.760> steering<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.180> is

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the left analog stick for steering it is

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.300 
the left analog stick for steering it is
pressure<00:05:18.810> sensitive<00:05:18.930> so<00:05:19.560> depending<00:05:20.040> on<00:05:20.040> how

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
pressure sensitive so depending on how

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.430 
pressure sensitive so depending on how
far<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.270> move<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.570> stick<00:05:21.780> over<00:05:22.080> left<00:05:22.290> or

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
far you move the stick over left or

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.930 
far you move the stick over left or
right<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.860> depends<00:05:23.280> on<00:05:23.370> how<00:05:23.490> much<00:05:23.700> your

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
right that depends on how much your

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.450 
right that depends on how much your
carts<00:05:24.479> or<00:05:24.690> vehicle<00:05:25.260> will<00:05:25.410> actually<00:05:25.800> move<00:05:26.040> left

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
carts or vehicle will actually move left

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.580 
carts or vehicle will actually move left
or<00:05:26.639> right<00:05:26.790> so<00:05:26.970> that's<00:05:27.150> nice<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:28.169> video<00:05:28.410> that

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
or right so that's nice the video that

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.930 
or right so that's nice the video that
you're<00:05:28.710> actually<00:05:28.860> seeing<00:05:29.250> now<00:05:29.430> is<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.790> one

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
you're actually seeing now is the one

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.430 
you're actually seeing now is the one

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
Pro Skater two worked perfectly exactly

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.050 
Pro Skater two worked perfectly exactly
as<00:06:16.560> if<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:16.800> was<00:06:16.919> playing<00:06:17.039> it<00:06:17.280> using<00:06:17.669> an<00:06:17.760> actual

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
as if I was playing it using an actual

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.270 
as if I was playing it using an actual
PlayStation<00:06:18.810> controller<00:06:19.139> using<00:06:20.010> an<00:06:20.100> actual

PlayStation controller using an actual

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.550 
PlayStation controller using an actual
PlayStation<00:06:21.150> but<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.810> course<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.200> was<00:06:22.410> using

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
PlayStation but of course I was using

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.000 
PlayStation but of course I was using
this<00:06:22.770> on<00:06:22.979> my<00:06:23.220> iPhone<00:06:23.550> 5s<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:25.350> also<00:06:25.560> tested

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
this on my iPhone 5s and I also tested

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.070 
this on my iPhone 5s and I also tested
this<00:06:26.130> with<00:06:26.340> crash<00:06:26.760> nitro<00:06:27.030> kart<00:06:27.210> or<00:06:27.810> excuse<00:06:28.050> me

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
this with crash nitro kart or excuse me

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.140 
this with crash nitro kart or excuse me
crash<00:06:28.410> team<00:06:28.620> racing<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:29.220> that<00:06:29.669> worked<00:06:29.880> just

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
crash team racing and that worked just

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.180 
crash team racing and that worked just
fine<00:06:30.300> as<00:06:30.600> well<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:31.440> if<00:06:31.530> you<00:06:31.650> are<00:06:31.889> jailbroken

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
fine as well so if you are jailbroken

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.330 
fine as well so if you are jailbroken
this<00:06:32.639> controller<00:06:33.090> is<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.750> little<00:06:34.050> more<00:06:34.340> useful

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
this controller is a little more useful

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.890 
this controller is a little more useful
in<00:06:35.490> terms<00:06:35.640> of<00:06:35.820> value<00:06:35.940> because<00:06:36.390> it<00:06:36.539> just<00:06:36.630> works

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
in terms of value because it just works

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.770 
in terms of value because it just works
with<00:06:37.110> so<00:06:37.470> many<00:06:37.590> more<00:06:37.830> titles

opposed<00:06:59.330> to<00:06:59.510> using<00:06:59.660> the<00:06:59.840> virtual<00:07:00.020> controls<00:07:00.590> on

opposed to using the virtual controls on

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.530 
opposed to using the virtual controls on
your<00:07:00.889> screen<00:07:01.639> because<00:07:01.910> that<00:07:02.060> can<00:07:02.210> use<00:07:02.389> up

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
your screen because that can use up

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.480 
your screen because that can use up
screen<00:07:02.840> space<00:07:03.110> and<00:07:03.380> it<00:07:03.440> just<00:07:03.680> takes<00:07:04.190> away<00:07:04.430> from

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
screen space and it just takes away from

the<00:07:04.639> overall<00:07:05.000> gaming<00:07:05.450> experience<00:07:06.020> for<00:07:07.010> me

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
the overall gaming experience for me

the overall gaming experience for me
with<00:07:07.430> my<00:07:07.550> iPhone<00:07:07.970> it<00:07:08.360> really<00:07:08.840> did<00:07:09.080> help<00:07:09.320> when

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
with my iPhone it really did help when

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.530 
with my iPhone it really did help when
playing<00:07:10.100> games<00:07:10.370> especially<00:07:10.669> driving<00:07:11.180> games

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
playing games especially driving games

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.470 
playing games especially driving games
where<00:07:11.780> you<00:07:11.960> want<00:07:12.200> accurate<00:07:12.770> steering<00:07:13.220> and

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
where you want accurate steering and

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.690 
where you want accurate steering and
acceleration<00:07:14.650> but<00:07:15.650> I<00:07:15.890> imagine<00:07:16.310> this<00:07:16.400> would<00:07:16.550> be

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:16.700 
acceleration but I imagine this would be

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.840 
acceleration but I imagine this would be
much<00:07:17.090> more<00:07:17.380> immersive<00:07:18.380> when<00:07:18.919> using<00:07:19.220> an<00:07:19.400> iPad

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
much more immersive when using an iPad

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.340 
much more immersive when using an iPad
for<00:07:20.060> instance<00:07:20.390> unfortunately<00:07:21.080> I<00:07:21.140> don't<00:07:21.200> have

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
for instance unfortunately I don't have

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.200 
for instance unfortunately I don't have
a<00:07:21.470> newer<00:07:21.650> iPad<00:07:22.070> so<00:07:22.280> I<00:07:22.310> was<00:07:22.490> unable<00:07:22.640> to<00:07:22.790> test

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
a newer iPad so I was unable to test

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.000 
a newer iPad so I was unable to test
that<00:07:23.360> out<00:07:23.419> but<00:07:24.080> I<00:07:24.110> imagine<00:07:24.530> it<00:07:24.620> would<00:07:24.710> just<00:07:24.830> be

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
that out but I imagine it would just be

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.400 
that out but I imagine it would just be
a<00:07:25.040> much<00:07:25.310> better<00:07:25.520> gaming<00:07:26.180> experience<00:07:26.360> using<00:07:27.020> it

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
a much better gaming experience using it

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.620 
a much better gaming experience using it
on<00:07:27.620> an<00:07:27.770> iPad<00:07:28.130> but<00:07:28.370> overall<00:07:28.640> the<00:07:29.240> controller

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
on an iPad but overall the controller

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.150 
on an iPad but overall the controller
itself<00:07:29.900> works<00:07:30.140> fine<00:07:30.410> the<00:07:30.650> battery<00:07:30.950> life<00:07:31.130> is

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 
itself works fine the battery life is

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.590 
itself works fine the battery life is
very<00:07:31.520> long<00:07:31.790> so<00:07:32.000> you<00:07:32.090> don't<00:07:32.240> have<00:07:32.330> to<00:07:32.450> worry

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600 
very long so you don't have to worry

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.110 
very long so you don't have to worry
about<00:07:32.720> charging<00:07:33.020> it<00:07:33.290> too<00:07:33.470> often<00:07:33.800> but<00:07:34.640> that's

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 
about charging it too often but that's

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.610 
about charging it too often but that's
it<00:07:35.360> with<00:07:35.450> my<00:07:35.570> review<00:07:35.900> of<00:07:35.930> the<00:07:36.050> steelseries

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:36.620 
it with my review of the steelseries

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.110 
it with my review of the steelseries
Stratus<00:07:37.040> it's<00:07:37.220> an<00:07:37.340> excellent<00:07:37.639> controller

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
Stratus it's an excellent controller

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.390 
Stratus it's an excellent controller
it's<00:07:38.780> eighty<00:07:39.020> dollar<00:07:39.229> so<00:07:39.500> it's<00:07:39.620> not<00:07:39.770> cheap<00:07:40.100> but

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
it's eighty dollar so it's not cheap but

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.310 
it's eighty dollar so it's not cheap but
that's<00:07:40.700> more<00:07:41.510> of<00:07:41.570> an<00:07:41.660> apple<00:07:41.990> thing<00:07:42.139> than

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320 
that's more of an apple thing than

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.200 
that's more of an apple thing than
anything<00:07:42.680> so<00:07:43.430> that's<00:07:43.550> it<00:07:43.640> with<00:07:43.790> this<00:07:43.880> video<00:07:44.120> if

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.210
