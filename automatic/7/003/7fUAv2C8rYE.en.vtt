00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.020
 Today, where I am sitting, I have over 60 years 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.020
 children 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.730
 60 children worldwide 60 godparents and 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.100
 that is my reward 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.960
 for example when I am at one 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 Saturday morning I went to the baker 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.590
 to bring buns 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.090
 if I basically to the gas station 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.680
 Sundays also basically 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.030
 two piccoloers took two in the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.180
 drunk car then got me on 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.250
 The breakfast table is set fishman 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.460
 room purely without end and then went 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.440
 It felt good to me then this kids will be 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.760
 have no eyes are born are blind 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.770
 but no one deforms whatever 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.250
 they can not help the family 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.250
 the families are poor and that's why 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.260
 these children are thrown into the field 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.370
 like the cat and then me again 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.650
 I woke up to mine 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.360
 girlfriend is perfect she has exactly the same 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.500
 It's perfect if I have one 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.059
 then nothing perfect 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.309
 Suddenly I was back in my life 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.680
 arrived I was the hero offers 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.290
 Gets my life a tragic hero 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.340
 yes this year but at least a stove 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.940
 I somehow had my life back 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.229
 and so, as I said, he was not 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.090
 no effort he has then somehow 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.290
 a minute called and I thought so 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.700
 Okay, that may be nice 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.549

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.259

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.359
 just that it had a plan and 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.240
 that it had a meaning and I know 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.150
 that, too, may be quite esoteric 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.950
 sound 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.450
