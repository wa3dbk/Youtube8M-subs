00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
probably a year or so and I just felt

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.210 
probably a year or so and I just felt
like<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.600> represents<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> record<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.830> terms<00:02:41.010> of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
like it represents a record in terms of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.130 
like it represents a record in terms of
it<00:02:41.670> she<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.270> head<00:02:42.360> over<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.660> 12<00:02:42.959> the

really going playing an everything at

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.560 
really going playing an everything at
the<00:02:52.440> wall<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.100> potentially<00:02:54.000> may<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.390> our

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
the wall and it potentially may be our

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.050 
the wall and it potentially may be our
last<00:02:54.600> really<00:02:55.320> over-the-top<00:02:56.040> records<00:02:56.880> so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
last really over-the-top records so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.400 
last really over-the-top records so
speaking<00:02:57.660> bill<00:02:57.900> i<00:02:57.930> think<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> good

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
speaking bill i think is a good

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.930 
speaking bill i think is a good
representation<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.310> where<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> double

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
representation of where the double

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.150 
representation of where the double
albums<00:03:00.209> going<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.720> would<00:03:00.870> suggest<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.680> in

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
albums going that would suggest that in

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.740 
albums going that would suggest that in
making<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.640> double<00:03:02.910> album<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.390> magnitude

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
making a double album of this magnitude

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.690 
making a double album of this magnitude
in<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.200> ambition<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.070> feel<00:03:05.370> at<00:03:05.520> this

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
in this ambition that you feel at this

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.370 
in this ambition that you feel at this
stage<00:03:06.060> without<00:03:06.390> saying<00:03:06.840> anything<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
stage without saying anything of the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.500 
stage without saying anything of the
future<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:08.459> you've<00:03:08.640> reached<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.150> peak<00:03:09.330> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
future that you've reached a peak in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.530
