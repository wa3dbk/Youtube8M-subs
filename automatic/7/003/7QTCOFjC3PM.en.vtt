the<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.649> information<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:03.359> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the kind of information that really you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
the kind of information that really you
know<00:01:03.899> moves<00:01:04.320> our<00:01:04.680> students<00:01:05.220> along<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
know moves our students along what I

really<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.799> assessments<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
really like about these assessments is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.980 
really like about these assessments is
the<00:01:09.119> way<00:01:09.270> they're<00:01:09.450> asking<00:01:09.960> questions

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the way they're asking questions

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
the way they're asking questions
differently<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:11.640> asking<00:01:12.030> students<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
differently they're asking students to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.830 
differently they're asking students to
demonstrate<00:01:13.470> their<00:01:14.390> mathematical<00:01:15.390> reasoning

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
demonstrate their mathematical reasoning

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
demonstrate their mathematical reasoning
skills<00:01:16.049> they're<00:01:16.409> prompting<00:01:16.920> students<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
skills they're prompting students to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
skills they're prompting students to
make<00:01:17.759> compelling<00:01:18.210> arguments<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.200> are

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
make compelling arguments they are

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
make compelling arguments they are
asking<00:01:20.280> students<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> work<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> diverse

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
asking students to work with a diverse

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.160 
asking students to work with a diverse
set<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.170> texts<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> synthesize<00:01:24.000> those<00:01:24.330> these

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
set of texts and synthesize those these

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
set of texts and synthesize those these
are<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> skills<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.159> students<00:01:26.610> need

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
are all the skills we know students need

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.590 
are all the skills we know students need
in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> real<00:01:27.150> world

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
in the real world

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.319 
in the real world
we<00:01:28.409> haven't<00:01:28.680> been<00:01:28.799> asking<00:01:29.430> students<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> do

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
we haven't been asking students to do

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.980 
we haven't been asking students to do
this<00:01:31.170> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> work<00:01:31.950> before<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.570> there's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this kind of work before so there's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
this kind of work before so there's
gonna<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.380> phase<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.640> which

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
gonna be a phase in there in which

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
gonna be a phase in there in which
they're<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.750> struggle<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they're gonna have to struggle and that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.130 
they're gonna have to struggle and that
is<00:01:37.860> actually<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.729> demonstration<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.990> their

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is actually a demonstration of their

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469 
is actually a demonstration of their
learning<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.590> mean<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.460> learn<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.299> we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
learning I mean we don't learn if we

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
learning I mean we don't learn if we
don't<00:01:42.689> struggle<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.470> also<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> remember

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
don't struggle we also have to remember

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.910 
don't struggle we also have to remember
that<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:45.000> these<00:01:45.540> assessments<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.740> not

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that these these assessments do not

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.910 
that these these assessments do not
entirely<00:01:47.369> define<00:01:47.850> our<00:01:48.060> case

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
entirely define our case

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.710 
entirely define our case
certainly<00:01:49.920> our<00:01:50.040> world<00:01:50.760> is<00:01:50.880> changing<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:51.660> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
certainly our world is changing what I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.060 
certainly our world is changing what I
think<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.200> own<00:01:52.320> students

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
think about my own students

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.180 
think about my own students
you<00:01:53.310> know<00:01:53.400> I'm<00:01:53.550> educating<00:01:54.240> them<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:55.530> careers

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
you know I'm educating them for careers

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.850 
you know I'm educating them for careers
that<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.460> can't<00:01:56.670> even<00:01:56.850> imagine<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.480> so<00:01:57.860> what's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that we can't even imagine and so what's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
that we can't even imagine and so what's
really<00:01:59.180> important<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.560> armed

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
really important is that they are armed

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
really important is that they are armed
when<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.460> leave<00:02:02.730> with<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> set<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> skills

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
when they leave with a set of skills

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.680 
when they leave with a set of skills
that<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.410> be<00:02:04.470> transferable<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.690> any
