on it right now and I'll tell you I the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.570 
on it right now and I'll tell you I the
chassis<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.000> low<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> ground<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:44.130> lot<00:02:44.550> of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
chassis is so low to the ground a lot of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.130 
chassis is so low to the ground a lot of
people<00:02:44.790> take<00:02:45.090> these<00:02:45.239> off<00:02:45.390> road<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.870> they<00:02:45.930> play

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
people take these off road and they play

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.390 
people take these off road and they play
with<00:02:46.320> them<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.560> stuff<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.950> that's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
with them and stuff like that that's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.699 
with them and stuff like that that's
fine<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.940> know<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:48.840> prerogative<00:02:48.989> do

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
fine you know that's your prerogative do

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.460 
fine you know that's your prerogative do
what<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.980> will<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.450> me<00:02:51.450> personally<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.260> think

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
what you will but me personally I think

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.380 
what you will but me personally I think
the<00:02:52.800> chassis<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.190> too<00:02:53.370> low<00:02:53.550> for<00:02:53.580> any<00:02:53.940> off-road

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the chassis is too low for any off-road

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.229 
the chassis is too low for any off-road
play<00:02:54.690> unless<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.260> uh<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:56.130> know<00:02:56.220> hard<00:02:56.670> flat

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
play unless it's uh you know hard flat

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.699 
play unless it's uh you know hard flat
surface<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:59.489> took<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:00.060> stock<00:03:00.720> cars<00:03:01.019> off<00:03:01.350> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
surface so I took the stock cars off and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.740 
surface so I took the stock cars off and
I<00:03:01.769> put<00:03:02.040> foam<00:03:03.769> foam<00:03:04.769> wheels<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.910> they

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I put foam foam wheels on it and they

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.140 
I put foam foam wheels on it and they
grew<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.350> lot<00:03:08.010> better<00:03:08.310> than<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> stock<00:03:08.910> tires

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
grew a lot better than the stock tires

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.199 
grew a lot better than the stock tires
did<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:09.840> thing<00:03:10.110> will<00:03:10.920> hug<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.580> curve<00:03:11.880> man

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
did and this thing will hug a curve man

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.460 
did and this thing will hug a curve man
so<00:03:12.739> now<00:03:14.239> now<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.480> recounts<00:03:15.959> god<00:03:16.140> i'm<00:03:16.350> not

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
doing too much off-roading but this

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.449 
doing too much off-roading but this
thing<00:03:18.959> with<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.260> brushless<00:03:19.500> system<00:03:19.920> hauled

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
thing with the brushless system hauled

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.810 
thing with the brushless system hauled
ass<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.090> i'm<00:03:21.269> very<00:03:21.330> pleased<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.820> I've

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
been doing a lot of high speed runs with

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.020 
been doing a lot of high speed runs with
it<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.709> hopefully<00:03:28.709> I'll<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.640> couple<00:03:29.970> of

difference<00:03:40.049> guys<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:42.060> parts<00:03:42.510> are<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> lot

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
difference guys the parts are a lot

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.740 
difference guys the parts are a lot
cheaper<00:03:42.959> for<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.799> thing<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.910> kit<00:03:45.150> was<00:03:45.450> more

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
cheaper for this thing the kit was more

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.860 
cheaper for this thing the kit was more
expensive<00:03:46.400> but<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.850> get<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.239> pay<00:03:48.360> for

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870

because<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.319> broke<00:04:10.530> one<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.890> other<00:04:11.129> day<00:04:11.159> when<00:04:11.459> I

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
because I broke one the other day when I

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.990 
because I broke one the other day when I
was<00:04:11.609> playing<00:04:13.189> so<00:04:14.189> a<00:04:14.220> lot<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.609> parts<00:04:14.790> are

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
was playing so a lot of the parts are

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.539 
was playing so a lot of the parts are
interchangeable<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:17.220> has<00:04:17.959> oil-filled<00:04:18.959> shocks

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
interchangeable it has oil-filled shocks
