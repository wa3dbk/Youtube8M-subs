00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that he will not forget but when you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640

ball<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.689> fight<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.530> they

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
ball down this fight I don't think they

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
ball down this fight I don't think they
even<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> necessarily<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> rematch

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
even need to necessarily have a rematch

but<00:01:16.080> Floyd<00:01:16.290> Mayweather<00:01:16.740> Jr<00:01:17.159> will<00:01:17.490> probably

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
but Floyd Mayweather Jr will probably

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
but Floyd Mayweather Jr will probably
win<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.509> opinion<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> decision<00:01:19.590> there

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
win in my opinion be a decision there

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
win in my opinion be a decision there
are<00:01:20.369> three<00:01:20.880> different<00:01:21.330> results<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.229> two

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
are three different results I see two

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
are three different results I see two

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
decision somehow Marcos Maidana can

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
decision somehow Marcos Maidana can
manage<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> knock<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.630> Mayweather<00:01:27.920> good<00:01:28.920> luck
