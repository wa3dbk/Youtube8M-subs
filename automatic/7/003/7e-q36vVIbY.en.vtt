ability<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> let<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.920> through<00:01:35.100> walls

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
ability to let you see through walls

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.770 
ability to let you see through walls

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's it right there where that might

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.710 
that's it right there where that might
be<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.200> heat<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.729> sensing<00:01:38.729> sort<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.509> thing

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
be just to heat a sensing sort of thing

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.010 
be just to heat a sensing sort of thing
and<00:01:40.970> there's<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.750> um<00:01:44.750> what<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and there's that there's um what I'm in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
and there's that there's um what I'm in
right<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.770> advanced<00:01:47.250> armor<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
right now that's like advanced armor and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.139 
right now that's like advanced armor and
then<00:01:48.329> there's<00:01:48.479> invisibility<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:51.000> guys

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
then there's invisibility so the guys

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
then there's invisibility so the guys
from<00:01:51.329> Halo<00:01:51.659> Reach<00:01:51.689> might<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
from Halo Reach might be going on as and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.350 
from Halo Reach might be going on as and
visibility<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> campers<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
visibility is going to campers and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
visibility is going to campers and
surprisingly<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.049> only<00:01:55.409> ran<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.189> camper

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
surprisingly I only ran into one camper

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.749 
surprisingly I only ran into one camper
and<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:58.020> entire<00:01:58.170> match<00:01:58.759> everybody's

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and this entire match everybody's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.740 
and this entire match everybody's
running<00:01:59.880> around<00:02:00.149> everybody's<00:02:00.509> having<00:02:00.689> fun

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
running around everybody's having fun

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
running around everybody's having fun
and<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:01.439> probably<00:02:01.590> change<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:02.399> soon<00:02:02.640> as

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and that will probably change as soon as

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340 
and that will probably change as soon as
the<00:02:02.939> full<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.270> comes<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the full game comes out when all the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.690 
the full game comes out when all the
campers<00:02:04.680> find<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.250> fucking<00:02:05.549> hidey

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
warfare 2 i'd say they're probably

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
warfare 2 i'd say they're probably
superior<00:02:36.420> though<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.380> different
