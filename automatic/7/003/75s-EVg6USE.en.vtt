00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:30.210

 secures the line and so on, that is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.670

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:27.290
 fishing from any boat 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:29.340
 I consider an inflatable vessel more than 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.590

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.570

 devices I have never seen 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:17.950
 honestly we fold and close 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:24.450
 we get 25 centimeters only 25 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:28.380
