00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
some pretty cool uses you can choose

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.300 
some pretty cool uses you can choose
which<00:02:45.090> players<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.200> want<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.800> I'm<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.190> gonna

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
go ahead and kill them you you can um

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.050 
go ahead and kill them you you can um

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
attack you can make them friendly I

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.550 
attack you can make them friendly I
honestly<00:02:58.800> can't<00:02:59.100> think<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.400> any<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:01.080> super

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
honestly can't think of any like super

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.500 
honestly can't think of any like super
good<00:03:01.769> uses<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:02.850> sure<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.060> all

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
good uses for it but I'm sure that all

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.810 
good uses for it but I'm sure that all
you<00:03:03.810> super<00:03:04.200> creative<00:03:04.440> people<00:03:04.769> out<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.190> can

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
you super creative people out there can

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.539 
you super creative people out there can
come<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.150> with<00:03:06.180> ideas<00:03:06.870> for<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.620> minigames<00:03:08.190> or

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
come up with ideas for like minigames or

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.120 
come up with ideas for like minigames or
little<00:03:08.790> adventure<00:03:09.090> maps<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.989> it's<00:03:10.170> actually

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
little adventure maps and it's actually

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.000 
little adventure maps and it's actually
it's<00:03:11.519> like<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:12.090> easy<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.989> if<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:13.650> into

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
it's like really easy so if I go into

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.410 
it's like really easy so if I go into
game<00:03:14.459> mode<00:03:14.489> see<00:03:15.410> there<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.269> one

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
game mode see there is it's just one

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.110 
game mode see there is it's just one
command<00:03:18.890> boom<00:03:19.910> right<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:22.080> make<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
command boom right now if you make a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.750 
command boom right now if you make a
hostile<00:03:24.120> mob<00:03:24.420> join<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.500> team<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.400> were<00:03:26.519> in

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
hostile mob join a team that you were in

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.520 
hostile mob join a team that you were in
so<00:03:27.239> if<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.810> go<00:03:27.870> scoreboard<00:03:28.560> teams<00:03:29.480> leave<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.930> just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
so if I go scoreboard teams leave I just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.470 
so if I go scoreboard teams leave I just
left<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.860> team<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.250> was<00:03:32.370> actually<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.180> hub

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
left the team I was actually in this hub

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.449 
left the team I was actually in this hub
team<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.170> that's<00:03:34.560> how<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.769> found<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:35.310> I

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
team and that's how I found it because I

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.910 
team and that's how I found it because I
was<00:03:35.610> mucking<00:03:35.850> around<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.049> teams<00:03:37.620> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
was mucking around with the teams and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.900 
was mucking around with the teams and
stuff<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:39.269> accidentally<00:03:39.870> set<00:03:40.320> @e<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.700> join

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
stuff and I accidentally set @e to join

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.110 
stuff and I accidentally set @e to join
the<00:03:42.150> team<00:03:42.959> instead<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.549> noticed<00:03:44.910> that

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the team instead of a and I noticed that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.690 
the team instead of a and I noticed that
the<00:03:45.299> mobs<00:03:45.540> weren't<00:03:45.930> attacking<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.459> then<00:03:47.670> I

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the mobs weren't attacking and so then I

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.240 
the mobs weren't attacking and so then I
looked<00:03:47.970> into<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:49.320> turns<00:03:49.530> out<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.980> if

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
looked into it and it turns out that if

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.590 
looked into it and it turns out that if
you<00:03:50.370> summon<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.880> mob<00:03:51.799> then

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
you summon a mob then

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.890 
you summon a mob then
I<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:53.900> do<00:03:54.590> join<00:03:55.280> hub<00:03:57.670> game-mode<00:03:58.700> s<00:03:59.000> as<00:03:59.660> you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
I just do join hub game-mode s as you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.820 
I just do join hub game-mode s as you
can<00:03:59.990> see<00:04:00.310> they<00:04:01.310> will<00:04:01.670> attack<00:04:02.060> me<00:04:02.470> join<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.650> hub

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
can see they will attack me join the hub

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.540 
can see they will attack me join the hub
and<00:04:04.220> now<00:04:05.150> they<00:04:05.330> won't<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.680> this<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.310> it's

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
and now they won't so this is it's

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.160 
and now they won't so this is it's
actually<00:04:08.060> pretty<00:04:08.360> cool<00:04:08.650> umm<00:04:10.330> one<00:04:11.330> one<00:04:11.900> idea

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
actually pretty cool umm one one idea

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.680 
actually pretty cool umm one one idea
that<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.470> had<00:04:12.740> for<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.100> was<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.300> remember<00:04:14.480> a

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
that I had for this was I remember a

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.260 
that I had for this was I remember a
very<00:04:15.050> long<00:04:15.380> time<00:04:15.680> ago<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.190> friend<00:04:16.670> of<00:04:16.850> mine<00:04:16.910> was

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
very long time ago a friend of mine was

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.270 
very long time ago a friend of mine was
trying<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.660> make<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:18.050> cloning<00:04:18.620> machine<00:04:18.650> and

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
trying to make a cloning machine and

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.060 
trying to make a cloning machine and
vanilla<00:04:19.700> but<00:04:20.690> he<00:04:20.959> couldn't<00:04:21.290> get<00:04:21.620> these

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
vanilla but he couldn't get these

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.500 
vanilla but he couldn't get these
zombies<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:23.270> not<00:04:23.750> attack<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.260> players<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.510> so

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
zombies to not attack the players and so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.240 
zombies to not attack the players and so
this<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.870> actually<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.290> very<00:04:27.620> good<00:04:27.680> way<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:27.980> do

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
this is actually a very good way to do

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.160 
this is actually a very good way to do
that<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:28.610> he<00:04:28.760> tried<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.120> use<00:04:29.240> armorstands<00:04:30.020> but

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
that and he tried to use armorstands but

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.720 
that and he tried to use armorstands but
he<00:04:30.230> just<00:04:30.410> didn't<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.920> look<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.340> for

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
he just didn't like the look of it for

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.860 
he just didn't like the look of it for
some<00:04:31.850> reason<00:04:32.210> or<00:04:32.330> something<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.840> I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
some reason or something like that I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.680 
some reason or something like that I
can't<00:04:33.170> actually<00:04:33.320> remember<00:04:33.500> why<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.420> yes<00:04:35.420> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
can't actually remember why but yes and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.660 
can't actually remember why but yes and
so<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.260> make<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.100> can't<00:04:37.310> hit<00:04:37.490> them

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
so to make it so that you can't hit them

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.430 
so to make it so that you can't hit them
all<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.030> have<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.270> do<00:04:38.420> is<00:04:38.660> just<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.170> some

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
all you have to do is just to do some

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.880 
all you have to do is just to do some
entity<00:04:40.310> data<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:41.050> change<00:04:42.050> them<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.350> in

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
entity data and change them to in

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.140 
entity data and change them to in
vulnerable<00:04:44.230> one<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:45.470> now<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.490> can't<00:04:46.970> hit

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
vulnerable one and now you can't hit

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.500 
vulnerable one and now you can't hit
them<00:04:47.330> they<00:04:47.630> can't<00:04:47.900> hit<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.790> so<00:04:49.790> it's<00:04:50.180> that's

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
them they can't hit you so it's that's

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.540 
them they can't hit you so it's that's
pretty<00:04:50.870> cool<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.140> guess<00:04:51.500> I'll<00:04:51.860> probably<00:04:52.250> be
