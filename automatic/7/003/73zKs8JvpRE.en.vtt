00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.390 
that sort and we don't use public games
either<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.500> don't<00:02:18.650> join<00:02:18.740> public<00:02:18.920> games<00:02:19.220> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.309 
either so we don't join public games so
rumor<00:02:20.090> goes<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.690> join<00:02:21.050> pull<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
rumor goes that if you join pull the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.380 
rumor goes that if you join pull the
games<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.650> MACT<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.430> increases<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.060> threat

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
games that MACT it increases the threat

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.300 
games that MACT it increases the threat
of<00:02:23.630> getting<00:02:24.200> hacked<00:02:24.470> because<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.010> session

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
of getting hacked because the session

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.670 
of getting hacked because the session
IDs<00:02:25.520> are<00:02:25.760> recycled<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:26.990> don't<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.470> so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
IDs are recycled but we don't do that so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.470 
IDs are recycled but we don't do that so
anyone<00:02:28.069> can<00:02:28.220> really<00:02:28.459> be<00:02:28.550> targeted<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.360> and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
anyone can really be targeted here and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.720 
anyone can really be targeted here and
so<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.630> question<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.230> minimize

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
so the question is how do you minimize

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.730 
so the question is how do you minimize
this<00:02:31.730> threat<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.360> we've<00:02:33.140> all<00:02:33.380> ordered

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
this threat and we've all ordered

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.980 
this threat and we've all ordered
authenticators<00:02:34.490> more<00:02:35.270> than<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.450> week<00:02:35.570> ago<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
authenticators more than a week ago it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.090 
authenticators more than a week ago it
was<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.290> unfortunate<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.770> they<00:02:36.860> haven't

see someone log off re login once and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.170 
see someone log off re login once and
then<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.160> bot<00:03:04.310> will<00:03:04.489> try<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.730> attempt<00:03:05.060> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
then the bot will try to attempt to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.759 
then the bot will try to attempt to
change<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.630> password<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.320> that's<00:03:06.500> when<00:03:06.650> you

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
change the password and that's when you

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.110 
change the password and that's when you
have<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.920> be<00:03:07.100> quick<00:03:07.310> enough<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.790> change<00:03:07.970> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
have to be quick enough to change it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.509 
have to be quick enough to change it
yourself<00:03:08.209> before<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.080> bot<00:03:09.440> does<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.950> then

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
yourself before the bot does and then

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.270 
yourself before the bot does and then
you<00:03:10.640> should<00:03:10.850> be<00:03:10.970> able<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.650> go<00:03:12.650> through<00:03:13.010> the

you should be able to go through the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.120 
you should be able to go through the
hacking<00:03:13.760> attempt<00:03:14.180> unscathed<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.980> we<00:03:15.980> really
