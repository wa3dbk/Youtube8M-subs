00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 that for my people am friend lamy 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.450
 this is almost creative and today we are going to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.670
 talk about the biblical creativity god 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.380
 created the world in seven days in the act 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 of greatest creativity ever 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.180
 registered by no written book this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 and so he did what he does not explain with 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.189
 details is how he managed similar 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.289
 feat what leaves a gap to numerous 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.199
 interpretations by minds 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 idlers like mine once a colleague me 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.520
 He said that God had to be a designer 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 graphic with a supreme pc in which 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 I was running a kind of photoshop 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.160
 heavenly where he created everything else 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 colleagues told me that it is impossible that if 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.260
 God was a graphic designer I could not use 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.719
 pc but more I am more of the belief of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 a celestial creative department with 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.989
 a lot of something more creative than 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.149
 they helped God in his work to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.620
 illustrate it the next sketch I hope 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 that triple in people already know that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.550
 I'm on twitter to comment on it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.600
 hug and until the next 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.600
 and he 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.460
 does not pretend to work in heaven is that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.420
 there's classical music playing in the background 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.000
 all the while all the rap the cheese for 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.710
 you or you can leave a little something 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.810
 that is reaching me who you have something 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
 what to teach was here just 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.080
 I was working on the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.110
 project I do not have everything finished but 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.970
 something to teach you I have that is a lot 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.860
 well you asked me to design a 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.740
 place for his creatures to live on 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.950
 baena good to me it occurred to me that such 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.660
 a planet a giant ball floating by 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.470
 space and that all his creatures 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:41.520
 live there and that their creatures are of 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.590
 two types one male and one female and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.270
 that the union of both will give fruit to more 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 creatures and so what we do is that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.800
 we promote love forgiveness' of the moment 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.020
 and everything that happens I feel it without wanting 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.330
 I heard that I wanted to ask them what's up 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 and the union is between masculine and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.090
 male or female and female what's up 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 that that has no value is not that those 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.570
 ideas we had not contemplated because 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.570
 I know what you wanted 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.100
 promote was him 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.860
 I say, I do not know, it may be my ideas 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.510
 left him there the creative are you another 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.510
 thing to do so I 'm sorry for 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.310

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.770
 nothing calm happens 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.120
 well we continue so that a creature 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.489
 new alaska a male part and a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.520

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.680
 very little thing as very childish no no 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.470
