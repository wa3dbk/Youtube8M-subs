00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 i 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.889
 very good to all kids and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.289
 welcome to a new bird 3 video 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 we return with the events just as 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.570
 we had left a memory that we had 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.980
 unlocked the rockstar energy drink 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.140
 what is this that you are seeing is the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.570
 trans world class but we will not enter 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 within the academy gymkhana option 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.919
 that I know you're cool with this whole 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 the without beds and such we have one 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.919
 unlocked which is the smash tutorial 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 which is the first as you are seeing 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.260
 then all the others are 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.219
 blocked in the absence of unlocking 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.350
 all the challenges that are posed to us 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.590
 so the first one that we have 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.150
 to start this is smash tutorial 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.980
 we go inside and he tells us that 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.329
 welcome academy the blocks of 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.220
 shock are the easiest trick 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.680
 simply destroy everything you can 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.739
 within the time available, well, well, 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.210
 tells us that we are going with a ford party 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.880
 which is the one in blog if I do not 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 I'm wrong and you know what a little 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.239
 all this is going to be a series of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.129
 tutorials I think that later they will go 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.869
 pose a series of challenges and if it does not happen 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.540
 nothing and all good today I'm going to upload two 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 challenges of this academy gymkhana event 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950
 I hope you like it and enjoy it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.729
 same as me 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.079
 of the blank speed what happens if not 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.909
 you've seen the videos of this guy not 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.580
 you know what a wild piloting is 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.270
 who is the best driver 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.270
 and one of the biggest and most innovative 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.179
 the sound level has gone up 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.439
 cristian I'm putting red I just say 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.939
 what is colleague 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.799
 good once you have learned to do 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.289
 gymkhana we will start to think 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.009
 challenges so pay attention to everything 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.009
 what who says to you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.160
 we are going to update you as to 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:54.060
 speed is going to be a pass and says that 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.310
 happens it seems like it's a bit expensive 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.259
 flat 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.479
 Well for now we are here with 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.119
 our ford party and as in each 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.579
 start of event let's play a little 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.770
 the vehicle settings in this case 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.300
 without having a damn idea we are going to put 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.239
 a short change ratio 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.190
 high aerodynamic high hard suspension 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.290
 a low differential driving you 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.720
 we leave as is and the distribution of 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.069
 braking we take it forward a 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.980
 point no more come as we started already 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.510
 see how it feels 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.760
 what better way to start your 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.670
 training that destroying things from 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.500
 what 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.690
 the blocks of shock are the trick most 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.380
 simple that you are going to learn go to 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.900
 they 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.659
 each block against which they will be united 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.849
 destruction who has already told you how to 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.290
 do I have enough blocks to 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.299
 get a bronze medal in the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.299
 next tutorial to crash 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.740
 What's up 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.250
 look 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.250
 not going 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.209
 well I 'm going 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.209
 when we go we are recovering 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.390
 of the paella 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:33.610
 I recorded down 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.610
 but yes sir 183 thousand points 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.379
 well you have seen it is easy simply 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.720
 it is about as in a small 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.310
 closed circuit is going hitting with that 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.040
 is what is being yellow 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.930
 and forcada for each one of the blocks 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.650
 that give a series of points does not have more 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.540
 mystery that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.480
 it is therefore to do it in time 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.489
 that pose to you and then get the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.129
 more blocks or points in 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.220
 this case to be able to get a 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.340
 gold medal, silver, gold or platinum 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.049
 eye that I do believe that if you manage to hit 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.019
 all the blocks that you raise in the 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.099
 challenge of giving the platinum medal with what 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.959
 I do not know if we'll get any but 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.910
 at least we have a gold that is not 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.079
 nothing bad the truth is that I am in Cana 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.090
 it has always given me enough of 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.010
 respect because you have to have a lot 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.650
 control over the car and doing it very 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.470
 good to do something and get something out 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.060
 decent so nothing we will see in what 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.680
 reputation point level we are 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.990
 we are in the fifth give us 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.960
 800 gold medal bonus 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.270
 points so we 've stayed in the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.599
 fifth but almost almost reaching the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.970
 sixth level and we unlocked a new 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.919
 tutorial that is the one of siam the one of jump 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.330
 so let's go see what we 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.770
 we found but as you are seeing then 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.420
 is going to be a tutorial of hitting jumps with 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.550
 the car sounds has more 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.530
 tells us this goes jumping jumps 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.270
 as many points as you can while staying 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.580
 in the air as long as possible 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.430
 jump from the ramps when we continue 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.720
 with the ford ken block party and good 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.130
 let's see how it feels 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.400
 tutorial as I said at the beginning 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.070
 I'm going to upload two challenges not one as 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.780
 as usual because they are somewhat short 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.090
 and it's not about uploading a video 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.350
 of four minutes in this case as they are 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.810
 tutorials and so on so let's go up 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.880
 Well, a couple is worth, come on, let's go as 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.460
 this one higher and we're going to touch the 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.190
 car settings we put the ratio of 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.100
 short change 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.890
 aerodynamics lowers the suspension 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.640
 we put soft high driving height 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:43.040
 the differential we put hard and the 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.860
 braking cast we throw it towards 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.860
 go ahead, come on, let's start 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.479
 that's about jumping without air vocation 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.190
 some advice for our pilot that 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.840
 good is perfect 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.700
 the trick is to find the line 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.500
 correct in the jump take so much 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.270
 speed as you can to stay in 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.550
 the maximum air but beware 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.950
 because you will need to maintain control 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.260
 in the landing so the more 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.970
 good more points look for the triangles 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.220
 they tell you how you did it three 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.100
 triangles mean that you have embroidered 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.660
 and that you have the maximum score then 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.660
 that in blog to the beret 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.469
 water 6820 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.300
 or 10,000 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.300
 Y 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.570
 ten thousand more 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.900
 10,000 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.110
 wow 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.470
 ah 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.240
 yes sir latin 46 thousand eight hundred 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.020
 twenty points 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.020
 it would be fine 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.819
 well we put the repetition but the 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.849
 roll is simply in as you see here 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:11.690
 skid as close as possible to the pivot 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:14.990
 get away when we skid and take the 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.879
 maximum distance to jump more 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.720
 away and keep us longer in the 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:22.970
 air with what the skid should be or 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.330
 we should move away as much as we can 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.949
 to take the maximum run to 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.470
 the time to jump this is a pass 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.419
 here as entrance here on the porch and the 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.190
 truth is that good a little dish is the 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.680
 first platinum that I get in this game 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.889
 and the truth is that I'm happy not what 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.900
 following 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.900
 so nothing kids we continue 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.300
 tells us that there is nothing better than 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.139
 get a platinum obviously because 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.750
 is the highest medal after gold and 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.210
 nothing let's see what score gives us 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.819
 of good modification by medal 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.220
 platinum thousand points of reputation I do not know to 

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:02.660
 what do we have to do? 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.240
 6 

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.740
 pinewood kids now comes another 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.390
 tutorial that this yes we 're going to 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.370
 leave now for the next video that is 

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.640
 the drift as you are seeing to see 

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:15.740
 what it is about we see it in any case in the 

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.310
 next voucher come kids a greeting 

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.310
 see you later
