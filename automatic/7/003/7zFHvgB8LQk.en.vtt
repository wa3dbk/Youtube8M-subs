00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.240
 grimm crimea 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.430
 that is a lexicon or can you do everything 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.380
 possible coconut-modified starch 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.789

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.770

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.640

 suspected cancer has excite us 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.479
 I often find the ass saved 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.100

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.679
 and if I always buy something new 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.119
 adjusted then also a very good one 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.500
 book there are some of you that 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.020
 somehow do not believe that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.670
 the miraculous liver and gallbladder 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.649

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.200
 simple technology also has one 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.609
 Video made and find the book very much 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.229
 interesting and I already have that 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.060
 made three times with my liver 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.369
 Cleaning is possible the third time too 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.780
 hardly anything out and my allergies 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.159
 have declined significantly by 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.689
 this trick and I am generally 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.420
 better than my love works 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.670
 now much better then again 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.770
 very good book also the bomb under the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.790

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.920
 healthy family 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.390
 I found that very very extreme back then 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 read a few years ago 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 I'm also vegan there I was 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.700
 no legal and he has no use 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.130
 dios because of the aluminum and none 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.990
 perfumes because the hormones get mixed up 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.250
 can go through the hormones 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.260
 the old ones are also a few rangers 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 you do not have to be very interesting 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 but it was very enlightening 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.400
 because of the aluminum also in all the it 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.860
 then a good book the emergency lie 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.360
 is again something of the jr counts 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.580
 which is partly in salt in 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.560
 ready meals something like that if you are afraid 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.110
 have iodine deficiency or hashimoto 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.910
 or any other thyroid 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.750
 make sure you get this book 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.980
 look in there 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.050
 it may be too much 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.130

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.870

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 as I lead now 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.170
 with a very simple trick comes in 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.370
 two weeks, I show what and that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.670
 book is highly recommended 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.080
 then very important also a huge book 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.650
 yes from the doctor brucker yes, too 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.090
 has taught whole foods and very many 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.850
 books on the topic together of the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.590
 careful corridor there it is about what is 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.140
 now really with fluorine and fluoride in 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.810
 our toothpaste in as tablets and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.130
 in drinking water even in the usa has to do 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.750
 There was already a test in Vienna 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.910
 faith, everything is in the book here 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.220
 everything with the evidence of the studies 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.440
 very important for everyone to know who 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.329
 want to eat a healthy diet which includes a 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.070
 have family where they have to decide 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.600
 Whether your children's hallway tablets or something 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.200
 Just get this book 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.380
 look into 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.739
 and last but not least the book 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.120
 vaccinate pros and cons of martin shepherd 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.950
 We find it very good because it is not against 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.269
 the vaccine is it is not 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.519
 for all vaccines 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.220
 You can be very neutral about it 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.930
 I inform that an objective book 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.250
 think very well about a personal 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.720
 To make a decision 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.400
 Everyone has to decide for themselves, but 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.170
 get vaccinated or his children but 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.910
 he prefers to get vaccinated against everything 0 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.650
 against the half or whatever 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.420
 That helps with the decision but needs 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.890
 Everyone knows that I would never 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.470
 Someone say you have to do it that way 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.790
 make a little overview so we can 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.320
 still have a lot more books 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.180
 but those are the most important ones 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.739
 I just found it now 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.080
 Have fun looking at my info box 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.550
