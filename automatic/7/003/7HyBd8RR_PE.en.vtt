time ago but i wanted to do a new one
quicker<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.809> point<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.410> hopefully<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> bit

quicker to the point and hopefully a bit

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
quicker to the point and hopefully a bit
easier<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.790> understand<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.230> need<00:00:13.410> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
easier to understand so what you need to

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
drops are extremely effective they can

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.560 
drops are extremely effective they can
just<00:01:54.439> destroy<00:01:54.799> entire<00:01:55.280> armies<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.030> seconds

and<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.229> cool<00:01:57.409> thing<00:01:57.560> about<00:01:57.590> bailing<00:01:58.009> drops

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
and the cool thing about bailing drops

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.940 
and the cool thing about bailing drops
is<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.600> overlords<00:02:00.110> won't<00:02:00.380> be<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.709> priority

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
is the overlords won't be the priority

attacking any hostile units like these

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.270 
attacking any hostile units like these
instead<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> overlords<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.560> even<00:02:10.190> if

they do attack the overlords just put a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.660 
they do attack the overlords just put a

decoy<00:02:14.150> overlords<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.410> still<00:02:15.620> get

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
decoy overlords and you can still get

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.710 
decoy overlords and you can still get
most<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.069> your<00:02:16.130> banelings<00:02:16.610> out<00:02:16.790> dropped<00:02:17.480> onto

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
most of your banelings out dropped onto

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.460 
most of your banelings out dropped onto
the<00:02:17.959> enemy<00:02:18.230> army<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.660> I've<00:02:20.750> set<00:02:20.900> up<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.140> quick

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the enemy army so I've set up a quick

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.080 
the enemy army so I've set up a quick
little<00:02:21.650> scenario<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> see<00:02:22.850> how

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
little scenario here just to see how

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.630 
little scenario here just to see how
well<00:02:23.569> bailing<00:02:24.500> drops<00:02:24.709> can<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.130> against<00:02:25.400> an

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
well bailing drops can do against an

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.479 
well bailing drops can do against an
opponent<00:02:26.330> now<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.349> course<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.739> huge<00:02:28.190> toss

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
opponent now of course is a huge toss

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.430 
opponent now of course is a huge toss
army<00:02:28.910> compared<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.299> this<00:02:29.390> tiny<00:02:29.660> Zerg<00:02:29.930> army<00:02:30.260> but

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
army compared to this tiny Zerg army but

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.509 
army compared to this tiny Zerg army but
I<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:30.650> want<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.040> see<00:02:31.160> how<00:02:31.190> much

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
I just want you to see how much

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.039 
I just want you to see how much
banelings<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.180> actually<00:02:32.480> kill<00:02:32.720> when<00:02:32.930> their

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
banelings can actually kill when their

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.380 
banelings can actually kill when their
drops<00:02:33.290> directly<00:02:33.799> on<00:02:33.950> top<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.340> an<00:02:34.459> army<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.970> won't

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
drops directly on top of an army I won't

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.880 
drops directly on top of an army I won't
be<00:02:35.480> using<00:02:35.630> any<00:02:35.810> micro<00:02:36.320> or<00:02:36.440> anything<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:36.739> that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
be using any micro or anything like that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.620 
be using any micro or anything like that
it's<00:02:37.250> actually<00:02:37.519> kind<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.030> ridiculous

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
it's actually kind of a ridiculous

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.020 
it's actually kind of a ridiculous
example<00:02:39.140> but<00:02:39.290> hopefully<00:02:40.220> it'll<00:02:40.640> be<00:02:40.790> cool

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
example but hopefully it'll be cool

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.090 
example but hopefully it'll be cool
nonetheless<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:41.900> here<00:02:42.079> we<00:02:42.170> go<00:02:42.320> attack

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
nonetheless so here we go attack

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.160 
nonetheless so here we go attack
commanding<00:02:43.579> attack<00:02:43.850> commanding<00:02:44.359> moving

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
commanding attack commanding moving

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.319 
commanding attack commanding moving
these<00:02:45.290> hope<00:02:45.739> floors<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.579> gonna<00:02:47.180> be

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
these hope floors in and gonna be

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.449 
these hope floors in and gonna be
dropping<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:48.019> them

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
dropping on them

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.559 
dropping on them
so<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.819> can<00:02:50.879> kind<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.239> guide<00:02:51.390> them

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
so you can see I can kind of guide them

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.000 
so you can see I can kind of guide them
where<00:02:51.749> to<00:02:51.840> go<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.439> just<00:02:52.620> slaughtered

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
where to go and I just slaughtered

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.369 
where to go and I just slaughtered
almost<00:02:53.459> every<00:02:53.819> single<00:02:53.999> century<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:55.049> entire

Protoss<00:02:55.889> army<00:02:56.219> is<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.609> weak<00:02:56.879> now<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.329> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
Protoss army is so weak now and the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.319 
Protoss army is so weak now and the
roaches<00:02:57.749> might<00:02:57.959> even<00:02:58.260> win<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.999> no<00:02:59.999> micro

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
roaches might even win this no micro

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
banelings is usually enough but

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.449 
banelings is usually enough but
sometimes<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.639> want<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.909> overlords<00:03:33.510> full<00:03:33.689> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
sometimes you want to overlords full and

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
to use one overlord so drop drop drop

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.449 
to use one overlord so drop drop drop
now<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.260> reason<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.769> include<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.189> couple

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.149 
now the reason you include a couple
Ling's<00:03:44.699> is<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.989> see<00:03:46.199> at<00:03:46.469> one<00:03:46.739> banding

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
Ling's is you can see at one banding

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.429 
Ling's is you can see at one banding
will<00:03:47.310> do<00:03:47.489> about<00:03:47.699> 35<00:03:48.209> damage<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> drone<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
will do about 35 damage to a drone and

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.110 
will do about 35 damage to a drone and
two<00:03:49.949> links<00:03:50.310> will<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.549> able<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.760> clean<00:03:50.939> that<00:03:51.060> up

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
two links will be able to clean that up

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.569 
two links will be able to clean that up
so<00:03:51.510> fast<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.409> not<00:03:55.799> always<00:03:55.979> best<00:03:56.310> just<00:03:56.489> to

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
so fast so it's not always best just to

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.309 
so fast so it's not always best just to
include<00:03:56.909> all<00:03:57.150> banelings<00:03:57.659> in<00:03:57.810> your<00:03:57.930> overlords
