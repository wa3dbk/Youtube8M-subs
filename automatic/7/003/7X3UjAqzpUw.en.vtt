00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.400
 do not 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.550
 and without that hector to 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.650
 is the aspect ever tried that the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.910
 ground 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.910
 this because this 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.090
 and I mean in video 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 this has cost everyone's day like 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.220
 two things the commercials then pulling 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.220
 humans scratching in all places 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.560
 with only three weeks 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 to pass everything 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.770
 well then when it's not like that 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:03.910
 the maximum would be there 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.910
 try to click on do this 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 and what do you want to have there first 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 and what 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 friends 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.270
 and those below who do not know what it is like 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.110
 if I am I kept it 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.110
 I'm not full with the line 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 yes 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.440
 and when it goes up and down 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.130
 at that time no friends and it is not going to 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.130
 fall out 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.260
 your goal to do this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.940
 another thing 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760
 before 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.360
 and connecting techniques has to be very 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.090
 fast that it is lavalle and 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.770
 here so well strong but all and much 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.630
 taught they're going to think that you should see them from 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.730
 gold 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.800
 web why when the sky is normal 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.500
 that is crazy to jump and bent a little 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.890
 that because to achieve it well 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.890
 with what they are hugo at the beginning with that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.750
 are you 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.290
 yes 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.290
 yes 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.800
 and well this is the millennium tried 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.580
 collect and all to be able to continue with what 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.580
 obvious 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.580
 all right 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.310
 how to have it there is in all this that I 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.920
 it sounds 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.440
 if that movement could therefore 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.780
 study yes good when we see clear 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.140
 when and when hungary then has 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.480
 been creating little ones like these 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.200
 I need something like that 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.200
 and why 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.300
 the paper 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.250
 Oh no 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.699
 the goal of missing this goal to 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.699
 this metro 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.320
 and we can evaluate with our clinic 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.320
 style bags 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:56.180
 but fast movement because I hope that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.180
 so be it give us very interior 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.529
 the disc 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.060
 comes 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.790
 I lost him 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.970
 do not 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.210
 His hand could be more combined than 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.210
 monetary 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.940
 and then turn my new aesthetics 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.770
 zero 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.969
 let's also do it, it is a 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.889
 Grace 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:31.719
 and I know he said 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.719
 and so much 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.070
 listen that I'm starting 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.070
 much 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.600
 and then easier to do politics 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.920
 of the command would follow if a circuit 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.840
 about this good sir this with all 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.920
 this is small maybe something long the 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.240
 space along 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.240
 But it is necessary 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.639
 never 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.440
 for
