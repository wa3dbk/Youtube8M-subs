00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.679
 hello everyone from the txingas channel 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.020
 teacher and we'll see how to make a trap 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.380
 for mice to do it we need 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.610
 some scissors bait like cheese 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.730
 I have taken this cover simply 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.580
 because I did not have now that osama not a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.940
 barbecue stick a piece of cardboard 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.560
 that is rigid and a cube by which it is 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.450
 of metal or plastic so that the rats 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.100
 can not scale and that is enough 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.510
 So deep for that so that it does not 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.970
 can escape 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.360
 Well the first thing we do is cut 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.130
 the cardboard roughly a little circle 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.100
 bigger than we have 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.680
 here then well we cut it to a 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.430
 once we have cut the circle what 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 we have to do 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.330
 half cut it here leave a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.220
 hollow about 4 centimeters and cut and 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.610
 cut so that half a circle remains 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.850
 with an outgoing strip around here so 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.040
 well now we cut it now that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.520
 we have cut with this form what 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.520
 we will do it will be to place it here if we see that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.770
 this excels at cutting it and now what 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.890
 we will do will be with him with glue 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.220
 we will stick a rod 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.460
 of the barbecue 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.280
 in this sense more or less 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.229
 here 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.930
 more or less around here so we throw the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.030
 tail and that's it then 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.890
 what is the trap would already be ready what 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.430
 what we have to do is leave 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.000
 the food in this part the edge that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.200
 stick on the edge of the cardboard that sticks 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.640
 on the edge the bin for this 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.409
 be firm and put a ramp to put a 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.570
 ramp or simply leave it at the level of 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.119
 a step for rats or mice 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.220
 can climb here then when going up 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.950
 here they will see the cheese what we have 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.520
 Bait station will go for it and when 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.549
 arrive 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.130
 will weigh more will be unbalanced and will fall 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.869
 in because when they are here it seems 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.349
 which is solid but as soon as they put their 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.489
 weight here slips and falls inside 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.489
 so good
