00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.759
 week the senate guitar and around a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.610
 offense of the current constitution has 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.350

 Fed up 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:53.850
 he's really fed up but this 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:57.989
 mounted by a law that followed the race 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.940
 and I do not want there and powers 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.859
 have remained concentrated between 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 the hands of the monarchy since the king 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.659
 still remains the chairman of the board 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:21.689

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.250

 bob gainey brother i'm a lover 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.490
 from Morocco and so I'm going regular 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:45.409
 in four five times a year I believe that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:53.270
 the change is visible Ã  la carte 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:55.799
 it's like this hand fault 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.750
 we want a constituent assembly 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.850
 whoever they are elected by the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.829
 people that is the emanation of the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600
 popular will is not the emanation 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.569
 of a scheme that has proven 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 incompetence for decades for 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.319
 me moroccan are moroccans 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.440
 it is they who must work to say 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.650
 that of course there is the king leroy me he goes 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.910
 not to prevent someone who has an idea of 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.110
 do you do something good not the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.870
 say do not do it and the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.970
 chairman of the security council we 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.319
 will have done four rounds 4-6 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.140
 nathalie even our future with her if 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.120
 our future 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.940
 with m6 our future with m6 it's 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 chairman of the board unfold and he has 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.660
 the right to legislate so it's a 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.770
 lane seems parliament will live 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.090
 as it says long live king long live king 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.280
 Long live the king, it is for

 hold the king year for the king and with 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.030
 the king and we can die on the cross 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.270

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.270
 democratic 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.010
 he has the right to dissolve parliament 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.860
 he has the right to dismiss ministers 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.910
 so he still has almost all of 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.130
 powers in the hands in for 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.019
 we it is we can not speak of a 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.660
 rule of law under these conditions 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.610
 even if wade radiation you are laughing 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.110
 volumes algae north which it is necessary that 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.989
 the court itself to the people and 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:51.670
 not about to give birth to 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:56.560
 geneva has digital evidence come 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.570

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.079

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.750

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.579
 Morocco has systematically resorted to 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.850
 violence against all movements 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.680
 of protests throughout history 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.040
 it's an absolute monarchy it's a 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.040
 autocracy 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.079

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.909
 do not do a lot of things to 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.909
 avoid
