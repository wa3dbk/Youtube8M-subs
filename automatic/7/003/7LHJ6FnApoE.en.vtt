00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.910 

now<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.760> way<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.090> know<00:02:19.270> that's<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:20.290> pure

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
now the way we know that's actually pure

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.920 
now the way we know that's actually pure
gold<00:02:21.190> what<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.520> happened<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.120> will<00:02:22.420> see<00:02:22.750> no

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
gold what what happened you will see no

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.170 
gold what what happened you will see no
reaction<00:02:23.380> if<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.610> gold

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
reaction if it is not gold

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.300 
reaction if it is not gold
it<00:02:25.300> will<00:02:25.420> turn<00:02:25.570> black<00:02:26.020> right<00:02:26.410> away<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.740> 22

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
it will turn black right away this is 22

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.770 
it will turn black right away this is 22
karat<00:02:30.580> acid<00:02:30.880> which<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> highest<00:02:31.360> acid

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
karat acid which is the highest acid

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.470 
karat acid which is the highest acid
that<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.140> get<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.490> see<00:02:33.550> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that you can get and as you can see it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.390 
that you can get and as you can see it
doesn't<00:02:34.750> fade<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.890> tells<00:02:36.070> me<00:02:36.280> that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
doesn't fade so so that tells me that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.730 
doesn't fade so so that tells me that
it's<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.760> minimum<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.420> 22<00:02:37.720> karat<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.320> we<00:02:38.410> deduced

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
it's a minimum of 22 karat so we deduced

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.660 
it's a minimum of 22 karat so we deduced
from<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.370> 24<00:02:39.970> karat<00:02:40.240> gold<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
from that that this is 24 karat gold it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.130 
from that that this is 24 karat gold it
is<00:02:42.940> 24<00:02:43.660> karat<00:02:44.080> gold<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.540> if<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.750> get<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> chance

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
is 24 karat gold and if you get a chance

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.920 
is 24 karat gold and if you get a chance
go<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.710> stop
