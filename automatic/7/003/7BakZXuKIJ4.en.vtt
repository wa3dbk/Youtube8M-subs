 that is to say he then inherited the best as a medicinal plant 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.970
 already the key aspects used as a miracle cure against a lot of 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:27.939
 diseases 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.849
 in folk medicine she is known for her 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.120
 intensity in mind 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.680
 purifying degreasing tpd acidify 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 today we also know that it has a positive influence both 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.530
 on the sugar level and the level of fat in the blood 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.810
 for example cholesterol 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.210
 but it must be said that there are different kinds of ideal love 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.500
 the real gallery saw the new star 2010 eto'o son of dr kieny 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 cultivated in dry regions, particularly in Central America and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 South America 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.199
 the effectiveness of the law and rats depends mainly on its treatment 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.770
 but the differences are made from the harvest 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.200
 to avoid damaging the plant families must be cut to the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.430
 hand 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.130
 like the top film of the ofa it's ok for the toxic halloween that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.120
 protects the plant against animals 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.310
 there is a laxative effect for the human being 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 we must separate the wrapped young interior 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.390
 the gel is the most precious element of louis ferrara 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.970
 it alone contains more than 150 important components and a 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.409
 beneficial to health such as vitamins 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.320
 in sixth 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.509
 polysaccharides 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.820
 and trace elements 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.970
 and it is precisely this unique combination that association of different 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 substances it causes the facts medicine 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.660
 one of the most important components and the cemac 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.200
 it has a positive influence on the immune system and decreases further 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 share inflammations and free radicals 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.360
 the result 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.380
 an improvement in oxygen supply 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190
 observe this phenomenon more closely 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.120
 the blood assimilate the oxygen in the lung and transports it through the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.459
 blood vessels to the cells 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.129
 the big ships divide and become smaller and smaller for 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.599
 finally become capillaries 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.329
 the capillaries are the smallest blood vessels 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.150
 this is where the transfer of oxygen from the blood vessel to the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
 summits 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.879
 an unhealthy diet to environmental pollution the stress 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.879
 and high demands weaken our immune system 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.289
 the radical-liberals the game easier and may lead to pickups 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.519
 inflammation in the body 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.199
 these inflammations alternate mice causes a thickening of the walls 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.829
 capillaries 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.619
 this swelling shrinks the vessel and the red blood cells circulate more 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.519
 slowly through the capillaries 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.519
 so enter a decline in oxygen supply 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.620
 and that's where the law will see interview and it reduces the goff along 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.959
 capillary walls 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.539
 red blood cells circulate faster and oxygen supply 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.869
 is improved 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.089
 toxins and impurities are evacuated more quickly 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.819
 m 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.379
 recent studies indicate that other natural substances may 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.179
 still improve the facts of the food 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.649
 among these substances, it is first necessary to mention silicon 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.570
 but also gave him grade 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.189
 and finally the basic minerals 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.259
 first observing silicon a little closer 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:43.069
 silicon is essential to the body it's an element I tell you 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.009
 kill 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.379
 we know it mostly in the form of quartz sand that we find in 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.779
 stone and concrete 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.649
 in the body silicon helps stabilize tissues 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.599
 but it also strengthens the jumps the probes the hair 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.599
 2 connective tissue and capillary walls 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.060
 with age the capillaries threaten to lose their firmness 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.959
 they can literally fall apart which results in a 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.579
 interruption of blood flow 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.469
 it is in the worst case this can lead to vascular incidents 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.729
 cerebral and infarct the silicon strengthen support of the walls of 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.049
 capillaries it keeps - thus the blood vessel open 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.770
 the globules can thus continue to supply the cells with oxygen 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.330
 but the human body can not eat silicon in its form 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.810
 of origin, quartz sand, however, nature offers 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.159
 alternatives 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.159
 and in particular a family company their title 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.369
 because it is rich in natural silicon better assimilated by the human being 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.909
 optimal oxygenation does not only depend on the capillaries 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.059
 but also and especially the state of the spell 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.389
 the sense of good circulation in the capillaries doubt that if the 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.120
 sufficiently fluid 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.900
 some substances can improve the fluidity of the blood gave him fat with 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.259
 these unsaturated fatty acids and naturally the basic minerals 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
 and unsaturated fatty acids are blood thinners 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.919
 they prevented the blood cells of the one who was born and therefore a thickening of the 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.599
 blood 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.379
 the basic minerals support the elasticity of red blood cells and 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.379
 thus facilitating their passage through the capillaries 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.849
 these two elements improves the fluidity of the blood - and guarantee 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.849
 so its optimal oxygen supply 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.999
 let me recap 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:41.090
 satisfactory oxygenation of our cells is an important condition of 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.719
 our health and also prevented serious diseases 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.829
 Aloe vera and its effect and decongestant improves 

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:50.569
 oxygenation 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.099
 silicon strengthen the walls of the capillaries regard blood vessels 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.449
 or do 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.210
 for this purpose is reinforced by him gave a serious 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.979
 and also by the basic minerals 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.909
 what folk medicine had known for a long time and now 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.909
 confirmed by modern research 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.969
 the food to improve the oxygen supply and therefore our health 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.580
 46th moviegoer 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.580
