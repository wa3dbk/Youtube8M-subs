relevant<00:01:41.159> information<00:01:41.250> old<00:01:42.240> technology<00:01:42.869> has

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
relevant information old technology has

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.770 
relevant information old technology has
a<00:01:43.079> renewed<00:01:43.500> importance<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> ICU<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.630> have

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
a renewed importance in the ICU we have

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
a renewed importance in the ICU we have
a<00:01:45.810> pneumatic<00:01:46.350> tube<00:01:46.530> system<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> hospital

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a pneumatic tube system in the hospital

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.880 
a pneumatic tube system in the hospital
now<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.149> will<00:01:48.329> allow<00:01:48.360> us<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.619> send

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
now that will allow us to to send

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.090 
now that will allow us to to send
specimens<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:51.119> send<00:01:51.329> requisitions

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
specimens to send requisitions

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.719 
specimens to send requisitions
medications<00:01:53.100> from<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.460> area<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
medications from one area of the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.300 
medications from one area of the
hospital<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:55.070> essentially<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
hospital to the other in essentially the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
hospital to the other in essentially the
same<00:01:56.610> technology<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.450> used<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:58.020> ships<00:01:58.649> in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
same technology as we used in ships in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249 
same technology as we used in ships in
the<00:01:58.979> late<00:01:59.159> 18-hundreds<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.110> air

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the late 18-hundreds it's a it's an air

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
the late 18-hundreds it's a it's an air
tube<00:02:01.560> system<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> canister<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
tube system with a with a canister it's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.730 
tube system with a with a canister it's
obviously<00:02:03.630> updated<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.560> digital

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
obviously updated so there's digital

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.280 
obviously updated so there's digital
address<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.520> where<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.790> going<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.290> allows

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
address or where it's going and allows

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.600 
address or where it's going and allows
you<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> quickly<00:02:07.649> move<00:02:08.009> things<00:02:08.340> from<00:02:08.520> one

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you to quickly move things from one

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.999 
you to quickly move things from one
place<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> hospital<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> other

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
place in the hospital to the other

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
place in the hospital to the other
without<00:02:11.009> having<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.480> somebody<00:02:12.780> come

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
without having to to have somebody come

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920 
without having to to have somebody come
and<00:02:13.590> carry<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.100> physically<00:02:14.790> what's<00:02:15.480> left<00:02:15.780> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and carry it physically what's left to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
articulating arms to be installed those

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.900 
articulating arms to be installed those
get<00:02:22.500> installed<00:02:22.800> later<00:02:23.010> obviously<00:02:23.310> all<00:02:23.820> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
get installed later obviously all the
