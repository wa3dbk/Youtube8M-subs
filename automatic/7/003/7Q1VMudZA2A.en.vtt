knife<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.980> works<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:23.699> -<00:00:24.170> you<00:00:25.170> can

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
knife this works just as well - you can

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.040 
knife this works just as well - you can
very<00:00:26.039> carefully<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:27.090> X<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.810> tip<00:00:29.779> being<00:00:30.779> very

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

to<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.550> cut<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.420> X<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> tip<00:00:37.579> will

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
to get cut you can just X the tip will

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.690 
to get cut you can just X the tip will
actually<00:00:38.940> fold<00:00:39.239> back<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.739> roasts<00:00:41.250> that's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
actually fold back as it roasts that's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
actually fold back as it roasts that's
one<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:43.040> or<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:45.530> cut<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
slash or an X I like to be able to hang

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
slash or an X I like to be able to hang
on<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.379> tightly<00:00:49.710> myself<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:51.239> kind<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
on to it tightly myself and just kind of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.670 
on to it tightly myself and just kind of
big<00:00:51.690> X<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:53.239> like<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.809> works<00:00:55.350> fine

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
big X in it like that that works fine

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.529 
big X in it like that that works fine
too<00:00:56.750> you<00:00:57.750> know<00:00:57.840> another<00:00:58.109> method<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.539> slash

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
too you know another method is to slash

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.680 
too you know another method is to slash
it<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.190> there's<00:01:02.430> other<00:01:03.149> methods<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it and then there's other methods that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
it and then there's other methods that
you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.409> around<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you can go all the way around I have a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.310 
you can go all the way around I have a
rough<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.119> hanging<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
rough time hanging on to it that way but

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.880 
rough time hanging on to it that way but
you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.710> also<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> slash<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
you can also just do a slash like this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
you can also just do a slash like this
you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> actually<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.640> deep<00:01:11.909> enough<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you want to actually go deep enough that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.260 
you want to actually go deep enough that
you<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> flush<00:01:14.000> watch<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you get into the flush watch your

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
you get into the flush watch your
fingers<00:01:18.830> go<00:01:19.830> ahead<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> couple<00:01:20.580> more

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
fingers go ahead and do a couple more

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.940 
fingers go ahead and do a couple more
than

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.620 

get<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:25.790> like<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:27.159> sit<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.250> down<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.450> its

round side hold it firmly and then do a

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:48.099 
round side hold it firmly and then do a
good<00:01:33.350> X<00:01:33.650> like<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.369> works<00:01:34.610> for<00:01:34.820> me

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.809 

and<00:01:49.109> it's<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.710> quite<00:01:50.130> fast<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
and it's actually quite fast but you

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.739 
and it's actually quite fast but you
have<00:01:50.969> a<00:01:50.999> good<00:01:51.210> firm<00:01:51.509> hold<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:53.509> we've<00:01:54.509> got<00:01:54.719> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
hot 350 to 375 oven waiting and we're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.399 
hot 350 to 375 oven waiting and we're
gonna<00:01:59.969> throw<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> roast<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.229> now

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
gonna throw them in and roast them now

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
gonna throw them in and roast them now
at<00:02:01.649> about<00:02:01.819> anywhere<00:02:02.819> from<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.209> small<00:02:03.509> size<00:02:03.780> like

at about anywhere from a small size like

at about anywhere from a small size like
this<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.770> probably<00:02:05.159> pretty<00:02:05.310> common

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
this which is probably pretty common

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.960 
this which is probably pretty common
size<00:02:06.060> maybe<00:02:06.479> 15<00:02:06.929> minutes<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.740> size<00:02:07.970> if

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
size maybe 15 minutes for this size if

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.949 
size maybe 15 minutes for this size if
you're<00:02:09.119> fortunate<00:02:09.360> enough<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.840> some

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you're fortunate enough to have some

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.440 
you're fortunate enough to have some
larger<00:02:10.530> chestnuts<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.549> this<00:02:11.819> maybe<00:02:12.180> even

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
larger chestnuts like this maybe even

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.869 
larger chestnuts like this maybe even
2530<00:02:13.610> minutes

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
2530 minutes

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.150 
2530 minutes
it's<00:02:15.390> important<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.930> taste<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.769> every<00:02:16.980> once

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
it's important to taste one every once

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.900 
it's important to taste one every once
in<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.340> while<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:18.299> see<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:20.040> how<00:02:20.160> soft<00:02:20.610> they're

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
in a while and see just how soft they're

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.860 
in a while and see just how soft they're
becoming<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.500> will<00:02:22.709> start<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.069> peel<00:02:23.280> back

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
becoming this will start to peel back

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.089 
becoming this will start to peel back
and<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.959> will<00:02:25.049> expose<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.410> nut<00:02:25.769> underneath

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
and it will expose the nut underneath

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.710 
and it will expose the nut underneath
which<00:02:26.370> would<00:02:26.519> be<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.910> pretty<00:02:27.209> golden

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
which would be a really pretty golden

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.440 
which would be a really pretty golden
brown<00:02:28.079> if<00:02:28.440> they're<00:02:28.739> black<00:02:29.160> or<00:02:29.549> look<00:02:29.879> mouldy<00:02:30.360> in

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
brown if they're black or look mouldy in
