00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 for direct staff of são paulo we 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.170
 Let's check out the family launch. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.120
 g4 in Brazil the main model is 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.840
 exactly the same presented in new 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.910
 york 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.040
 the great news is that in addition to the version 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 with the chip was confirmed the model of the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 I have already told him that one of the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.400
 lg g 4 is your camera 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.550
 but can you use it in any way 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 Professional I use smartphone to cei 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.149
 Since birth I use to take photos 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.579
 Of course because revolution is not emotion 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.030
 changed the way people face 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.020
 the photograph as they face a world right 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.219
 The difference is that it has a quality 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 outstanding 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.200
 so much so that if you take a look at the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.190
 copies I made here I do not know 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.039
 no other smartphone that does this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 then okay to work I remember I 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.760
 had a first digital camera that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.899
 It came out that I wore. I wore the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.990
 magazine time with her - day - definition 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.409
 What is this then with this camera have 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.720
 professional certainty can take photos 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.330
 whatever he wants to use it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.759
 professionally it does not impress 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.189
 arrive in a place lewis appears with this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.479
 What machine does he speak good? 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.400
 Photograph 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 roth in waiting to see the result of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.090
 your name is right 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.329
 but the quality of it is I do not see myself 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.780
 I see this machine with a machine that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.259
 killed all the amateur cameras in the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 market the suggested price is 2,999 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.070
 for models with 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 plastic and three thousand and ninety nine 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.899
 devices for rear-mounted 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.270
 leather and here in the event besides the g4 were 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.590
 presented these other two models 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 intermediates 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 g4 beach and g 4 styles templates 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.860
 have a simpler configuration if 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 compared to g4 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.009
 already the design follows the same style but 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 have some differences 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.009
 mainly in the question is the size 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.830
 we have the idea of ​​starting from the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.510
 g4 core than product brings theme 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.410
 and visual identity as well as the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.500
 main 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.630
 but there are direct benefits of the user 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.430
 portals is this feature these 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.240
 features both for the product 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.580
 smaller 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.740
 there is good and substantial portion 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.890
 of users who wants performance is a 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.570
 product with top performance or 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.550
 next but do not want to load 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.100
 a very big device for that 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.630
 fits perfectly the g4 beach that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.330
 is a product 100 points two inches 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.160
 with screen full hd processor occhetta 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.980
 rope then performance terms do not 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.720
 there should absolutely be nothing there 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 very interesting camera experience 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.460
 has a 3 megapixel rear with the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.380
 collegiate same g3 system plus one 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.780
 front of 5 with all our 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.880
 resources and sky so here it already means 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.340
 which is to define well what is the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.590
 the product proposal much of what g3 did 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.780
 g 4 is actually doing these 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.800
 products what they are in a version 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.200
 more compact 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.930
 already the 4 styles g is the opposite in this 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.700
 meaning it is a fuse is a product 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.770
 for those who like the device do not want a 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.780
 big screen here I want to drop my 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.310
 book my next agenda and to 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.020
 college or a meeting in my 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.940
 work as smartphone a pen 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.970
 stylus note all it's intended 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.820
 mainly kutahya 5.7 with a screen 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.490
 hd plus a battery of 3 milan loses one 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.320
 device for you to use long before 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.050
 have to reload in two 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.930
 4g versions one that brings a quad core of 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.400
 Anything is 3g with HDTV as well 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.950
 interesting also by the screen size 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.380
 of the product it brings an ok from the rope to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.300
 mediatek the devices does not have a 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.890
 launch forecast but you can already have 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.180
 a price estimate 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.660
 we still do not have a definition 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.830
 clear and hopefully ours can 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.450
 undergo changes 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.430
 we believe it will run around 1 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.989
 499 for both 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.300
 and there really will differentiate the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.130
 question of what channels another product 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.440
 will be available to anyone who wants a 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.810
 Watch with classic style at LG 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.180
 brought to Brazil the great for good 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.970
 the configuration is similar to gil find 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.459
 a lg sports model in the case of good 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.620
 It features metal trim and bracelet 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.560
 leather for review
