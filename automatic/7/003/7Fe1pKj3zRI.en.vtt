you want to rate this one we also need
to<00:00:48.690> start<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.440> Apache<00:00:49.980> web<00:00:50.550> server<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.230> point

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
to start an Apache web server and point

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
to start an Apache web server and point
the<00:00:52.469> document<00:00:52.949> root<00:00:53.129> folder<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.000> blender

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the document root folder to the blender

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.310 
the document root folder to the blender
folder<00:00:55.190> i'm<00:00:56.190> using<00:00:56.399> MAMP<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> simple

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
folder i'm using MAMP which is a simple

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.420 
folder i'm using MAMP which is a simple
way<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.070> macbook<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.699> start<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> things

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
way on this macbook to start the things

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.940 
way on this macbook to start the things
so<00:01:02.430> let's<00:01:02.609> choose<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.180> route<00:01:05.570> blender<00:01:06.570> ok

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.130 

wait<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.119> server<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.330> restart<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:15.600> we

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
wait for server to restart and then we

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.850 
wait for server to restart and then we
can<00:01:16.350> start<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> new<00:01:17.340> tab<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> point<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
can start a new tab and point to the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
can start a new tab and point to the
local<00:01:19.860> host<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.400> installation<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.240> need

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
local host in this installation you need

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.170 
local host in this installation you need
to<00:01:24.570> make<00:01:24.720> sure<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.180> database

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
to make sure that you have a database

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.830 
to make sure that you have a database
username<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.080> password<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.250> access

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
username and password that can access

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.310 
username and password that can access
the<00:01:30.840> server<00:01:32.360> locally<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.600> also<00:01:33.659> through

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the server locally but also through

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
the server locally but also through
remotely<00:01:35.100> through<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> network<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
remotely through the network so I'm just

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.560 
remotely through the network so I'm just
checking<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.579> adding<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.060> user<00:01:42.090> called

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
checking so I'm adding a user called

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.760 
checking so I'm adding a user called
Brenda<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.399> with<00:01:44.399> Brenda<00:01:44.880> password<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
Brenda with with Brenda password and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
Brenda with with Brenda password and
that<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.979> access<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.549> everywhere<00:01:50.090> going<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that can access from everywhere going to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.819 
that can access from everywhere going to
enter<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> IP<00:01:52.079> address<00:01:52.610> did<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.759> before<00:01:54.829> using

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
enter the IP address did it before using

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.330 
enter the IP address did it before using
the<00:01:56.100> special<00:01:56.610> port<00:01:57.030> number<00:01:57.360> from<00:01:57.540> map<00:01:58.340> but

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the special port number from map but

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.660 
the special port number from map but
usually<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.119> leave<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.670> render

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
usually you can leave it as is render

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.559 
usually you can leave it as is render
render<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.460> install

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.350 

now<00:02:08.800> everything<00:02:09.800> seems<00:02:09.979> fine<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.670> let's<00:02:11.120> go<00:02:11.300> to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
seems working what we need is to check

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.940 
seems working what we need is to check
why<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.340> looks<00:02:22.550> dead<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.560> fact<00:02:24.800> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
why it looks dead and it's in fact that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.460 
why it looks dead and it's in fact that
this<00:02:25.069> server<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.520> not<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.750> web<00:02:27.050> server<00:02:27.260> is

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
this server is not the web server is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.920 
this server is not the web server is
running<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.130> blender<00:02:28.520> server<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.750> one

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
running but the blender server the one

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.750 
running but the blender server the one
that<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.590> dispatch<00:02:30.980> all<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> orders

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
that is going to dispatch all the orders

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.390 
that is going to dispatch all the orders
the<00:02:31.970> jobs<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.020> things<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.709> not

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
the jobs and the things to do is not

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.930 
the jobs and the things to do is not
running<00:02:34.670> yet<00:02:35.290> what<00:02:36.290> we<00:02:36.440> need<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.709> do<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.069> go<00:02:37.880> to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
running yet what we need to do is go to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.030 
running yet what we need to do is go to
a<00:02:38.120> terminal<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.890> enter<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.590> same<00:02:42.590> folder

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
a terminal and enter to the same folder

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.300 
a terminal and enter to the same folder
so<00:02:43.400> that's<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:44.420> think<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.900> my<00:02:45.050> desktop<00:02:46.000> glenda

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
so that's I think on my desktop glenda

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.120 
so that's I think on my desktop glenda
download<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.550> start<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.840> server<00:02:51.080> we<00:02:51.709> start

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
download and start the server we start

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.870 
download and start the server we start
the<00:02:52.370> server<00:02:52.640> by<00:02:53.090> typing<00:02:53.920> PHP<00:02:55.060> render<00:02:56.060> server

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the server by typing PHP render server

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.660 
the server by typing PHP render server
so<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.120> server<00:02:59.480> started<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.489> see

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
so now the server started we can see

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.410 
so now the server started we can see
that<00:03:02.350> he's<00:03:03.350> trying<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.100> delete<00:03:04.370> all<00:03:04.610> orders

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.240 
and just having random numbers that's
just<00:03:08.360> too<00:03:08.540> saying<00:03:08.780> he's<00:03:09.590> alive<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:09.950> doing

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.330 
just too saying he's alive and doing
things<00:03:10.660> let's<00:03:11.660> go<00:03:11.810> there<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.860> refresh

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340

is gone so the server is running fine we

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.720 
is gone so the server is running fine we
now<00:03:20.090> need<00:03:20.329> some<00:03:20.690> clients<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:22.070> add<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.250> clients
