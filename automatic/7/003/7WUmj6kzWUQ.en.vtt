be able to get a little bit more
experience<00:01:24.840> per<00:01:25.140> hour<00:01:25.320> i<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.549> use

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
experience per hour i think if we do use

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
experience per hour i think if we do use
the<00:01:26.880> best<00:01:27.119> armor<00:01:27.450> possible<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.380> could<00:01:28.590> get

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the best armor possible you could get

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.819 
the best armor possible you could get
around<00:01:29.100> 450<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.329> 500,000<00:01:31.259> experience

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
around 450 to around 500,000 experience

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
around 450 to around 500,000 experience
per<00:01:31.979> hour<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.880> obviously<00:01:33.240> remember<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
per hour but obviously remember that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.719 
per hour but obviously remember that
does<00:01:33.930> include<00:01:34.310> constitution<00:01:35.310> experience

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
does include constitution experience

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.109 
does include constitution experience
also<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.950> they<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.009> both<00:01:38.189> added<00:01:38.579> together<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
also so they are both added together to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.530 
also so they are both added together to
get<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> total<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:40.020> around<00:01:40.549> 400,000<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
get a total of around 400,000 what I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.139 
get a total of around 400,000 what I
usually<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.470> 10<00:01:44.130> minutes<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
usually do is I do 10 minutes of a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.840 
usually do is I do 10 minutes of a
combat<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.380> times<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> by<00:01:46.829> six<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.729> at
