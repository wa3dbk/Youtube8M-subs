00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
diapers that can be reused so once you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.960 
diapers that can be reused so once you
have<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.830> recommend<00:02:55.830> placing<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.760> rubber

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
have this I recommend placing a rubber

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.410 
have this I recommend placing a rubber
band<00:02:57.270> over<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.950> pillow<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.610> bassinet<00:03:00.150> body

band over the pillow and bassinet body

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.260 
band over the pillow and bassinet body
to<00:03:01.170> help<00:03:01.560> hold<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:02.040> together<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.090> when

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
to help hold it together so that when

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.820 
to help hold it together so that when
you<00:03:03.390> pick<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.720> up<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.990> doesn't<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.560> fall

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
you pick it up it doesn't just fall

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.180
