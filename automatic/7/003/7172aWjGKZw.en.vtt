sit<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.180> top<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.290> hot<00:01:27.470> that

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
sit on top of that that it's so hot that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.490 
sit on top of that that it's so hot that
the<00:01:27.920> concrete<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.640> structurally<00:01:29.500> falling

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the concrete is structurally falling

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.050 
the concrete is structurally falling
apart<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:31.190> there<00:01:31.369> are<00:01:31.460> big<00:01:31.580> chunks<00:01:31.940> of

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
apart that there are big chunks of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.530 
apart that there are big chunks of
concrete<00:01:32.659> falling<00:01:33.200> right<00:01:33.470> off<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.710> ceiling

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
onto the burning vehicles and the road

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.310 
onto the burning vehicles and the road
so<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:39.770> said<00:01:40.039> that<00:01:40.190> that's<00:01:40.750> such<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.780> hazard<00:01:42.229> on

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
so we said that that's such a hazard on

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.010 
so we said that that's such a hazard on
top<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.800> everything<00:01:42.920> else<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.720> they<00:01:44.840> don't

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
top of everything else and they don't

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.669 
top of everything else and they don't
really<00:01:45.229> know<00:01:45.440> what<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.710> do<00:01:45.830> quite<00:01:46.070> yet<00:01:47.679> except

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
really know what to do quite yet except

00:01:48.679 --> 00:02:05.640 
really know what to do quite yet except
wait<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.450> let<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.570> burn<00:01:50.720> itself<00:01:50.899> out

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.510 

it's<00:02:05.980> quite<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.280> accident<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.870> shows<00:02:08.080> how

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's quite the accident this shows how

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's quite the accident this shows how
really<00:02:09.520> traffic<00:02:10.000> locked<00:02:10.240> Santa<00:02:10.690> Clarita<00:02:10.869> gets

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
really traffic locked Santa Clarita gets

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.890 
really traffic locked Santa Clarita gets
if<00:02:11.710> there's<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.130> bad<00:02:12.400> accident<00:02:12.430> or<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.780> the
