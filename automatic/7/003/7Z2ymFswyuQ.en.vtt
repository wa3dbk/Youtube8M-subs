okay<00:00:22.300> we<00:00:22.420> have<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.570> weap<00:00:22.810> back<00:00:23.020> penny<00:00:23.289> they're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
okay we have a weap back penny they're

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.730 
okay we have a weap back penny they're
surrounded<00:00:24.519> by<00:00:24.550> nails<00:00:25.439> zoom<00:00:26.439> out<00:00:26.590> a<00:00:26.650> little

surrounded by nails zoom out a little

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.490 
surrounded by nails zoom out a little
bit<00:00:27.509> let's<00:00:28.509> start<00:00:28.779> out<00:00:28.900> with<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.169> Garrett

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
bit let's start out with the Garrett

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.189 
bit let's start out with the Garrett
eight<00:00:29.710> by<00:00:29.980> five<00:00:30.220> coil<00:00:30.669> and<00:00:30.939> we're<00:00:31.810> in<00:00:31.900> poro

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
eight by five coil and we're in poro

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.510 
eight by five coil and we're in poro
zero<00:00:32.680> full<00:00:33.430> sensitivity<00:00:34.199> and<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:36.370> how<00:00:36.430> this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
zero full sensitivity and see how this

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:46.470 
zero full sensitivity and see how this
responds<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.250> go<00:00:45.400> real<00:00:45.730> slow<00:00:46.150> you<00:00:46.210> hear

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
responds if you go real slow you hear

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:57.299 
responds if you go real slow you hear
blip<00:00:48.839> you<00:00:49.839> go<00:00:49.960> normal<00:00:50.379> swing<00:00:50.650> speed<00:00:56.309> very

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.090 

okay<00:01:08.780> now<00:01:08.990> we're<00:01:09.200> trying<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.829> the<00:01:09.920> same

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
okay now we're trying to the same

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.060 
okay now we're trying to the same

sensitivity<00:01:14.049> we<00:01:15.049> have<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.409> sharp<00:01:15.770> true<00:01:16.009> of

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.070 
sensitivity we have the sharp true of
the<00:01:16.420> Sharpshooter<00:01:17.420> it's<00:01:17.540> called<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.810> snake

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
the Sharpshooter it's called the snake

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.740 
the Sharpshooter it's called the snake
coil<00:01:18.409> there's<00:01:19.399> actually<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.729> size<00:01:20.299> down<00:01:20.570> from

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
coil there's actually a size down from

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.990 
coil there's actually a size down from
the<00:01:20.840> Sharpshooter<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.610> three<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:22.909> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the Sharpshooter this is three and a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.779 
the Sharpshooter this is three and a
half<00:01:23.090> inches<00:01:23.450> by<00:01:23.600> six<00:01:23.930> inches<00:01:24.079> and<00:01:24.670> let's<00:01:25.670> see

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
half inches by six inches and let's see

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.820 
half inches by six inches and let's see
how<00:01:25.909> it<00:01:25.939> does<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:27.229> this<00:01:27.409> week<00:01:27.619> back

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
how it does with this week back

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:40.990 
how it does with this week back
surrounded<00:01:28.640> by<00:01:28.729> iron<00:01:39.310> even<00:01:40.310> had<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.429> good<00:01:40.700> sweep

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
surrounded by iron even had a good sweep

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:52.480 
surrounded by iron even had a good sweep
speed<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:45.740> hear<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> sounding<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:52.310> real

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
speed you hear a sounding going real

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:03.490 
speed you hear a sounding going real
slow<00:02:01.390> no<00:02:02.390> problem<00:02:02.780> picking<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.229> between

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
slow no problem picking that up between

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.740 
slow no problem picking that up between
the<00:02:03.740> nails<00:02:09.910> another<00:02:10.910> thing<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.330> liked<00:02:11.599> about

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the nails another thing I liked about

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.310 
the nails another thing I liked about
this<00:02:12.190> was<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.370> sensitivity<00:02:14.359> the<00:02:14.390> actual

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
this was the sensitivity the actual

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.630 
this was the sensitivity the actual
depth<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.890> for<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> coil<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.370> size

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
depth on it it's a for a coil this size

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.729 
depth on it it's a for a coil this size
you<00:02:20.209> zoom<00:02:20.390> out<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.540> little<00:02:20.630> bit<00:02:22.959> for<00:02:23.959> coal<00:02:24.560> this

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
you zoom out a little bit for coal this

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:34.360 
you zoom out a little bit for coal this
