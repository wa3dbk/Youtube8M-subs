 "Aromatherapy with Orange Essential Oil for Anxiety" 

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.599
 Aromatherapy is the use of concentrated essential oils 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.125
 derived from plants to treat the disease. 

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:18.317
 They are commonly used to treat anxiety symptoms. 

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:22.139
 Anxiety disorders are the most common type 

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:24.903
 mental disorders among the general population. 

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:27.787
 However, their treatment is still a challenge for us. 

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:31.468
 Drugs used to relieve anxiety symptoms 

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.547
 they may have serious side effects. 

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.870
 Fortunately, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trials 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.709
 assessing the effects of essential oils on anxiety symptoms 

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:45.815
 are gradually beginning to appear in medical literature. 

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:47.346
 However, in most of these studies 

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:51.716
 exposure to the scent of essential oils was accompanied by massage. 

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.388
 This makes it hard to draw firm conclusions 

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.145
 about the effects of the scent itself. 

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:59.126
 Here is a typical example. 

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:03.022
 Patient in intensive care unit day after heart surgery 

00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:07.543
 he got a foot massage with scented orange oil. 

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:09.853
 Why not back massage? 

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:13.211
 Because they opened his chest in the operating room a moment ago 

00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:16.225
 and now has a big sternotomy wound. 

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:20.787
 Perhaps plant diet would be a better choice 

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:23.874
 than herbal massage after surgery. 

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:27.163
 But after the massage, people felt great, relaxed, peaceful and calm. 

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:31.716
 This is a British study; after all, one person described the effect as "sensational." 

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.789
 How do we know, however, whether essential oil has any connection with it? 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.926
 Maybe it was just a massage that was so damn good. 

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.950
 In that case, great, give people a massage. 

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:42.900
 I definitely agree with extending foot massages to intensive care units. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.780
 Randomized studies provide us with substantial evidence that 

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.710
 that the massage itself reduces anxiety. 

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:53.710
 When the massage is effective, aromatherapy massage is also effective. 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.630
 So aromatherapy can work even if it does nothing. 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.300
 However, one study was conducted in patients with cancer 

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.580
 massages during chemotherapy and radiation. 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.440
 This study found that a fragrance-free massage can be even more effective. 

00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:10.340
 It occurred to them that it might be some kind of negative Pavlov's reflex. 

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:12.220
 People felt citrus and their body said: 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.160
 "Oh no, another cancer treatment." 

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:19.560
 A more recent study examined the light scent of orange 

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:23.670
 at dentist. They wanted to see if the smell would ease anxiety and improve people's mood. 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.350
 The fine orange scent was scattered into the air in the waiting room. 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.150
 Indeed, she seemed to have a relaxing effect, people were not so anxious, had a better mood 

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:35.310
 and they were quieter than a control group that had no smell in the waiting room. 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.080
 However, they did not have a completely neutral atmosphere, they could feel the typical and unpleasant smell of the surgery. 

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:43.240
 It is possible that the orange smell simply masked the unpleasant smell. 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.720
 Perhaps the effect had nothing to do with any ingredient of orange essential oil. 

00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:49.720
 Further research was needed. 

00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:53.960
 "The effect of sweet orange scent in experimental anxiety in humans." 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.440
 They have exposed several university graduates to a situation that is causing anxiety 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.720
 and tested the effects of orange scent, other scents, and no scents. 

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:08.750
 The orange scent seemed to have an anti-anxiety effect. 

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:12.500
 Interestingly, the anti-anxiety effects 

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.360
 they were not accompanied by any physical or mental damping. 

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:18.030
 On the contrary, at the highest dose of orange oil 

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.750
 volunteers felt more energetic. 

00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:24.830
 So theoretically, feelings of anxiety can be alleviated, 

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:26.590
 without the dampening effects of drugs like Valium. 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.790
 Does this mean that we can get benefits without side effects? 

00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:33.510
 I have already talked about the concerns 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.830
 the use of fragrance consumer products, even those on the natural basis. 

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:41.940
 Side effects of aromatherapy have been reported. 

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:44.500
 They were even quite serious reactions. 

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:49.080
 Alternative medicine may not be risk-free. 

00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:52.350
 There are dozens of people, for example, 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.430
 the acupuncture needle into the heart. 

00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:58.800
 Au! 

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.520
 However, the undesirable effects of aromatherapy were mostly only in the irritated skin 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.750
 when applying essential oils to the skin, 

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:08.630
 or worse, as a result of their swallowing. 

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:13.510
 Some citrus oils can make our skin sensitive to the sun. 

00:04:13.513 --> 00:04:16.900
 This is obviously not such a big deal in France 

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:23.550
 whose inhabitants are known to apply essential oils where the sun never shines ...
