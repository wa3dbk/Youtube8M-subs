down<00:06:00.470> like<00:06:00.740> i<00:06:00.860> said<00:06:01.069> it's<00:06:01.520> basically<00:06:02.030> just

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
down like i said it's basically just

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.550

just what you want it how you want it to

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.439 
just what you want it how you want it to

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
look like my Luck's better health is I

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.629 
look like my Luck's better health is I
didn't<00:06:09.020> know<00:06:09.110> a<00:06:09.169> lot

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
didn't know a lot

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.200 
didn't know a lot
but<00:06:10.270> that's<00:06:10.449> pretty<00:06:10.599> much<00:06:10.840> how<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.080> do<00:06:11.289> it<00:06:12.210> and

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
but that's pretty much how you do it and

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.580 
but that's pretty much how you do it and
from<00:06:13.539> the<00:06:13.659> back<00:06:13.810> it's<00:06:14.139> going<00:06:14.319> to<00:06:14.409> look<00:06:14.499> weird

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
from the back it's going to look weird

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.990 
from the back it's going to look weird
if<00:06:14.800> you<00:06:14.830> just<00:06:15.069> do<00:06:15.189> one<00:06:15.430> layer<00:06:15.610> like<00:06:15.789> this<00:06:15.939> one

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.480 

that's<00:06:19.570> why<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:19.870> do<00:06:20.200> all<00:06:20.560> of<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.890> and<00:06:21.220> then<00:06:21.370> you

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
that's why you do all of it and then you

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.820 
that's why you do all of it and then you
just<00:06:21.670> click<00:06:21.790> and<00:06:22.030> workout<00:06:22.810> in<00:06:23.080> with<00:06:23.530> at<00:06:23.650> what

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
just click and workout in with at what

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.010 
just click and workout in with at what
not<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:24.280> then<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:25.030> an<00:06:25.210> interesting<00:06:25.660> you're

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
not and then it an interesting you're

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.890 
not and then it an interesting you're
starting<00:06:26.140> with<00:06:26.290> that<00:06:26.410> to<00:06:27.190> make<00:06:27.340> it<00:06:27.490> bigger

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
starting with that to make it bigger

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.730 
starting with that to make it bigger
just<00:06:28.900> tease<00:06:29.110> one<00:06:30.870> that's<00:06:31.870> pretty<00:06:32.080> much<00:06:32.260> it

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.610
