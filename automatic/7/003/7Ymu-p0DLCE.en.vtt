00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello everyone rusalin with you we're with you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.929
 video channel which is dedicated to modeling of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 polymer clay 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.230
 today's master class we will 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 create a cane again but it will 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.840
 cane with the image of Kiev in the section 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.480
 i will show you my quick and easy 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.130
 way to create this movie for work 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.640
 you will need polymer clay 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 black brown lime green 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 white blades and rolling pin or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 I placed the pasta machine with plastic 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.960
 green light green white created from 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.989
 they are identical in size with squares 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.649
 using a blade, I cut 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.420
 the parts we don't need and put these 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.930
 obtained triangles diagonally 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 each other in this way so that green and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.629
 white colors were out and lime 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.039
 and inside a new class now i'm 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 we roll these layers 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.630
 first with a rolling pin and then using 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.510
 pasta machine and smooth layer 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 the color transition is already this layer I 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.450
 turn off four times and miss 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.159
 between the rollers late machine 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.560
 thickness between the rollers while 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.430
 is 3 millimeters 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 here's the long strip I got 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 I stack on the work surface and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.670
 now using black polymer clay 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.960
 I will do imitation of sunflower seeds 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 already inside the future canes for this i 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.399
 I take black polymer clay mark 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.579
 hands and form from it a thin strip 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.960
 on a white surface 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:54.090
 laying down first two thin strips and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.690
 now layer by layer I will 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.299
 fold this tape accordion but on 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.640
 each new layer I will impose 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:08.700
 one or two black stripes then i 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.690
 flip the tape lay a layer on 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.620
 previous 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.260
 and again we lay down one door and black 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.000
 the strips revert the ribbon and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.750
 I wrap the next layer overlaying 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.299
 him again black stripes so i 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.900
 keep on putting black stripes up 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:34.079
 mid-range with a light green tint 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.459
 clay remaining gap from Saratov 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:41.190
 clay green dollars i will do 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.829
 coups tape put her accordion 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.430
 but in each such fold Iâ€™ll be 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.660
 to lay 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.470
 not 2 black strips on one and reaching 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.870
 until green I stop laying 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.799
 black stripes that mimic the seeds 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.980
 and just further green plastic I 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.799
 I'll just fold up the harmonica 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.690
 overlaying each other without 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.690
 any additions and blotches 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.660
 the cane with fastenings we have created 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 now i'm preparing a layer was 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.030
 polymer clay with a thickness of 3 millimeters 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.840
 this white layer will need to wrap 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.440
 the cane is half that is from the middle 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.620
 light green from the right edge to 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.739
 mid light green color from the left edge 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.290
 we wrap the cane white layer shape 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.120
 horseshoes 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.610
 now the resulting cane will need 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.730
 squeeze and squeeze the middle of the cane and 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.400
 smooth moving to and at the edge and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.680
 roll up to length given what i can 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.160
 tie che uneven ending to that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.360
 lengths 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:04.090
 which is divided exactly into 12 parts 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.120
 that is, we roll a cane let's say 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.190
 up to 24 centimeters long and divide it by 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.930
 small pieces of checks two centimeters 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.930
 in the amount of 12 pieces 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.690
 now each of these little reeds 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.730
 by the bell color we will have to 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.780
 pinch each stick 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.280
 must now have a teardrop shape and 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.389
 now from these little reeds we 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.160
 we start to make 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:48.280
 big ki with a picture of a kiwi in the cut 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.250
 all these canes we stack each other 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.820
 so that the white color 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.820
 The center of the new cable was connected 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.720
 when we connect all 12 elements we 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.060
 see that inside this cane and we 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.490
 formed void which we 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.169
 must fill in white polymer clay 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.210
 that is, we form white plastic 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.090
 cane 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.139
 customizable in width and height our 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.469
 white green canes and insert white 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.620
 core inside cane cane after 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:34.440
 this we close and take plastic 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.440
 green color roll it in 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.539
 thin strip and this thin strip 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.669
 we fill all the gaps between 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.080
 small canes 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.000
 now i am preparing the boards green 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.719
 polymer clay rolled on the post 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.610
 machine is 3 millimeters thick and 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.810
 wrap our cane with its tail 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.810
 imitating cyril 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.840
 and the last final layer will be 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.849
 consist of brown plastic it 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.139
 also post 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:11.520
 prepare layer 2 thick 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.900
 millimeter and this layer we wrap 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.599
 there was a green cane 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:21.470
 after that the stick will need to be pressed and 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.470
 roll to the diameter you need 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.550
 such cane can be stored for half a year if 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.950
 wrap in cling film 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:08.260
 either use immediately as intended 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.190
 after compiling it, I hope this is easy 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.950
 easy way 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:15.940
 will find the response of your hearts and your hands 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:18.160
 will want to repeat and create amazing 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.980
 decoration with the use of this cane 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.780
 with you was rusalin subscribe to 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.970
 my video channel ahead will be still very 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.060
 many interesting but today all 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.060
 until
