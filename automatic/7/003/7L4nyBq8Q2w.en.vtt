00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.730
 the sports friends I am for you today 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 come back with an ingenious exercise for 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.619
 Rather, poor areas for the recipes 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.690
 last time the triceps shows today show 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.460
 I give you little intensity again 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.590
 Technique in the biceps correctly 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 bursts and this exercise is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.300
 just for those or those 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 The problems have strong arm 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 build up or slope biceps 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 build 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 Moreover, dementia is improved 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
 power and that might like that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 for example to your pulse or if their 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 biceps and what integrated at the end of the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 training a word but you can do it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.399
 also perfectly easy to have at home 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.840
 we have super adjustable acting he has 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.890
 then it weighed a little bit 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.420
 It does not have to be that hard 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.129
 and then the channels can already 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.530
 the whole thing starts to work and me 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.960
 say consciously wearing a challenge 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 challenge himself I show you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 now and indeed have two here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.910
 beautiful clumsily I have now 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.450
 here in the case times the 14 kilo we 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.980
 can be around 12 else 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.860
 may present he draws as 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.360
 For the first time the shoulder blades 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.430
 tuition back upright posture 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 and then we start 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.500
 to have a repeat here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.650
 Adapts the same with the other 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:29.090
 Now , page two can be repeated 12 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.090
 and right after that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.259
 catch her on the arm with the states now 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.369
 is coming up with a million now 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.799
 loses the weak arm to adapt 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:52.659
 3 focus on each one 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:52.659
 biceps 23 now we have 4 1 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.329
 2 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.259
 3 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.760
 a little bit for four years 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.760
 burn 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.920
 ok so apart from that you can do that now 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 ultimately, and finally, continue to spin up 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.310
 to sprint right up to then begins too 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.880
 burst 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.540
 and now just like I said with 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.850
 the strong poor at a repetition 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.040
 It's up to many to do 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.360
 repetitions as it goes and then 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.240
 he tastes it all with yours 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.140
 weak but so weaker to 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.300
 adapt and this rehearsal 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.320
 to refill and then I can 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.420
 actually guarantee you 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.810
 I definitely there something in the bicep 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.580
 does 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.020
 also really focus here 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.750
 the vice with joy to swing 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.350
 work that is a pure one 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.630
 Concentration exercises executed here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.980
 and in that sense I say goodbye 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.030
 See you next time if you 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.290
 perhaps other intensity 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 techniques so strong trainings of 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.650
 want to see me then write me down 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.870
 times in the comments are enough for which 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.150
 muscle groups let me show a little 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.659
 the subscribed main channel 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.659
 next time
