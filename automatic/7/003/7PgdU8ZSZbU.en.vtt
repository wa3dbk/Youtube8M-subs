vigorously<00:01:47.000> growing<00:01:47.539> up<00:01:47.799> actually<00:01:48.799> could

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
vigorously growing up actually could

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.289 
vigorously growing up actually could
have<00:01:49.280> made<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.399> little<00:01:49.579> bit<00:01:49.789> higher<00:01:50.030> because

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
have made a little bit higher because

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.510 
have made a little bit higher because
