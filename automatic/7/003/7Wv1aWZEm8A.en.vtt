Hammond organ sound and I went into the
software<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.590> one<00:02:23.769> it's<00:02:23.920> very<00:02:23.980> easy

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
software with this one it's very easy

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.699 
software with this one it's very easy
and<00:02:24.670> I'm<00:02:25.120> sure<00:02:25.450> you'll<00:02:25.660> find<00:02:25.690> out<00:02:26.170> how<00:02:26.349> as<00:02:26.560> well

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
and I'm sure you'll find out how as well

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.259 
and I'm sure you'll find out how as well
when<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.040> pick<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.400> up<00:02:27.580> for<00:02:27.760> yourself<00:02:27.849> to

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
when you pick this up for yourself to

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.990 
when you pick this up for yourself to
just<00:02:28.420> add<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.050> few<00:02:29.319> tweaks<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.099> EQ<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
just add a few tweaks to the EQ and I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.520 
just add a few tweaks to the EQ and I
warmed<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.750> little<00:02:31.870> gave<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> little

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
warmed it up a little gave it a little

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.860 
warmed it up a little gave it a little
distortion<00:02:33.099> fuller<00:02:34.000> more<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.390> sort<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.660> deep

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
distortion fuller more that sort of deep

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.690 
distortion fuller more that sort of deep
purple<00:02:35.110> sound<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:35.890> this<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.310> Hammond

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
purple sound there but this is a Hammond

00:02:36.700 --> 00:03:00.479 
purple sound there but this is a Hammond
organ<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:58.829> think<00:02:59.829> that's<00:03:00.010> pretty<00:03:00.190> convincing

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
organ I think that's pretty convincing

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.100 
organ I think that's pretty convincing
sound<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.120> not<00:03:01.239> going<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.450> lie<00:03:01.569> sounds<00:03:01.989> good

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
sound I'm not going to lie sounds good

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.780 
sound I'm not going to lie sounds good
enough<00:03:02.290> for<00:03:02.410> me<00:03:02.530> especially<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:03.220> you're<00:03:03.400> doing

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
enough for me especially if you're doing

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.610 
enough for me especially if you're doing
some<00:03:04.030> home<00:03:04.180> recordings<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.049> layer<00:03:05.380> that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
some home recordings you layer that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.190 
some home recordings you layer that
under<00:03:06.040> something<00:03:06.340> you've<00:03:06.640> recorded<00:03:07.299> analog

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
under something you've recorded analog

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.160 
under something you've recorded analog
or<00:03:08.440> acoustically<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:10.269> beef<00:03:10.480> things<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.989> to

or acoustically to to beef things up to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.170 
or acoustically to to beef things up to
fatten<00:03:11.500> things<00:03:11.709> up<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.190> think<00:03:12.730> that's<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.970> pretty

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
fatten things up I think that's a pretty

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.729 
fatten things up I think that's a pretty
pretty<00:03:13.569> good<00:03:13.750> sound<00:03:14.019> pretty<00:03:14.260> convincing

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
low E string down to D so I get a big

low E string down to D so I get a big
drop<00:04:34.050> D<00:04:34.260> which<00:04:34.500> makes<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.130> entire<00:04:35.370> sound<00:04:35.850> a

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
drop D which makes this entire sound a

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:57.850 
drop D which makes this entire sound a
little<00:04:37.110> more<00:04:37.230> recognizable

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
like you saw I did do a little alternate

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.360 
like you saw I did do a little alternate
tuning<00:05:24.570> on<00:05:24.660> one<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.139> have<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.590> little<00:05:25.860> gain<00:05:26.070> to

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
another so you've taken 140 sounds and

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.439 
another so you've taken 140 sounds and
by<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.010> time<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:29.430> can<00:05:29.610> get<00:05:29.789> into<00:05:30.060> them<00:05:30.180> and

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
adjust them it's literally infinite all

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.960 
adjust them it's literally infinite all
together<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.710> one<00:05:34.740> package<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:35.430> forget<00:05:35.940> the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970
