mirrors camera so you can see directly

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
mirrors camera so you can see directly
into<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.890> sensor

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
into the sensor

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
into the sensor
yeah<00:00:32.640> that's<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:32.969> aps-c<00:00:33.420> size<00:00:33.780> sensor<00:00:33.809> okay

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
yeah that's an aps-c size sensor okay

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.580 
yeah that's an aps-c size sensor okay
cool<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.480> entire<00:00:36.750> NEX<00:00:37.079> line<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.440> far

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
cool so they the entire NEX line so far

cool so they the entire NEX line so far
has<00:00:37.739> been<00:00:37.770> aps-c<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.910> well<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.050> big

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
has been aps-c as well so that's as big

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.530 
has been aps-c as well so that's as big
as<00:00:40.379> some<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.280> Alpha<00:00:41.579> DSLRs<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.360> some

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
as some of the the Alpha DSLRs and some

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.619 
as some of the the Alpha DSLRs and some
body<00:00:42.989> stuff<00:00:43.079> very<00:00:43.860> cool<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.390> changed

body stuff very cool so what has changed
about<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> f3<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> c3<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
about the f3 from the c3 so a lot of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
about the f3 from the c3 so a lot of
core<00:00:48.809> technology<00:00:49.379> has<00:00:49.530> changed<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
core technology has changed the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.209 
core technology has changed the
resolution<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.510> maintained<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> 16<00:00:53.100> point

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
resolution is maintained it's a 16 point

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.760 
resolution is maintained it's a 16 point
1<00:00:53.430> megapixel<00:00:53.789> image<00:00:54.239> sensor<00:00:54.270> okay<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.199> it's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
1 megapixel image sensor okay but it's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
1 megapixel image sensor okay but it's
combined<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> latest<00:00:56.730> video<00:00:57.180> processor

oh very cool so now you're able to shoot
in<00:01:02.520> very<00:01:02.969> low<00:01:03.149> light<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.840> max<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.580> 16,000<00:01:05.580> Wow

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
in very low light the max is 16,000 Wow

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
in very low light the max is 16,000 Wow
what<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> max<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> c3<00:01:08.070> that's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
what was the max on the on the c3 that's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
what was the max on the on the c3 that's
a<00:01:08.520> twelve<00:01:08.850> thousand<00:01:09.180> eight<00:01:09.270> hundred<00:01:09.450> okay<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
improved sensor and probably means that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770 
improved sensor and probably means that
there<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.939> new<00:01:18.030> video<00:01:18.270> stuff<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
yeah so with the new processor now we

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.620 
yeah so with the new processor now we
have<00:01:21.360> full<00:01:22.290> HD<00:01:22.740> 1080<00:01:23.280> 60<00:01:23.610> eye<00:01:23.880> video<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> also

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

about<00:03:52.170> battery<00:03:52.620> life<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.459> one<00:03:53.670> you've

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
about battery life on this one you've

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.069 
about battery life on this one you've
added<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.120> lot<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.299> new<00:03:54.390> stuff<00:03:54.690> how<00:03:54.870> does<00:03:54.989> that

added a lot of new stuff how does that
affect<00:03:55.350> battery<00:03:55.530> life<00:03:55.860> yes<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
affect battery life yes so now the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.660 
affect battery life yes so now the
electronics<00:03:57.780> are<00:03:57.900> completely<00:03:58.470> new<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.100> from

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
electronics are completely new so from

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.850 
electronics are completely new so from

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
the still image inside okay cool so what

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.480 
the still image inside okay cool so what
are<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.050> differences<00:04:49.290> between<00:04:49.410> between<00:04:50.370> this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
are the differences between between this

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.520 
are the differences between between this
lens<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.360> older<00:04:51.630> 18<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.050> 200<00:04:52.470> an

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
lens and the in the older 18 to 200 an

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.920 
lens and the in the older 18 to 200 an
older<00:04:52.830> 18-200<00:04:53.370> lens<00:04:53.790> is<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.120> kit<00:04:54.300> lens<00:04:54.330> for

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
older 18-200 lens is the kit lens for

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.820 
older 18-200 lens is the kit lens for
the<00:04:55.230> VZ<00:04:56.330> 1020<00:04:57.330> okay<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:57.960> that's<00:04:58.200> really<00:04:58.530> meant

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
the VZ 1020 okay and that's really meant

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.250 
the VZ 1020 okay and that's really meant
for<00:04:58.950> video<00:04:59.550> usage<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.390> one<00:05:00.600> if<00:05:01.050> you're<00:05:01.230> a
