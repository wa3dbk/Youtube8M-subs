00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
smaller portion now these numbers were

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.950 
smaller portion now these numbers were

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
silver at eight and change so they don't

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.820 
silver at eight and change so they don't
always<00:06:07.340> work<00:06:08.120> together<00:06:08.590> exactly<00:06:09.590> so<00:06:09.710> it's

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
always work together exactly so it's

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.610 
always work together exactly so it's
interestingly<00:06:10.130> enough<00:06:11.080> that<00:06:12.080> when<00:06:12.230> gold<00:06:12.470> and

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
interestingly enough that when gold and

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.170 
interestingly enough that when gold and
silver<00:06:12.919> bottoms<00:06:13.400> at<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.610> end<00:06:13.760> of<00:06:13.880> o<00:06:13.970> eight

silver bottoms at the end of o eight

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.920 
silver bottoms at the end of o eight
that<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:15.020> top<00:06:15.260> dollar<00:06:15.590> did<00:06:15.890> not<00:06:16.160> talk<00:06:16.930> however

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
that the top dollar did not talk however

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.190 
that the top dollar did not talk however
given<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:18.530> said<00:06:19.090> right<00:06:20.090> now<00:06:20.330> we<00:06:20.390> are<00:06:20.750> shade

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
given that said right now we are shade

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.560 
given that said right now we are shade
below<00:06:21.410> eighty<00:06:21.800> seventy<00:06:22.640> eight<00:06:22.880> or<00:06:23.090> so<00:06:23.330> I<00:06:23.360> think

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
below eighty seventy eight or so I think

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.719 
below eighty seventy eight or so I think
and<00:06:24.820> gold<00:06:25.820> right<00:06:26.150> now<00:06:26.180> is<00:06:26.540> thirteen<00:06:27.200> hundred

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
and gold right now is thirteen hundred

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.090 
and gold right now is thirteen hundred
which<00:06:28.729> is

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
which is

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.570 
which is
higher<00:06:29.160> than<00:06:29.400> this<00:06:30.500> silver<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.620> 22<00:06:32.250> which<00:06:32.550> is

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
higher than this silver is 22 which is

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.720 
higher than this silver is 22 which is
higher<00:06:32.940> that<00:06:32.970> is<00:06:33.210> 21<00:06:33.870> level<00:06:34.290> and<00:06:34.470> what<00:06:35.400> this<00:06:35.550> is

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
higher that is 21 level and what this is

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.960 
higher that is 21 level and what this is
showing<00:06:35.760> is<00:06:36.390> that<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:37.740> manipulation<00:06:38.220> for

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
showing is that the manipulation for

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.450 
showing is that the manipulation for
trying<00:06:39.450> to<00:06:39.600> bring<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.170> prices<00:06:40.500> lower<00:06:41.070> has

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
trying to bring the prices lower has

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.060 
trying to bring the prices lower has
ended<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.210> doesn't<00:06:43.140> mean<00:06:43.230> the<00:06:43.350> manipulation

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
ended that doesn't mean the manipulation

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.590 
ended that doesn't mean the manipulation
to<00:06:44.160> try<00:06:44.370> to<00:06:44.430> keep<00:06:44.820> it<00:06:45.030> lower<00:06:45.210> than<00:06:45.420> what<00:06:45.570> it

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
to try to keep it lower than what it

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.340 
to try to keep it lower than what it
should<00:06:46.050> is<00:06:46.260> not<00:06:46.500> here<00:06:47.810> but<00:06:48.810> from<00:06:49.050> this

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
should is not here but from this

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.580 
should is not here but from this
analysis<00:06:50.010> what<00:06:50.310> I<00:06:50.520> see<00:06:51.030> is<00:06:51.270> that<00:06:51.870> we<00:06:52.080> are<00:06:52.290> only

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
analysis what I see is that we are only

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.920 
analysis what I see is that we are only
starting<00:06:52.980> to<00:06:53.760> get<00:06:54.090> that<00:06:54.360> what<00:06:54.780> was

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
starting to get that what was

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.890 
starting to get that what was
manipulated<00:06:55.740> from<00:06:56.630> 1980<00:06:57.630> to<00:06:58.670> 2001<00:06:59.750> thank<00:07:00.750> you

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
manipulated from 1980 to 2001 thank you

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.790 
manipulated from 1980 to 2001 thank you
for<00:07:01.080> watching<00:07:01.470> how<00:07:01.590> yourself<00:07:02.010> a<00:07:02.190> great<00:07:02.580> day
