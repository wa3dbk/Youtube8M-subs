00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.330
 salmon tagliatelle from norway and 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.520
 smoked salmon with good vodka sauce 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.410
 tagliatelle lies next to me a 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.980
 saucepan with boiling water which boils 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.380
 so we can directly master 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.930
 some good on the box there is 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.830
 scored six minutes of cooking to have 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.870
 something al dente 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.920
 but how exactly will the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.199
 pan cooking 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.449
 I'm going to stop after four 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.390
 minutes a power take care of our 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.590
 splendid norway salmon 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.640
 we are on a product that has 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.229
 developed in cold waters and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.510
 limpid fjords of norway 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:52.460
 I'm going to take off his skin so I have 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.890
 make a small cut and then we 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.559
 is going to be more than just holding the skin is 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:04.489
 lying with my knife well flat of 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:07.340
 way to keep the maximum of flesh so 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.030
 I removed the skin well we are on a 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.950
 farmed fish 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.170
 it is a breeding that respects 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.550
 the environment and the natural cycle of 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.690
 product have produced precisely that is 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.810
 ultra controlled so we have a quality 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.840
 optimum 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.890
 so here I have detailed tape I do 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.500
 looking to make big cubes 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.760
 we go about 1 cm in side actually 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.140
 this is the advantage with the salmon knows 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.830
 we can do it in many ways 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.960
 different 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 there he goes to the stove but he 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.320
 could go to the oven we could 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.260
 do in carpaccio so consume it 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.010
 raw in Tartar there are a thousand and one 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.620
 ways to prepare my paws are 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.010
 very young al dente is refreshed for 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.930
 stop cooking but cubes of salmon 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.560
 from norway are dirty and there for her 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.150
 is hot it means I'm going 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.280
 to make a little circle like that I will know 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.290
 what is the first piece I have 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.790
 filed so when I say ultra cooking 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.429
 fast I'm looking for that without you yet 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.700
 limit raw that's the best of 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.700
 cooking 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:19.859
 here we see it on some tracks 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.969
 we are still almost increased and we have 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.090
 said sosa vodka 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.290
 good so I warn vodka but all the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.700
 world will be able to eat it since I 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.389
 have evaporated all the alcohol that is 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.189
 content so there what is in the process of 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.019
 to evaporate is alcohol so there I 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.560
 seeks to concentrate all the aromas of 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.659
 this vodka 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.370
 I would reduce to two tablespoons 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.530
 soup to break everything that wakes up very 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.250
 quickly afterwards with the cream then 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.090
 now hop the cream 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.609
 on the other hand I'll be able to rpt 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.150
 lower a little bit the fire I'm going 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.579
 then pepper the vodka already this little 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 peppery taste we will insist a little on 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.620
 I'm dirty but I'm going room is very 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.799
 slightly what we will see our other 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.769
 salmon and our smoked salmon that go 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.930
 also bring salty notes to 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.930
 to be able to warm the legs 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.099
 here they started to heat I 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.409
 can I cover them with my cream 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.970
 it will continue to heat up during this 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:29.280
 time there I will quickly cut my salmon 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:32.040
 smoked in thongs i'm going to cut my ass 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.590
 so is the fans going to finish their 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.699
 baking brimming with our sauce at the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.699
 vodka our tubes from this world norway 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:53.990
 smoked salmon from salmon eggs to 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.990
 dill and I mix one last time 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.010
 skates with cub feet of salmon from 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.670
 norway will be added some 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.560
 finally some smoked salmon 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.320
 little eggs on top one last 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.390
 cream spoon to cover all that 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.459

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.459
