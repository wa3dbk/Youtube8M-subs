00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
cooking needs it's solid like this and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
cooking needs it's solid like this and
when<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> apply<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> gets<00:01:40.140> warm<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
when you apply it when it gets warm you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.550 
when you apply it when it gets warm you
know<00:01:40.680> when<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> has<00:01:41.220> heat<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.700> uh<00:01:42.439> see<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
know when it has heat it uh see it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370 
know when it has heat it uh see it
starts<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.070> turn<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.329> liquid<00:01:45.869> form<00:01:45.990> now

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
starts to turn into a liquid form now

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.039 
starts to turn into a liquid form now
since<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.860> oil<00:01:47.299> you<00:01:48.299> may<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
since this is oil you may want to use it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
since this is oil you may want to use it
at<00:01:49.170> night<00:01:49.229> which<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> usually<00:01:50.490> use<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
at night which is when I usually use it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
at night which is when I usually use it
because<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.450> doesn't<00:01:51.630> completely<00:01:52.439> absorb<00:01:52.890> or

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
because it doesn't completely absorb or

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.950 
because it doesn't completely absorb or
you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.790> kind<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> Pat<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> excess<00:01:54.750> off

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you can just kind of Pat the excess off

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can just kind of Pat the excess off
but<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.130> wanna<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.369> oily<00:01:56.700> during

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
because my eczema is almost completely

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.970 
because my eczema is almost completely
gone<00:02:51.879> now<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.120> continue<00:02:52.629> to<00:02:52.750> use<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:53.139> because

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
gone now I continue to use this because

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.319 
gone now I continue to use this because
I'm<00:02:54.340> guessing<00:02:54.549> it'll<00:02:54.819> probably<00:02:55.060> come<00:02:55.269> back

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
I'm guessing it'll probably come back

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.559 
I'm guessing it'll probably come back
but<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:57.099> makes<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:57.879> much<00:02:58.060> better<00:02:58.329> I'm

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
but this it makes it so much better I'm

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.330 
but this it makes it so much better I'm
really<00:02:58.840> excited<00:02:59.109> about<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.889> just<00:03:00.010> wanted
