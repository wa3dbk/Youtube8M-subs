00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.650
 Hello. I'll tell you. The product you see today is 7 8039 from the level . 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.980
 My Movie 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 It's a product, of course, in Lego . 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.590
 The Lego 7100 Triangle has a Lego movie. 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.449
 16 types of 16 kinds of catalysts with a miniature figure 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.640
 I'm probably low 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.650
 Oh, come on August retract time out of paper, and then the series that has a 3 or 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.090
 There were many other things like this. 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.290
 I think it's a pretty good product . 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.720
 It comes out with three bullets. 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.140
 Who Is Who 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.860
 I do not know the name yet . 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.050
 I will 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:56.140
 Yes, I will try to sneak out of the secondary double today. The most unique character 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.800
 Ah, boy, I think the hat on Lincoln is cool, but I'm wondering what the maximum touch is. 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.280
 Itneyo 5 demo lexus Sex 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.720
 I got better with Brown. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.820
 If I am the key, I will come to the box like this, 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.220
 It seemed to sell it. 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:19.479
 Oh, yes, it seems to me that this feeling of quality is bad for a paper box. 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:24.940
 While I was a little bitchy , 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:28.720
 If Abram is like a gum, this is the President of the United States. 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:33.100
 He said that he left for Yamato Master Builder for Lego Movie. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.780
 Honest Abe because of the nature of the person who borrows the rest of the block, 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:42.340
 A nickname that has a brown Lincoln built a house of their forests 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.060
 I live in a log cabin, and I built that log cabin alone and broke it. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 A figure 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.729
 Master builder is doing exercises or it looks like it looks delicious 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.050
 What a resonance 00 is determined and wise because a fellow master ball d who knows what 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.890
 To make 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 I always ask Abraham Lincoln for help when fighting goes away. 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:07.330
 Mom's problem is that he seems to be a great leader, 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.830
 I told you that the stunt business was made directly by Octa Co., Ltd. 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.850
 I do not know what you 're talking about . 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.040
 For what rock is packed real battle is over so this is cuddle Seasons 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.790
 I do not know what critical view would you greatly 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.380
 But this is probably not what I usually see when I see it. 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.570
 Unfortunately, for example, yet I would have liked Goods stoked the ratgo pretty well gave the show last 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.320
 I'm just so configured so 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:37.090
 It's really good. It looks like this. 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.980
 The problem is that when you put out a movie about the work, 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.570
 It was terrible. 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.110
 Plus, there is also the character from de deutbojap some character with no real names 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:52.000
 Geureongeo eunikka puts out to the end, especially in the 2nd bullet 3 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.470
 Our neighborhood that still let nundong look back a movie that is not who first came te 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.920
 I'm selling 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.780
 But how about that 9 minute boss? 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:07.330
 2 Try just need to have the whole movie would you enter angle and trajectory 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.030
 So let's go, so maybe I will escape and I will not go out with the third part. 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.030
 I do not think purchasing will be difficult. 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.900
 Rere's wrong with the lyrical operational examples 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.190
 The first thing to do is probably just this one in my series of five people I wrote 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:26.050
 I think the grandmother is so good in composition and good in quality. 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:30.280
 Two, three, unconditionally socialism, one shot is too poor quality. 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.800
 I do not think the characters are bad, so I do not think the people are leaving . 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.420
 What is this place? 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.270
 Holding more it's not in front for the People By The Pit That is 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.220
 But with Kennedy, what's this? 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:48.670
 Independence That 's the liberation of the slave. 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.860
 Oh, I do not know . 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.860
 The beard has a hat attached to it. 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.659
 It's unique. It 's also the first character. 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.220
 Of course, you'll see a little surprised that there is erotic pbo please give me five primary 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.099
 on 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.340
 That's when the product is in my mind. 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.700
 Well I think this will be applied to cap a very Variety 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.570
 Oh , you do not have a good product . 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.829
 If you like to buy a horse's profile Gareth Southern Water though.- Some servers do not buy 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.240
 Looks like you're gonna have a hard time. 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:27.280
 If you come in Korea and come in a little bit, it sounds like a pretty good ride. 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.830
 I can hardly see it since LEGO is almost anything. 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.510
 On the internet, but you have to make it a little expensive . 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:38.970
 These considerations classic ah, see saw without knowing hears hot and happy future 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.990
 The suspect explained that people who admire you as you go live 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.990
 So I'll end the show
