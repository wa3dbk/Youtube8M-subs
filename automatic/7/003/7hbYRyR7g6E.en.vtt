00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.789 
cortex a7 ma I think it's Mali GPU I'm
not<00:01:10.380> sure<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:11.310> also<00:01:11.549> sport<00:01:11.970> 3G<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.799> AGP

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

internal memory so let's cut this

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:27.679 
internal memory so let's cut this
plastic<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.109
