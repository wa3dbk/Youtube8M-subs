00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
a little bit with our strum pattern if

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.120 
a little bit with our strum pattern if
we<00:00:36.620> took<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.859> D<00:00:37.039> and<00:00:37.190> just<00:00:37.250> tried<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.760> lot

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.130 

down

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.599 

now

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
now

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.220 
now
so<00:00:48.969> we<00:00:49.030> tried<00:00:49.239> our<00:00:49.359> intro<00:00:49.719> with<00:00:49.870> our<00:00:49.960> strum

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
so we tried our intro with our strum

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.459 
so we tried our intro with our strum
pattern<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:50.859> have<00:00:50.890> da

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
pattern we have da

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.810 
pattern we have da
me<00:00:53.469> down

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.830 

be<00:00:58.239> damned

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.690 

from<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.560> intro<00:01:01.860> we<00:01:01.980> go<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.250> our<00:01:02.370> verse

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
from that intro we go into our verse

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.070 
from that intro we go into our verse
which<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.360> exactly<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.900> same

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
which is actually exactly the same

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.120 
which is actually exactly the same
progression<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.160> we<00:01:05.250> have

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.610 

down

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.350 

down<00:01:21.620> d-down

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.360 

and<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.500> into<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:26.010> chorus

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.429 

but<00:06:24.819> if<00:06:24.909> we<00:06:24.969> tried<00:06:25.240> to<00:06:25.270> start<00:06:25.569> our<00:06:25.990> strong

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
but if we tried to start our strong

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:36.080 
but if we tried to start our strong
pattern<00:06:26.770> through<00:06:26.949> we<00:06:27.490> have<00:06:27.639> to<00:06:27.759> you<00:06:27.849> the<00:06:28.000> town
