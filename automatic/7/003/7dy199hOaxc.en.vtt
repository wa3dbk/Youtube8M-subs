00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
because i think it looks pretty good but

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.459 
because i think it looks pretty good but
you<00:00:52.339> changes<00:00:52.609> to<00:00:52.699> common<00:00:52.999> blur<00:00:53.149> CC<00:00:53.870> style<00:00:54.199> or

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
you changes to common blur CC style or

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.169 
you changes to common blur CC style or
light<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.069> if<00:00:55.159> we<00:00:55.280> just<00:00:55.399> do<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.579> CC<00:00:55.909> style

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
light so if we just do the CC style

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.790 
light so if we just do the CC style
which<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.479> actually<00:00:56.659> default<00:00:57.229> i'll<00:00:57.559> show<00:00:57.739> you

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
which is actually default i'll show you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.529 
which is actually default i'll show you
that<00:00:57.920> here<00:00:58.069> in<00:00:58.159> just<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.370> second<00:00:58.789> but<00:00:58.909> here<00:00:59.420> you

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.860 
way down here to 1 2 3 4 5 or up to six
so<00:01:13.820> we'll<00:01:13.940> just<00:01:14.000> swipe<00:01:14.300> this<00:01:14.510> all<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> way

so we'll just swipe this all the way

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.790 
so we'll just swipe this all the way
over<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.440> six<00:01:16.430> if<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.790> can<00:01:16.970> grab<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.680> the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
over to six if I can grab that so the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.350 
over to six if I can grab that so the
slider<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.250> acting<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.580> little<00:01:19.760> finicky<00:01:20.090> but

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360
