00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.759 

one<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> criteria<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.649> we're<00:00:07.950> using<00:00:08.540> in

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
one of the criteria that we're using in

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.860 
one of the criteria that we're using in
evaluating<00:00:10.769> where<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.580> enter<00:00:12.059> into

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
evaluating where and how we enter into

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.450 
evaluating where and how we enter into
different<00:00:13.259> markets<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.830> really<00:00:14.280> through<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
different markets is really through the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.700 
different markets is really through the
lens<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.059> sustainable<00:00:15.540> business<00:00:15.870> model<00:00:15.900> so

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
lens of a sustainable business model so

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
lens of a sustainable business model so
there's<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> variety<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.029> components<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.720> we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
there's a variety of components that we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.010 
there's a variety of components that we
need<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.340> place<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.449> reach<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.840> tipping

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
need to have in place to reach a tipping

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.920 
need to have in place to reach a tipping
point<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.650> again<00:00:22.980> i<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.930> technology

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
point and again i think is as technology

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.080 
point and again i think is as technology
advances<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.949> better<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.609> using

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
advances as we get better about using

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
advances as we get better about using
our<00:00:27.210> scale<00:00:27.510> better<00:00:27.810> learnings<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.529> move

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
our scale better learnings as we move

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.140 
our scale better learnings as we move
from<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.160> developing<00:00:29.640> market<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> another

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
from one developing market to another

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.659 
from one developing market to another
it's<00:00:31.080> enabled<00:00:31.529> us<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> move<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.189> time<00:00:32.460> line<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's enabled us to move that time line a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's enabled us to move that time line a
little<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.090> forward<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:33.780> able<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
little bit forward so we're able to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
little bit forward so we're able to
enter<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> markets<00:00:35.100> earlier<00:00:35.969> than<00:00:36.180> we

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
enter into the markets earlier than we

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.940 
enter into the markets earlier than we
would<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> past<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> premise

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
would have in the past but the premise

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.979 
would have in the past but the premise
is<00:00:38.129> still<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> same<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
is still the same we have to have a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
is still the same we have to have a
route<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> market<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.309> capable<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
route to market that's that's capable of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
route to market that's that's capable of
sustaining<00:00:42.329> our<00:00:42.510> business<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.469> reliable

infrastructure that we're talking about
so<00:05:27.300> it's<00:05:27.510> trickier<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.110> more<00:05:28.320> holistic<00:05:28.590> now

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
so it's trickier it's more holistic now

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.260 
so it's trickier it's more holistic now
than<00:05:29.160> it<00:05:29.250> used<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.490> be
