00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
 farmer practice video 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.050
 christoph at the family leitner bin 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.630
 the people christoph i come from the 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.430
 poor country and we are here today 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.320
 our cheese factory we in the third 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.140
 operate generation 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.780
 I want to introduce you to today 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.160
 make good cheese 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.550
 we need a good base and that is 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.619
 with us the feeding of qualitative 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.280
 high quality hay and that three 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.350
 reasons 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.300
 in our case, and first of all , great 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.030
 a taste advantage the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.580
 Domestic is just not happy 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.949
 charged like a silage that is the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.970
 First advantage of the customer immediately taste 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.909
 can and can smell 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.850
 the second advantage is that the secret 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.059
 there are no sporadic clostridia in it 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.739
 later in the cheese factory of flatulence 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.260
 causes and the third point of 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.790
 secretly if cheese for me 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.519
 want to produce delicacies so 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.650
 very high quality cheese goes 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.250
 that only because of the full milk track because 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.580
 she just let me do that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.009
 Industrial quality covers the cleanliness 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.140
 and hygiene is the most important thing for us 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.570
 point and that starts in the cowshed 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 at the hut at the feed table 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.460
 later in the milking parlor at the melk work 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.320
 that gloves are used 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.479
 the cleaned will be disinfected 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.969
 if you can make mistakes there i can 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.780
 nothing in the later cheese production 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.880
 make up more 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.070
 you stick to the hygiene rules 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.750
 does not happen in a 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.189
 fresh produce that they mold 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.789
 that they are not suitable for consumption 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.310
 are 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.540
 when HartkÃ¤se specifically you only realize 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.920
 after half a year he 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.119
 just do not inflate that you do 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 can sell more and thus 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.130
 causes economic damage 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.020
 first step in the cheese dairy is that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.770
 we take our milk to 72 degrees 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.930
 then pasteurise in the pan film 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.960
 then comes a as the Next Step 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.530
 acid alarm clock that can be added in normal 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.780
 case be a sour cream 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.450
 There are also many different ones 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.540
 control cultures that one in various 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.739
 can buy shops 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.290
 this culture then leaves you an hour 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.900
 the construction worker acts on it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.850
 lowers milk and if the culture is right 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.310
 has matured then comes the next one 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.220
 step that we add the foliage 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.880
 that's about three grams per 100 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.160
 liter 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.530
 one is stirred and then the milk must 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.780
 stay around 30 to 40 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.430
 minutes then she is stuck there you can 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.050
 Do a rehearsal because then you run 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.100
 for putting in and pulling out again 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.870
 the runner has to be clean and then something 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.060
 Next , you take the harp 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.890
 one cuts a longitudinal section man 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.650
 seems a cross section and receives 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.250
 thus small cubes that is the cheese 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.989
 break it says so far to the cheese 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.820
 our bigger ones should be these pieces 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.769
 and veste of cheese is used as a 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.549
 Hard cheese should be finer this 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.579
 his breakfast that is hard cheese corn grain 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.310
 big rice sick soft cheese walnut 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.079
 size after cutting with the harp 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.790
 you start to stir quite easily 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.940
 careful and actually stops until 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.280
 do not fill up with the cheese 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.290
 if the consistency stir after that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.140
 the fresh the fit church piece 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.480
 have a certain strength there is 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.130
 again a sample gives a piece of cheese 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.690
 and leaves it around 30 40 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.579
 centimeters in height on the hand 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.630
 fall and if the cheese is not piece 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.220
 bursts then fits that 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.829
 it should have easily felt king 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.350
 then you feel the cheese break into shapes 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.959
 the holes are so that the whey yes 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.209
 leaked is wrinkle when cutting 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.780
 can and then you can depending on the taste 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.430
 Make a raw version of the fresh cheese 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.830
 You can chop one up 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.860
 may have to fold 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.200
 pepper paprika the city â€‹â€‹savors 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.030
 different you can play there and 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.620
 let off steam 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.170
 if you have finished filling the will 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.420
 cheese every half hour about twice 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.850
 turned then then also remains three to 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.950
 four hours in the warm room with it 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.859
 after that matures and then actually is 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.070
 ready for salt bath that's a motto 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.710
 water mixed with salt of the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.580
 depending on the salt content , the cheese will stay behind 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.900
 desired salt content 1 23 hours 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.390
 lying inside or floating inside 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.950
 then let it drain and then you can 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.270
 the fresh cheese the next day already 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.270
 be served
