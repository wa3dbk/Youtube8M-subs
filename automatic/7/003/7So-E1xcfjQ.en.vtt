00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
the wax and then we can make them longer

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.410 
the wax and then we can make them longer
by<00:05:09.900> twisting<00:05:10.620> them<00:05:10.830> together<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.640> make<00:05:11.970> them

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
by twisting them together to make them

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.260 
by twisting them together to make them
longer<00:05:13.280> so

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.580 

it<00:05:19.270> looks<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:19.900> gorgeous<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:21.190> we<00:05:21.760> took<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.590> wax

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
it looks so gorgeous so we took a wax

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.340 
it looks so gorgeous so we took a wax
one<00:05:24.430> out<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:25.030> extras<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:25.750> then<00:05:25.990> we<00:05:26.140> just

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
one out of the extras and then we just

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.280 
one out of the extras and then we just
twist<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:26.830> around<00:05:27.010> so<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:28.360> would<00:05:28.630> make<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.080> look

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
twist it around so it would make it look

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.080 
twist it around so it would make it look
longer<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.640> the<00:05:30.850> yarn<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:31.780> can<00:05:31.990> put<00:05:32.260> this

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
longer so the yarn you can put this

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:41.400 
longer so the yarn you can put this
little<00:05:34.090> glitter<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:35.820> onto<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.900> yarn<00:05:39.720> 151<00:05:40.720> just
