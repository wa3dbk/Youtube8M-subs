00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I'll learn a little bit more about the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.210 
I'll learn a little bit more about the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.400 

though<00:00:26.179> so<00:00:26.420> these<00:00:26.509> are<00:00:26.689> indeed<00:00:26.869> very<00:00:26.929> tight

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
though so these are indeed very tight

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
though so these are indeed very tight
turns<00:00:27.680> that<00:00:27.949> van<00:00:28.189> takes

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.260 

now<00:00:33.180> we're<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.750> speed

you've obviously driven a lot of
different<00:00:49.410> sports<00:00:49.680> cars<00:00:50.160> where<00:00:51.090> would<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
different sports cars where would you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.470 
different sports cars where would you
say<00:00:51.570> does<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.990> SLS<00:00:52.380> AMG<00:00:52.500> range<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.700> topsail

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
say does the SLS AMG range of topsail

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.700 
say does the SLS AMG range of topsail
along<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.050> top<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> moment

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
along the top of the moment
