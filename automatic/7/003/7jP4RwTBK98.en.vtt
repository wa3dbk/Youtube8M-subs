longitudinals<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.130> are<00:01:19.220> actually<00:01:19.610> welded

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
longitudinals that are actually welded

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.850 
longitudinals that are actually welded
to<00:01:20.300> every<00:01:20.630> rib<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.140> correct<00:01:21.380> that's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
to every rib is that correct that's

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.890 
to every rib is that correct that's
correct<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:22.820> must<00:01:23.420> give<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.690> boat<00:01:23.869> a

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
correct and that must give the boat a

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.960 
correct and that must give the boat a
really<00:01:24.229> solid<00:01:24.470> structure<00:01:25.130> absolutely<00:01:25.850> it's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
really solid structure absolutely it's

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.490 
really solid structure absolutely it's
one<00:01:26.060> of<00:01:26.240> our<00:01:26.360> best<00:01:26.540> performing<00:01:27.020> hulls<00:01:27.170> very

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
one of our best performing hulls very

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.700 
one of our best performing hulls very
very<00:01:27.890> strong<00:01:28.210> on<00:01:29.210> an<00:01:29.330> alumna<00:01:29.780> boat<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.350> must<00:01:30.560> be

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
very strong on an alumna boat it must be

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.109 
very strong on an alumna boat it must be
tough<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.280> get<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.580> strength<00:01:31.970> and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
tough to really get that strength and

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.029 
tough to really get that strength and
rigidity<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.110> keel<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.590> boat<00:01:33.649> how<00:01:33.979> do

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
rigidity in the keel of the boat how do

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.070 
rigidity in the keel of the boat how do
you<00:01:34.160> do<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:35.210> actually<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.750> full

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
you do that here we actually have a full

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.469 
you do that here we actually have a full
length<00:01:36.259> center<00:01:36.710> keel<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.430> extruded<00:01:38.090> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
length center keel that is extruded that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.210 
length center keel that is extruded that
holds<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.990> two<00:01:39.170> hull<00:01:39.410> halves<00:01:39.649> together<00:01:39.830> and

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
holds the two hull halves together and

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.370 
holds the two hull halves together and
there's<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.880> weld<00:01:41.450> that's<00:01:41.780> placed<00:01:42.050> on<00:01:42.200> each

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
there's a weld that's placed on each

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.260 
there's a weld that's placed on each
side<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.950> all<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.280> way<00:01:43.369> from<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.789> transom

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
side of it all the way from the transom

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.090 
side of it all the way from the transom
to<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.720> bow<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.050> boat<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.500> helps<00:01:45.920> make

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
to the bow of the boat that helps make

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.830 
to the bow of the boat that helps make
sure<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.580> boat<00:01:46.729> holds<00:01:47.180> together<00:01:47.300> now

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
sure that the boat holds together now

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480 
sure that the boat holds together now
let's<00:01:48.050> take<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> look<00:01:48.530> at<00:01:48.710> some<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.920> these<00:01:49.070> welds

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
let's take a look at some of these welds

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.710 
let's take a look at some of these welds
because<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.759> course<00:01:49.940> in<00:01:50.060> an<00:01:50.149> aluminum<00:01:50.360> boat

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
because of course in an aluminum boat

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.389 
because of course in an aluminum boat
what<00:01:51.289> could<00:01:51.440> be<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:51.680> important<00:01:52.070> than<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.220> well

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
what could be more important than a well

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.100 
what could be more important than a well
sure<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:53.180> can<00:01:53.360> see<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.720> they're<00:01:53.899> feathered

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
sure we can see that they're feathered

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.889 
sure we can see that they're feathered
nicely<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.520> there<00:01:55.910> are<00:01:55.970> no<00:01:56.090> bubbles<00:01:56.360> it's

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
nicely and there are no bubbles it's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.090 
nicely and there are no bubbles it's
