00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
tells us what it includes in the box and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.839 
tells us what it includes in the box and
how<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.210> ways<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.920> polar<00:00:29.369> pattern<00:00:29.730> which

how much ways of the polar pattern which
is<00:00:30.000> omnidirectional<00:00:30.349> what<00:00:31.349> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.560> element

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
is omnidirectional what kind of element

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280 
is omnidirectional what kind of element
a<00:00:32.009> microphone<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.790> condenser<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.390> whatnot

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
a microphone it is condenser and whatnot

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
a microphone it is condenser and whatnot
so<00:00:35.010> we're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.399> go<00:00:35.430> ahead<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> open<00:00:35.969> up

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so we're going to go ahead and open up

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
so we're going to go ahead and open up
the<00:00:36.540> box<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.290> bought<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:37.829> ebay

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the box you know I bought this off ebay

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
the box you know I bought this off ebay
for<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.540> $32<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> pretty<00:00:40.020> cheap<00:00:40.290> for

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
for about $32 which is pretty cheap for

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
for about $32 which is pretty cheap for
a<00:00:40.530> microphone<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> look<00:00:42.210> we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
a microphone like this and it look we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
a microphone like this and it look we
lost<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> windscreen<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.879> i'll<00:00:47.879> be

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
lost the windscreen there but i'll be

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.459 
lost the windscreen there but i'll be
linking<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> description<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
linking that in the description for you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.250 
linking that in the description for you
guys<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> look<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.020> here<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.230> have

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
guys to have a look at so here we have

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.340 
guys to have a look at so here we have
the<00:00:52.710> microphone<00:00:53.190> itself<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:55.199> ahead

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the microphone itself and we go ahead

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
the microphone itself and we go ahead
and<00:00:55.500> take<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.219> i<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.579> without

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and take that out if i can without

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.810 
and take that out if i can without
breaking<00:00:57.239> anything<00:00:57.480> hopefully<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.820> it's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
breaking anything hopefully and it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
breaking anything hopefully and it's
pretty<00:01:00.180> small<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.230> shouldn't<00:01:01.649> show<00:01:01.800> up

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
pretty small so it shouldn't show up

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.350 
pretty small so it shouldn't show up
that<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.329> screen<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.939> here<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.119> i

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that much on screen and here is i

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
that much on screen and here is i
believe<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.930> power<00:01:07.229> source<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
believe the power source for the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.760 
believe the power source for the
microphone<00:01:09.090> itself<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.750> runs<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.500> watch

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
microphone itself and it runs on a watch

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
microphone itself and it runs on a watch
battery<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.990> now<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.229> had

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
battery down here now people had

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
battery down here now people had
problems<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
problems with this when they get the the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
problems with this when they get the the
microphone<00:01:16.500> itself<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> box<00:01:17.220> saying<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
microphone itself in the box saying that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.179 
microphone itself in the box saying that
the<00:01:17.880> battery<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.390> dead<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> microphone

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the battery is dead so if the microphone

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.440 
the battery is dead so if the microphone
doesn't<00:01:20.369> work<00:01:20.490> off<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> bat<00:01:21.030> give<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
doesn't work off the bat give it a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
doesn't work off the bat give it a
chance<00:01:21.659> buy<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> new<00:01:22.259> watch<00:01:22.439> battery<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
chance buy a new watch battery and it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
chance buy a new watch battery and it
should<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.759> able<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.090> work<00:01:24.240> fun<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> have

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
should be able to work fun now you have

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
should be able to work fun now you have
an<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:25.920> switch<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> also<00:01:26.759> clips

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
an on and off switch and it also clips

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
an on and off switch and it also clips
to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.530> belt<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> looks<00:01:29.250> at

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to the back of your belt by the looks at

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.830 
to the back of your belt by the looks at
which<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:29.850> cool<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.600> could<00:01:30.750> be

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
which is pretty cool that could be

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.990 
which is pretty cool that could be
useful<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.490> keeping<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.820> off<00:01:33.390> screen<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
useful for keeping it off screen and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.719 
useful for keeping it off screen and
whatnot<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.140> here<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.680> 3.5<00:01:38.400> millimeter

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
whatnot so here is the 3.5 millimeter

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600 
whatnot so here is the 3.5 millimeter
jack<00:01:39.270> input<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> microphone<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.340> sell

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
jack input for the microphone it sell

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.260 
jack input for the microphone it sell
now<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.540> microphone<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.680> mono<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.820> records

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
now this microphone is mono it records

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
now this microphone is mono it records
in<00:01:45.479> mato<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.930> stereo<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> may<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in mato not stereo so you may need to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.179 
in mato not stereo so you may need to
