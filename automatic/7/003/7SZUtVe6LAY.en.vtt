00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
you know about the texture pack release

you know about the texture pack release
date<00:03:29.400> stuff<00:03:29.699> you<00:03:29.909> know<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.090> that's<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.389> to

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
date stuff you know if that's going to

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.119 
date stuff you know if that's going to
be<00:03:30.629> zero<00:03:30.959> point<00:03:31.139> eleven<00:03:31.349> point<00:03:31.500> oh<00:03:31.590> which<00:03:31.829> I

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
be zero point eleven point oh which I

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.280 
be zero point eleven point oh which I
really<00:03:32.639> don't<00:03:32.819> think<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.090> will<00:03:33.239> but<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.139> it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
really don't think it will but if it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
really don't think it will but if it
does<00:03:34.590> end<00:03:34.919> up<00:03:35.010> being<00:03:35.220> zero<00:03:35.400> point<00:03:35.579> oven<00:03:35.760> point

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
does end up being zero point oven point

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.849 
does end up being zero point oven point
0<00:03:36.060> then<00:03:36.269> that's<00:03:36.569> probably<00:03:37.019> when<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> would<00:03:37.709> just

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
0 then that's probably when I would just

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.189 
0 then that's probably when I would just
stop<00:03:38.370> working<00:03:38.639> on<00:03:38.940> texture<00:03:39.389> pack<00:03:39.599> in<00:03:39.840> skin
