00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
into the grocery aisle to see what my

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850 
into the grocery aisle to see what my
store<00:00:50.789> had<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.629> these<00:00:51.840> items<00:00:52.079> came<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.559> two

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
store had and these items came from two

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.510 
store had and these items came from two
different<00:00:53.190> rite<00:00:53.520> aids<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> pricing

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
different rite aids because the pricing

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.180 
different rite aids because the pricing
may<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.879> different<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:58.020> store<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:59.070> at

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
may be different in your store like at

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
may be different in your store like at
one<00:00:59.430> store<00:00:59.699> an<00:01:00.390> item<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> i<00:01:00.989> thought<00:01:01.260> was

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
one store an item that i thought was

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
one store an item that i thought was
seventy-five<00:01:01.859> percent<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.460> only<00:01:02.699> tagged

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
seventy-five percent off was only tagged

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.570 
seventy-five percent off was only tagged
for<00:01:03.180> twenty-five<00:01:03.629> percent<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.549> i

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
for twenty-five percent off so what i

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.230 
for twenty-five percent off so what i
would<00:01:05.729> suggest<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.909> scan

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
would suggest is that you have them scan

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
would suggest is that you have them scan
it<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.960> possible<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> may<00:01:10.979> be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it because it's possible that it may be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
it because it's possible that it may be
tagged<00:01:11.490> twenty-five<00:01:12.090> percent<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> may

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
tagged twenty-five percent but it may

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
tagged twenty-five percent but it may
ring<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.860> seventy-five<00:01:14.430> percent<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.030> that's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
ring up seventy-five percent so that's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
ring up seventy-five percent so that's
my<00:01:15.390> suggestion<00:01:15.869> i<00:01:16.170> didn't<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.220> just

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

went by with tags i saw in a store but
after<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> thought<00:01:20.729> about<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.180> should<00:01:21.390> have
