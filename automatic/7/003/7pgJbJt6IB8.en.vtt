00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.169
 what is going to happen for four weeks now, and me and we are still 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.639

 Stefan Lauer evening really not for the starting balance is arrested 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.299
 the criminal law is terrible 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.439
 with 5 0 but the whole team is split in two 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.879
 and indeed I have no choice 3 millimeters 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.149
 KlingelhÃ¶fer or not 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.149
 and here Zermatt 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.599
 the microphone with Prof 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.349
 Tomatoes around 300 millimeters thick that means I can do any 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.829
 Use headphones 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.480
 I think that I am very super I do not have to go to the forecasts anymore 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.859
 that also necessarily more 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.949
 around the components with each other and I can place it anywhere 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.949
 the last time too late 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.889

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.819
 times the medium arrives to the Xperia x10 mini then we see what the x10 mini 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.260
 for headphones has indeed get the horny as this deal 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.029
 to not have time to govern 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:12.839
 for the comfort of Wednesday 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.440
 without headphones part 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.619
 but then 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.870
 but with the much better in the trunk 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.669
 Who is that that has never been so the board Schaeffler which counters 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.490
 down 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.330
 I also have to understand therefore Faber 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.590
 it is the fourth player to VfB in the 14th 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 that Blizzard is just often not finished somehow missing 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080

 first time to BIEK scenes 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.319
 that we look like 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.779
 from the processing 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.699
 Piquet for this percent 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.639

 Percent Berghorn homescreen around 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.029
 and that has no position 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:16.309
 Herne and there was the device to this point absolutely no two thumbs up then 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:18.249
 I think it's wonderful 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.869
 then back to the meal we do not share a little bit more of the good 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:23.379
 Piece will present 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.460

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.599
