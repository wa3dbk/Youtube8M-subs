bone highlight I'm comparing it to the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.330 
bone highlight I'm comparing it to the
Mac<00:00:57.230> 239<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:58.880> Mac<00:00:59.330> 239<00:00:59.600> is<00:01:00.110> natural<00:01:00.680> fibers<00:01:01.130> I

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
Mac 239 the Mac 239 is natural fibers I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.200 
Mac 239 the Mac 239 is natural fibers I
believe<00:01:01.730> it's<00:01:02.090> made<00:01:02.720> out<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.170> goat<00:01:03.410> hair<00:01:03.440> and

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
believe it's made out of goat hair and

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210 
believe it's made out of goat hair and
Lexi<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.449> course<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:06.170> synthetic<00:01:06.380> since<00:01:07.040> they

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
Lexi of course it's synthetic since they

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.120 
Lexi of course it's synthetic since they
are<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.460> cruelty-free<00:01:08.119> company<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.130> the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
are a cruelty-free company and the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.840 
are a cruelty-free company and the
difference<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.760> that<00:01:11.120> Mac<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.900> $25<00:01:12.770> Lexi<00:01:13.370> is<00:01:13.580> 12

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
difference is that Mac is $25 Lexi is 12

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.210 
difference is that Mac is $25 Lexi is 12
so<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.420> 205<00:01:18.020> taper<00:01:18.530> blending<00:01:18.980> brush

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
so this is the 205 taper blending brush

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.640 
so this is the 205 taper blending brush
and<00:01:19.460> I'm<00:01:20.180> comparing<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.440> Mac

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
and I'm comparing this one to the Mac

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.770 
and I'm comparing this one to the Mac

as when I dip it into the gel liner and
I<00:04:16.579> squeezed<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.269> tip<00:04:17.539> of<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.750> brush<00:04:17.930> it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
I squeezed the tip of the brush it

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.800 
I squeezed the tip of the brush it
actually<00:04:18.680> makes<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.130> really<00:04:19.459> thin<00:04:19.760> line<00:04:20.450> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
actually makes it a really thin line and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.980 
actually makes it a really thin line and
the<00:04:21.620> Mac<00:04:21.859> retails<00:04:22.280> for<00:04:22.370> $20<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.660> Lexy

the Mac retails for $20 and the Lexy
retails<00:04:24.349> for<00:04:24.440> 10

my<00:04:46.140> brows<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:47.610> two<00:04:47.910> way<00:04:48.120> it's<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:48.660> tiny<00:04:48.990> bit

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
my brows the two way it's a tiny bit

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.040 
my brows the two way it's a tiny bit
smaller<00:04:49.680> than<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.130> Luxy<00:04:50.520> one<00:04:50.730> and<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.810> Mac

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
smaller than the Luxy one and the Mac

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110 
smaller than the Luxy one and the Mac
retails<00:04:52.620> for<00:04:52.680> twenty<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.310> Lexy<00:04:53.700> retails<00:04:54.060> for

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
retails for twenty the Lexy retails for

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.380 
retails for twenty the Lexy retails for
ten

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
ten

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.450 
ten
next<00:04:57.390> is<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.870> 209<00:04:58.440> large<00:04:58.770> shader<00:04:59.130> brush<00:04:59.250> and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
next is the 209 large shader brush and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.430 
next is the 209 large shader brush and
I'm<00:04:59.940> comparing<00:05:00.480> it<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.050> Mac<00:05:01.320> 252<00:05:02.310> I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
I'm comparing it to the Mac 252 I

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.860 
I'm comparing it to the Mac 252 I
believe<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.620> 252<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.580> natural<00:05:06.270> fibers<00:05:06.450> I

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
believe the 252 is natural fibers I

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.960 
believe the 252 is natural fibers I
wouldn't<00:05:07.320> know<00:05:07.470> what<00:05:07.740> animal<00:05:08.280> they<00:05:08.550> get<00:05:08.760> this

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
wouldn't know what animal they get this

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.510 
wouldn't know what animal they get this
fiber<00:05:09.240> from<00:05:09.770> but<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:12.270> Mac<00:05:12.630> one<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.110> wider<00:05:13.520> it's

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
fiber from but the Mac one is wider it's

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.610 
fiber from but the Mac one is wider it's
a<00:05:14.670> different<00:05:15.000> shape<00:05:15.240> but<00:05:15.870> they're<00:05:16.020> both<00:05:16.230> large

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
a different shape but they're both large

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.710 
a different shape but they're both large
shader<00:05:17.070> brushes<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.760> would<00:05:18.060> use<00:05:18.300> this<00:05:18.480> type<00:05:18.690> of

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
shader brushes I would use this type of

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.880 
shader brushes I would use this type of
brush<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.620> pack<00:05:19.860> on<00:05:20.010> color<00:05:20.310> on<00:05:20.580> my<00:05:20.790> lid<00:05:21.000> and

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
brush to pack on color on my lid and

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.860 
brush to pack on color on my lid and
basically<00:05:22.890> that's<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:24.150> Mac<00:05:24.390> retails<00:05:24.780> for

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
basically that's it the Mac retails for

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.680 
basically that's it the Mac retails for
$32<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:25.920> Alexi<00:05:26.580> 4:12<00:05:28.280> this<00:05:29.280> is<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.580> 229<00:05:30.240> taper

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
$32 and Alexi 4:12 this is the 229 taper

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.290 
$32 and Alexi 4:12 this is the 229 taper
blending<00:05:31.080> brush<00:05:31.260> it's<00:05:31.830> not<00:05:32.100> an<00:05:32.280> exact<00:05:32.760> dupe<00:05:33.090> to

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
blending brush it's not an exact dupe to

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.170 
blending brush it's not an exact dupe to
the<00:05:33.450> Mac<00:05:33.630> 217<00:05:34.070> but<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.100> like<00:05:35.370> using<00:05:35.610> this<00:05:35.880> brush

the Mac 217 but I like using this brush

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.600 
the Mac 217 but I like using this brush
to<00:05:36.240> apply<00:05:36.720> color<00:05:37.230> and<00:05:37.530> blend<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.950> as<00:05:38.370> I'm

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
to apply color and blend it as I'm

for<00:05:41.790> are<00:05:42.030> also<00:05:42.360> blending<00:05:42.990> any<00:05:43.140> harsh<00:05:43.470> edges

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
the Mac 217 has a flat side to it which

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.710 
the Mac 217 has a flat side to it which
the<00:05:51.590> 229<00:05:52.640> Lexi<00:05:53.640> doesn't<00:05:53.880> it's<00:05:54.180> more<00:05:54.510> of<00:05:54.630> a

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
the 229 Lexi doesn't it's more of a

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.720 
the 229 Lexi doesn't it's more of a
rounded<00:05:55.200> shape<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:57.570> Mac<00:05:57.780> 217<00:05:58.080> retails<00:05:58.860> for<00:05:58.950> 24

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
rounded shape the Mac 217 retails for 24

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.410 
rounded shape the Mac 217 retails for 24
and<00:05:59.760> the<00:06:00.270> Lexi<00:06:00.660> retails<00:06:01.080> for<00:06:01.170> 12

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
and the Lexi retails for 12

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.840 
and the Lexi retails for 12
okay<00:06:03.420> so<00:06:03.480> the<00:06:03.690> last<00:06:03.900> brush<00:06:04.230> is<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.770> 211<00:06:05.610> and

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
okay so the last brush is the 211 and

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.300 
okay so the last brush is the 211 and
it's<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.360> concealer<00:06:06.870> brush<00:06:07.140> I'm<00:06:07.410> going<00:06:08.190> to

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
it's the concealer brush I'm going to

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.220

compare<00:06:08.640> it<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:08.910> Mac<00:06:09.150> 249

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
compare it to the Mac 249

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.560 
compare it to the Mac 249
they're<00:06:10.530> both<00:06:10.800> synthetic<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:12.360> only

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
they're both synthetic the only

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.840 
they're both synthetic the only
difference<00:06:12.960> is<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:13.200> the<00:06:13.350> Mac<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.830> wider<00:06:14.400> I

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
difference is that the Mac is wider I

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.390 
difference is that the Mac is wider I
