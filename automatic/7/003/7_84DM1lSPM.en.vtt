00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:17.890 

well

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.410 

so<00:00:18.439> I<00:00:18.500> think<00:00:18.770> what<00:00:19.310> we<00:00:19.460> have<00:00:19.490> happened<00:00:19.970> here<00:00:20.210> is

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
so I think what we have happened here is

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.529 
so I think what we have happened here is
the<00:00:21.160> steps<00:00:22.160> per<00:00:22.430> millimeter<00:00:22.820> for<00:00:23.090> feeding<00:00:23.449> the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
the steps per millimeter for feeding the

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.980 
the steps per millimeter for feeding the
filament<00:00:23.930> was<00:00:24.140> off<00:00:24.380> by<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.740> factor<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.250> 2<00:00:25.990> which

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
filament was off by a factor of 2 which

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.210 
filament was off by a factor of 2 which
is<00:00:27.140> causing<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.560> Phoenix<00:00:27.890> Gruden

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
is causing the Phoenix Gruden

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.860 
is causing the Phoenix Gruden
didn't<00:00:31.150> extrusion<00:00:31.739> because<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.860> was<00:00:33.870> looking

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
didn't extrusion because it was looking

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.540 
didn't extrusion because it was looking
like<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:36.610> you<00:00:37.030> know<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:38.770> I<00:00:38.800> was<00:00:38.949> thin<00:00:39.220> it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
like it's you know well I was thin it

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.630 
like it's you know well I was thin it
was<00:00:39.699> obviously<00:00:40.090> thins<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.620> as<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.309> raised

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
was obviously thins and as I raised

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.979 
was obviously thins and as I raised
numbers<00:00:43.059> he<00:00:43.180> got<00:00:43.329> better<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.660> better<00:00:43.720> but

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
numbers he got better and better but

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.259 
numbers he got better and better but
never<00:00:44.199> got<00:00:44.379> really<00:00:45.010> good<00:00:45.280> until<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:45.970> got<00:00:46.239> to

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
never got really good until I got to

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.170 
never got really good until I got to
about<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.629> hundred<00:00:46.839> forty<00:00:47.410> but<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.699> originally

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
about a hundred forty but it originally

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.720 
about a hundred forty but it originally
started<00:00:49.210> out<00:00:49.570> at<00:00:49.750> 88<00:00:50.309> which<00:00:51.309> means<00:00:51.579> that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
started out at 88 which means that

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.600 
started out at 88 which means that
double<00:00:52.269> dies<00:00:52.420> 1760<00:00:53.350> i'm<00:00:53.440> thinking<00:00:53.769> maybe<00:00:53.890> they

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
double dies 1760 i'm thinking maybe they

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.689 
double dies 1760 i'm thinking maybe they
should<00:00:54.790> have<00:00:54.879> been<00:00:54.909> 176<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:57.309> stepper

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
should have been 176 because the stepper

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.170 
should have been 176 because the stepper
you<00:00:57.909> can<00:00:58.120> change<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.280> actual<00:01:00.489> number<00:01:01.059> of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
you can change the the actual number of

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.920 
you can change the the actual number of
steps<00:01:01.449> per<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.140> stuff<00:01:02.439> pulse<00:01:03.720> basically<00:01:04.720> does

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
steps per the stuff pulse basically does

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.280 
steps per the stuff pulse basically does
either<00:01:05.170> full<00:01:05.470> steps<00:01:05.770> half<00:01:05.979> steps<00:01:06.310> whatever

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
either full steps half steps whatever

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.570 
either full steps half steps whatever
and<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.530> maybe<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.830> was<00:01:08.950> just<00:01:08.979> asked<00:01:09.460> by<00:01:09.549> a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
and so maybe it was just asked by a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.930 
and so maybe it was just asked by a
factor<00:01:09.820> too<00:01:10.270> because<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:11.049> was<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.229> match

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.180 

just<00:01:18.600> looking<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.440> extruded<00:01:19.980> but

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
just looking a little over extruded but

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.790 
just looking a little over extruded but
it's<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.610> layer<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.800> also

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
it's the first layer so that's also

00:01:22.800 --> 00:02:01.430 
it's the first layer so that's also
possible<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.760> too<00:01:23.910> much<00:01:32.330> before

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.750 

you<00:02:02.440> think<00:02:02.740> right<00:02:02.950> after<00:02:03.070> Christmas<00:02:03.610> they

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
you think right after Christmas they

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:25.150 
you think right after Christmas they
play<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.150> Christmas<00:02:04.780> presents

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.100 

yeah<00:02:26.300> since<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.390> said<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.660> wanted<00:02:27.870> something

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
yeah since you said you wanted something

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.850 
yeah since you said you wanted something
I<00:02:28.319> needed<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.330> return<00:02:30.330> my<00:02:30.780> bearings<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
I needed it to return my bearings I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.890 
I needed it to return my bearings I
wanted<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> different<00:02:33.269> approach<00:02:33.540> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
wanted to take a different approach to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.470 
wanted to take a different approach to
how<00:02:34.200> i<00:02:34.230> did<00:02:34.530> some

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.480
