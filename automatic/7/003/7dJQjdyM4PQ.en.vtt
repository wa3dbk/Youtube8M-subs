00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.910
 youtube this video specially 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.910
 rented for owners of brand and slavuty 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 I am the owner of this unique 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.320
 car and want to tell you about 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.000
 sore 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.200
 well over i look aurelius words something me 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.620
 name is wow so machine is cheap and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.380
 angrily there are some problems that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 very difficult to solve especially in Russia 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:53.870
 this wheels is a very interesting system on 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.050
 three bolts as if interestingly invented 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 but there is a problem in balancing how their 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 only make there such a hole on the machines 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.229
 for balancing 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.229
 there are no such adapters and how to be 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.270
 some of course rework chassis 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.659
 but Zhigulevsk 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.659
 but some make adapters 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:29.549
 thick round metal is cut 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:33.119
 go to the turner will pull it out like under the wheel 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.549
 size and with this adapter go 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.549
 balance on what adapter tom 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:45.290
 the wheels on them, well, I've found a solution 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:48.680
 easier and more interesting to this 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:56.200
 Internet here rummaged nobody 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.200
 solved the problem here is of course possible so 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.800
 remove the drum 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.229
 front wheels and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.150
 with them go like an adapter and 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.830
 wheel balancing 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.870
 Well, I did not pass my car to disassemble 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.230
 because if you make out how then 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.630
 go or take apart our new 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.520
 tire changer is also somehow not an option 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.480
 so I got it on demolition 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.480
 middle drum 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:40.409
 there was a brake disc in the back 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:44.859
 its snow bolts here 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:49.599
 pounded by sledgehammers they are here so much 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:54.430
 stuck out of course the little ones stole here 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:57.099
 because they are very tight does not go 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.250
 in this way I solved problems with 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.099
 wheel balancing 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.459
 so who liked this video was 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.269
 helpful like everyone thanks for 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.269
 view bye 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.920
