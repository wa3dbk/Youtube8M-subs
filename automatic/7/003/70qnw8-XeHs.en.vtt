00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.479
 hello to all your good friends 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.460
 I'm going to make a good video that is not 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.440
 a tutorial or a minecraft book 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.009
 good a tutorial if you want but not a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 Guadalix tutorial is worth a tutorial 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.820
 on 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.820
 about the psp vale 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.869
 Etc. everything good they have asked me to 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.500
 make a video how to download gta liberty 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.629
 city ​​for psp is worth it because it is a game 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.190
 very funny here is my brother who 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.830
 I can affirm that it is fun because it has 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.830
 played or funny 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.059
 and good what's wrong I'm thinking a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:53.570
 barbarity 815 others or their weight 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.170
 although it is so big 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.170
 all right 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.769
 but as you can see, it 's an image that was undressed 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.040
 and you'll see about 1 meter of um at the moment 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.770
 He puts it in the folder and have it made 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.420
 have to hack the ps3 or good I do not know 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.880
 if there will be another way to put games I 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.979
 I think so 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.469
 I have it good hack and gets into 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.329
 the folder and the tricks of 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:25.970

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.220

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.439
 you want it also has stable this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.009
 what's happening is that a little bit 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.119
 plus 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.200
 - with less graphic and good but also 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.880

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.270
 of Chinese ton for the nintendo I do not know if 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.920

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.870
 good forgives is that my brother believes 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.510
 It takes seven hours to check 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.490

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.490

 good is already very good uruguay quite 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.350
 but Uruguay that bores us because 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.490
 besides that it has a lot of 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.450
 missions 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:40.720

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.070
 that you have already spent the whole thing 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.160
 eliminates and why a 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.200
 outrageous and good not according to 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.280

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.970
