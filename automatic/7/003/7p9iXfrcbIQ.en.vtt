00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
well maybe that's just the gourd getting

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.190 
well maybe that's just the gourd getting
ready<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.450> getting<00:00:36.750> mature

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
ready for you know getting mature

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770 
ready for you know getting mature
getting<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> nice<00:00:37.800> hard<00:00:38.100> brown<00:00:38.399> shell<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.420> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
getting a nice hard brown shell and you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
getting a nice hard brown shell and you
know<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.440> she<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.890> absolutely

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
know what I think she is absolutely

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.619 
know what I think she is absolutely
right

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
right

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
right
I<00:00:42.660> probably<00:00:43.350> should<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.649> left<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I probably should have left this on the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
I probably should have left this on the
vine<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.030> did<00:00:45.719> check<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.110> websites

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
vine I know I did check some websites

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.250 
vine I know I did check some websites
and<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.520> say<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.539> best<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> let<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and they do say it's best to let the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.740 
and they do say it's best to let the
gourds<00:00:50.989> ripen<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.320> harden<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> vine

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
gourds ripen up or harden up on the vine

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.139 
gourds ripen up or harden up on the vine
because<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:54.899> it'll<00:00:55.140> take<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
because then it'll take all the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.340 
because then it'll take all the
nutrients<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> energy<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.140> getting

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
nutrients and energy that it's getting

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.709 
nutrients and energy that it's getting
from<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> vine<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.340> start<00:01:00.090> putting<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.510> not

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
from the vine and start putting that not

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
from the vine and start putting that not
towards<00:01:01.079> getting<00:01:01.379> bigger<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:01.949> towards

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
towards getting bigger and not towards

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
towards getting bigger and not towards
making<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.760> green<00:01:03.030> fleshy<00:01:03.390> stuff<00:01:03.780> but

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
making more green fleshy stuff but

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.980 
making more green fleshy stuff but
rather<00:01:04.760> converting<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> making<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
rather converting to making this you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
rather converting to making this you
know<00:01:07.080> hard<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.090> brown<00:01:09.860> shell<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.549> course

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
know hard you know brown shell of course

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
know hard you know brown shell of course
it's<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> stay<00:01:12.600> green<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's not going to stay green when it's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's not going to stay green when it's
when<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.159> matured<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.210> hardened<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
when it's matured and hardened so the I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
when it's matured and hardened so the I
guess<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> things<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.659> do

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
guess they say one of the things to do

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.920 
guess they say one of the things to do
is<00:01:18.960> let<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.380> wait<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.159> harvest<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
is let is wait and not harvest this

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.130 
is let is wait and not harvest this
until<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:24.229> until<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:26.479> vines<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.810> dried

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
until your until your vines have dried

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.249 
until your until your vines have dried
up<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.270> some<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.420> vines<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.900> dried<00:01:31.229> up

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
up and some of the vines have dried up

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
up and some of the vines have dried up

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.950 
I've been pulling off just today some of
the<00:02:19.290> old<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.770> know<00:02:19.860> dried<00:02:20.430> dead<00:02:20.810> portions<00:02:21.810> of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
the old you know dried dead portions of

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.680 
the old you know dried dead portions of
it<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:23.340> was<00:02:23.670> concerned<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.330> was<00:02:24.510> some

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it and I was concerned that it was some

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.580 
it and I was concerned that it was some
kind<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.310> infection<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:27.330> therefore<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
kind of a infection and therefore I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.620 
kind of a infection and therefore I
didn't<00:02:28.890> want<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.340> make<00:02:29.790> all<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> rest<00:02:30.360> go

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
didn't want it to make all the rest go

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.800 
didn't want it to make all the rest go
bad<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.250> end<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.330> most

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
bad but in the end I think that most

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.110 
bad but in the end I think that most
likely<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:35.550> was<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.410> gourd<00:02:38.120> is

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
likely it was just that the gourd is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.170 
likely it was just that the gourd is
maturing<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:41.040> basically<00:02:41.460> getting

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
maturing that it's basically getting

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.110 
maturing that it's basically getting
ready<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:43.230> able<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.710> have<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.580> nice<00:02:44.790> hard

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
ready to be able to have a nice hard

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.370 
ready to be able to have a nice hard
shell<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.050> last<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.420> probably<00:02:49.050> picked

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
shell and to last so I probably picked

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.780 
shell and to last so I probably picked
that<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.830> early<00:02:50.190> hopefully<00:02:50.670> it'll

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
that one a little early hopefully it'll

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.190 
that one a little early hopefully it'll
still<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.900> still<00:02:52.140> harden<00:02:52.530> up<00:02:52.680> fine<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:55.020> not

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
still is still harden up fine and if not

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.460 
still is still harden up fine and if not
that's<00:02:55.590> okay<00:02:55.980> I've<00:02:56.190> got<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> bunch<00:02:56.670> more<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
that's okay I've got a bunch more and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.940 
that's okay I've got a bunch more and
gardening<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.650> all<00:02:58.950> about<00:03:00.500> trying<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
gardening is all about trying and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.890 
gardening is all about trying and
experimenting<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.030> seeing<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.780> can

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
experimenting and seeing what you can

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.510 
experimenting and seeing what you can
figure<00:03:04.110> out<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.560> learning<00:03:05.130> how<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.250> do<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
figure out and learning how to do it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.699

better next time so hopefully this one

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.850 
better next time so hopefully this one
