Virginia cobia farms technology is based

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.099 
Virginia cobia farms technology is based
on<00:00:16.710> ten<00:00:17.190> years<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.850> innovation<00:00:18.210> effort<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
on ten years of innovation effort and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.710 
on ten years of innovation effort and
has<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.800> been<00:00:20.010> focused<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.460> an<00:00:21.060> apparently

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
has really been focused on an apparently

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140 
has really been focused on an apparently
simple<00:00:22.080> question<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.580> simple<00:00:23.850> question

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
simple question and the simple question

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.349 
simple question and the simple question
is<00:00:24.300> why<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.019> some<00:00:25.410> fish<00:00:25.680> mmm<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.550> catfish<00:00:27.060> or

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
is why do some fish mmm like catfish or

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
is why do some fish mmm like catfish or
perch<00:00:27.570> grow<00:00:28.320> only<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.680> fresh<00:00:29.039> water<00:00:29.250> while

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
perch grow only in fresh water while

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.080 
perch grow only in fresh water while
others<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.630> tuna<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.199> cobia<00:00:31.800> were<00:00:32.489> flounder

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
others like tuna or cobia were flounder

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.069 
others like tuna or cobia were flounder
or<00:00:33.239> cod<00:00:33.450> fish<00:00:33.719> grow<00:00:34.079> only<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.380> seawater<00:00:34.860> mm-hmm

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
or cod fish grow only in seawater mm-hmm

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.720 
or cod fish grow only in seawater mm-hmm
moreover<00:00:37.079> why<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.469> fish<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.010> salmon<00:00:38.280> have

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
moreover why do fish like salmon have

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
moreover why do fish like salmon have
the<00:00:38.850> ability<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.300> move<00:00:39.629> back<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:39.960> forth

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the ability to move back and forth

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.920 
the ability to move back and forth
between<00:00:40.590> fresh<00:00:41.040> water<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.430> sea<00:00:41.610> water<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.690> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
between fresh water and sea water and so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
between fresh water and sea water and so
what<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.200> discovered<00:00:43.440> Marik<00:00:44.190> al<00:00:44.340> has

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
what we discovered Marik al has

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.860 
what we discovered Marik al has
discovered<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.059> answer<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.570> question

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
discovered the answer to that question

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
discovered the answer to that question
and<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:47.039> involves<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> fact<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.450> fish

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and it involves the fact that all fish

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
and it involves the fact that all fish
have<00:00:48.870> inside<00:00:49.500> their<00:00:49.710> bodies<00:00:50.149> particularly

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
have inside their bodies particularly

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.229 
have inside their bodies particularly
cuter<00:00:51.989> sensors<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.190> tiny<00:00:53.520> thermostats

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
cuter sensors like very tiny thermostats

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
cuter sensors like very tiny thermostats
that<00:00:54.989> allows<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> sense<00:00:56.039> whether

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that allows them to sense whether

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
that allows them to sense whether
they're<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.730> fresh<00:00:57.030> water<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.870> seawater

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
they're in fresh water or in seawater

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.830 
they're in fresh water or in seawater
this<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> similar<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> our<00:01:00.030> own<00:01:00.180> bodies<00:01:00.600> we

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this is similar to our own bodies we

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
this is similar to our own bodies we
have<00:01:01.050> our<00:01:01.199> own<00:01:01.320> molecular<00:01:01.890> sensors<00:01:02.340> for

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
have our own molecular sensors for

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
have our own molecular sensors for
instance<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.539> temperature

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
instance for temperature

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.890 
instance for temperature
so<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.400> mara<00:01:05.640> Cal<00:01:05.850> has<00:01:06.030> learned<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.780> how

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so what mara Cal has learned is to how

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710 
so what mara Cal has learned is to how
to<00:01:06.930> regulate<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.920> molecular<00:01:08.720> thermostats

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to regulate these molecular thermostats

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.230 
to regulate these molecular thermostats
so<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.770> essentially<00:01:11.159> reset<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:12.030> or

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so that we can essentially reset them or

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.929 
so that we can essentially reset them or
acclimate<00:01:12.900> them<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.189> by<00:01:14.430> simple

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
acclimate them and we do that by simple

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.960 
acclimate them and we do that by simple
changes<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.900> ratios<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:17.009> concentrations

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
changes in the ratios or concentrations

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.840 
changes in the ratios or concentrations
of<00:01:18.210> salts<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.979> nutrients<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> are<00:01:20.340> added<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
of salts and nutrients that are added to

what has attracted us to this area fish

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.590 
what has attracted us to this area fish
don't<00:01:48.899> suffer<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> result<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.100> our<00:01:50.600> process

don't suffer as a result of our process

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.859 
don't suffer as a result of our process
they<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.500> undergoing<00:01:53.220> stress<00:01:53.869> instead

they are not undergoing stress instead

they are not undergoing stress instead
that<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> process<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.920> much<00:01:56.070> like

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that the process is much like
