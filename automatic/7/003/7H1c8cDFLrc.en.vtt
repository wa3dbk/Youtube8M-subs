guys of me trying my hand at subtle team

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.710 
guys of me trying my hand at subtle team
and<00:00:45.620> all<00:00:46.400> this<00:00:46.610> game<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:46.909> about<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.360> me<00:00:47.510> trying

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
and all this game is about is me trying

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.289 
and all this game is about is me trying
to<00:00:47.900> get<00:00:48.229> those<00:00:48.379> big<00:00:48.710> as<00:00:48.979> bursts<00:00:49.909> out<00:00:50.000> there

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
to get those big as bursts out there

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.180 
to get those big as bursts out there
that's<00:00:50.720> all<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.019> feels<00:00:51.140> like<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.440> spec<00:00:51.650> has<00:00:51.890> is

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
that's all it feels like the spec has is

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.009 
that's all it feels like the spec has is
the<00:00:52.400> burst<00:00:52.699> potential<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.479> it<00:00:53.600> every<00:00:53.870> one

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
the burst potential to it every one

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.630 
the burst potential to it every one
minute<00:00:54.320> outside<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.129> doesn't<00:00:55.280> have<00:00:55.460> any

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
minute outside of it it doesn't have any

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.640 
minute outside of it it doesn't have any
sustained<00:00:56.000> damage<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.510> I'm<00:00:56.629> hoping<00:00:56.870> 6.2<00:00:57.440> does

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
sustained damage and I'm hoping 6.2 does

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.740 
sustained damage and I'm hoping 6.2 does
fix<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.070> for<00:00:58.280> sub<00:00:58.519> two<00:00:58.699> ropes<00:00:58.850> otherwise<00:00:59.600> they

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
fix it for sub two ropes otherwise they

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.729 
fix it for sub two ropes otherwise they
don't<00:00:59.870> really<00:01:00.049> feel<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:00.350> they're<00:01:00.620> doing

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
don't really feel like they're doing

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.829 
don't really feel like they're doing
that<00:01:00.979> much<00:01:01.129> damage<00:01:01.400> but<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:02.180> play<00:01:02.479> style<00:01:02.780> is

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
that much damage but the play style is

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.509 
that much damage but the play style is
very<00:01:02.900> interesting<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:03.739> they<00:01:03.949> application<00:01:04.460> of

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
very interesting and they application of

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.070 
very interesting and they application of
the<00:01:04.610> four<00:01:04.820> piece<00:01:04.970> bonus<00:01:05.210> or<00:01:05.690> something<00:01:05.720> that

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
the four piece bonus or something that

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.840 
the four piece bonus or something that
we<00:01:06.170> could<00:01:06.470> actually<00:01:06.530> really<00:01:07.159> experiment<00:01:07.700> with

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
we could actually really experiment with

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.700 
we could actually really experiment with
as<00:01:08.000> well<00:01:08.450> as<00:01:08.540> how<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.750> line<00:01:09.020> up<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.229> burst<00:01:09.470> and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
as well as how to line up the burst and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.320 
as well as how to line up the burst and
I<00:01:09.740> think<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.040> getting<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.610> little<00:01:11.000> bit<00:01:11.180> better

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
I think I'm getting a little bit better

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.510 
I think I'm getting a little bit better
at<00:01:11.659> it<00:01:11.840> overall<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.890> only<00:01:13.100> knowledge<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.490> have
