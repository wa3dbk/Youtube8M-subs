it<00:01:59.540> was<00:01:59.690> only<00:01:59.870> in<00:02:00.110> March<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.860> year<00:02:01.010> I

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
it was only in March of this year I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.720 
it was only in March of this year I
think<00:02:01.490> far<00:02:02.390> far<00:02:02.780> too<00:02:02.810> late<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.620> we<00:02:04.280> predicted

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
think far far too late that we predicted

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.960 
think far far too late that we predicted
that<00:02:05.150> war<00:02:05.870> was<00:02:06.290> inevitable<00:02:06.940> when<00:02:09.729> 1914<00:02:10.729> I

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
that war was inevitable when 1914 I

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.390 
that war was inevitable when 1914 I
think<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.300> was<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:12.140> dreadfully<00:02:12.800> behind<00:02:13.129> that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
think it was but dreadfully behind that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.250 
think it was but dreadfully behind that
moment<00:02:13.849> fully<00:02:14.450> behind<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:14.989> all<00:02:15.140> this

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
moment fully behind with all this
