 hello we are interested in the saxophone 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.510
 online course this is a big one 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.769
 Information video about the beginners course 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.349
 I would like to give you a short one here 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.189
 give insight into the structure and the 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.109
 learning content of the course and what kind 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.319
 of assistance with questions and 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.759

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.469
 prior knowledge that is to say them 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.350
 would not have to be able to read notes 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.090
 the course really falls to zero at zero 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.370
 therefore requires no prior knowledge 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.989
 I do not care about you either 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.579
 somehow to convey how to 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.769
 as soon as possible on tractors on the 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.629
 instrument or any limb 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.079
 but it really is about that 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.120
 mediation of fundamental 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.550

 in the second hour then it goes 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.580

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.190
 possibilities to contact me 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.940

 either by email or I have one 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.070

 Questions and problems about skype with me 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 to get in contact which is also a 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.370
 very good communication form at 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.170
 I see skype very fast and I listen 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.000
 also very fast where the problems are 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.910
 and came through very targeted 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.220
 help and the experience of the last 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.990
 years has shown that no here 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.080
 really a very useful tool 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.730
 skype dates are usually too 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.500
 to be with me at very short notice 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.230
 just write me a short 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.000
 E-mail and we can usually do that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.600
 on board later have an appointment too 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.600
 make clear 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.460
 with statements of a course travel after 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.710
 You have lessons with me 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.760
 almost a tonal range of two 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.690
 complete octave learned from c1 to 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.300
 to the 23 in this tonumfang we treat 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.280
 also the chromatic scale and we 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.790
 play various receipts 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.270
 up to three cross in 3d sign and c 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.730
 major 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.070
 We also play in the course course 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.320
 many different songs 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.580
 There are different notes here 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.010
 keep coming up 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.160
 that is the whole note the holy minute 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.590
 the quarters are the absolute and the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.290
 later courses also come 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.680
 ported notes before here the ported 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.630
 whole note the dotted ute and the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.220
 dotted lead ote 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.580
 you learn different kinds of 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.040
 phrasing to a nudge sounds 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.080
 We also deal with 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.350
 dynamic means different 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.780
 Volumes of pianissimo in piano 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.670
 piano fair demanded fortissimo 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.960
 There are also important exercises around here 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.960
 to sensitize you to this topic 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.670
 So that was a quick overview of 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.250
 the saxon from beginner course as I said 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.920
 this is not about you in here 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.690
 short time as many tones or 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.410
 to teach any songs but 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.420
 it's really about a solid one 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.670
 Basic knowledge about the saxophone game itself 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.650
 appropriating 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.070
 if you have questions about the saxophone or 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.320

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.430
 Requirements just write me 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.590
 a short e-mail 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.380
 I answer these emails in the 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.240
 usually also in the short term that were 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.310
 So the information about the saxophone 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.170
 beginner course I hope I could you 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.120
