that's 12 fingers and 12 times 5 is 60
see<00:01:53.940> how<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.150> works<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:54.660> you<00:01:54.990> may<00:01:55.260> notice<00:01:55.530> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
see how it works now you may notice that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100 
see how it works now you may notice that
if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.010> multiply<00:01:56.100> 5<00:01:56.880> by<00:01:56.910> an<00:01:57.360> even<00:01:57.690> number

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
if you multiply 5 by an even number

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020 
if you multiply 5 by an even number
you've<00:01:58.470> got<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> Clinton<00:01:59.280> zero<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> if<00:01:59.910> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you've got a Clinton zero and if you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
you've got a Clinton zero and if you
multiply<00:02:00.210> 5<00:02:00.840> by<00:02:00.870> an<00:02:01.200> odd<00:02:01.320> number<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.860> product

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
multiply 5 by an odd number your product

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.959 
multiply 5 by an odd number your product
will<00:02:02.430> end<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:02.760> 5

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
will end in 5
