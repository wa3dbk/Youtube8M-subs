00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.930
 Sinterklaas is out in the country and this one 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.070
 must give way to Christmas 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.990
 and that's why we are going to this video 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.309
 making Christmas cookies because we sat 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.770
 actually a bit our channel too 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.449
 and then fund never fell on it 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.980
 Cookies were made by easy too 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.750
 sounds never did but we 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.400
 unfortunately could not make these cookies together 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.050
 I would have figured it out separately 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.300
 to each other is that every cookie it 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.280
 but water for me at home and that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.840
 sooner than just a video together 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.219
 so in this video three slim 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.219
 especially Christmas cookies 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.230
 for this recipe I am going to make a dough that 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.999
 does not run in the oven and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.679
 you first need 400 grams for this 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.420
 flower needed and it is so much that 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.960
 the cookies stay in good shape 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.359
 in addition 150 grams of white caster sugar 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.519
 200 grams of butter 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.799
 6 bags of vanilla sugar or just 50 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:02.569
 grams of vanilla sugar and last 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.430
 own the first one do the white one 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:07.040
 caster sugar together with the vanilla 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.659
 sugar and butter in a bowl and you go 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.659
 that mixer is a smooth whole 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.320
 now the end can me and mix it for a while 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.320
 well then of the flour 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 As you can see mix, I would first some 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.910
 but then I decide to 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.780
 just take my hands and find that 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.780
 I actually much easier 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.619
 wrap the dough in plastic wrap and air 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.090
 for a minimum of 1 hour in the refrigerator and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.090
 then you can start rolling out 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.289
 of course I will use these shapes 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.789
 for these cookies you were allowed to 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.439
 you can't always have it there 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.439
 just cut with a knife 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.879
 when your entire baking sheet is full of 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.860
 all cookies can use this for 10 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.840
 minutes in a 180-degree oven 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.049
 it on because they should not be too brown 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.049
 to become 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360
 thanks to the houses and each other 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.920
 use the or glaze for this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 to deny this will come later 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.000
 picture for the other cookies 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.560
 when all the houses can stand together 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.940
 you decorate them and do it one too 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.260
 way that you like 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.090
 What do you think assignment is to get them all 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.020
 different because I like this the most 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.020
 give result in writing 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.450
 the whole idea behind this mindy ginger 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.219
 The house is that you can put them on a mug 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.640
 put what is of course very nice 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.640
 look 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.440
 First we just go that cookies 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.630
 make ingredients that you need 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.630
 170 grams of butter 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.100
 150 grams of self-rising flour 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:31.300
 75 grams of sugar 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.630
 a little salt and in a bag 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.630
 vanilla sugar 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.989
 and mix skilled there 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.989
 this also just looks out with your hands 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.330
 to make the cookies perfect 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.330
 use your glass 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.840
 nation very easy of mars pain 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.000
 leaked 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.240
 and so you have a cookie with one and that 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.240
 on it 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.449
 and then we are at the last cookies and 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.699
 I just use the same for this 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.180
 did like the jinn duet houses but this one 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.409
 once I make them dog with a glass of me 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.539
 use for these cookies and cakes 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.159
 nature of doctor oetker and you have to 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.520
 place in a pan with hot water 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.830
 so you can use them by large ones 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.990
 sprinkle with frosting on the cookies and iron 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.909
 these let out with the skewer 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.560
 also the whole cookie and it is not bad 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.909
 if a little bit goes over because it 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.909
 is actually nice again 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.629
 then put a marshmallow on the glaze 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.090
 and this must be the head of the snowman 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.830
 suggest and sign here then leave some 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.870
 nice accessories 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.000
 found a bow tie and some buttons and 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.770
 of course the eyes and their mouths 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.340
 of the snowmen and then yours is 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.340
 actually ready 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.979
 and then all the cookies are finished 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.360
 make an incredibly long time so we would 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.129
