 that the situation does not go to greater the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.870
 blocking is a drastic measure and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 necessary that especially those who are 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.809
 younger you have to take before 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150

 as you see we have eight 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.060
 blocked contacts and to add a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.820
 new good so we click on the 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.190
 blocked let's add here this new 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.650
 and now, well, we can select 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.330
 the contact that we want or we can 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.100

 lower is completely blocked and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 good if you want to unblock it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.810
 we have to give edit and unlock 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 so that's how you unlock and block a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.700
 whatsapp contact as you see is very 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 simple and remember that this tutorial 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 your iphone daily we can receive 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.369
 hundreds of whatsapp messages if 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 We are in family groups, friends or 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.940
 customers the number of messages that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.950
 we receive can be exponentially 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.960
 greater if any of these hundreds of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 messages are accompanied by a picture of 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.190
 July churches saying and you know 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.909
 we can get to have our reel 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.590
 full 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 thanks that we really have not wanted 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.030
 save well then in this short video 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.250
 let's explain how you can eliminate 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.009
 the automatic saving of photos and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 whatsapp videos as you see good 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.479
 Well, what you have to do is open 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.939
 whatsapp go to settings button 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.219
 let's go to settings of chats and how 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.500
 you see here we have auto save files 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.030
 that if we have it off, they do not go 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 to save and once we have 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.069
 disabled this will no longer be saved 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.289
 automatically on the reel the videos 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.849
 and the pictures we have 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.129
 received as you see is a very 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.440
 simple and what we recommend you do 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.970
 so that your reel is of the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 photos and videos that you really want 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.890
 have good if you want to save a little 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.450
 of mobile data on your iphone 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.780
 using the whatsapp app a 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.430
 method a pretty good and that usually 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.030
 to be quite effective is to open 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.340
 Whatsapp 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.349
 let's go to settings of chats and in 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.019
 chat settings let's say auto 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.340
 download multimedia as you see good then 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.709
 here we can select that the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.959
 images are only downloaded with 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.670
 wifi or mobile data and that audio by 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.360
 example and the videos just 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.090
 can be downloaded with wifi with data 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.560
 phones that never download the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.450
 so good that if you are not 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.640
 with a wifi connection that if you are with 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.530
 4g or with 3g and with the technology that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.410
 you use well then that the videos that 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.480
 they usually take up a lot of space and usually 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.950
 consume enough mobile data good 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.989
 so that they do not get discharged is something that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.850
 you are under this wifi technology that 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.550
 As you know, they have no limit 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.310
 download is a pretty simple thing and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.340
 that can be very useful if you have 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.500
 and if you get enough videos or 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.300
 audio and want good for saving a 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.130
 little the amount of mobile data that you 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.269

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.220
 practically indispensable the pass 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.410
 New Year's Eve the company itself indicated that 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.489
