only shallow and there's lots of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.890 
only shallow and there's lots of
undertow<00:03:48.490> you<00:03:48.550> have<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.150> fish<00:03:49.330> bowstring

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
undertow you have to fish bowstring

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.320 
undertow you have to fish bowstring
tight<00:03:50.170> lines<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:50.920> slacking<00:03:51.490> off<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:52.090> just

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
tight lines if you slacking off you just

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.420

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
get a massive bow in them all the lines

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.580 
get a massive bow in them all the lines
can<00:03:54.760> knit<00:03:54.940> together<00:03:55.120> when<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.990> pull<00:03:56.170> up<00:03:56.200> into

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
can knit together when you pull up into

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.990 
can knit together when you pull up into
a<00:03:56.620> fish<00:03:56.860> all<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.310> lines<00:03:57.550> come<00:03:57.730> up<00:03:57.820> together

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
a fish all the lines come up together

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.210 
a fish all the lines come up together
it's<00:03:58.360> just<00:03:58.450> absolutely<00:03:59.080> horrendous<00:03:59.260> and<00:04:00.070> all

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
it's just absolutely horrendous and all

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.040 
it's just absolutely horrendous and all
the<00:04:00.370> guys<00:04:00.550> were<00:04:00.580> really<00:04:01.000> successful<00:04:01.270> in<00:04:01.780> here

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
the guys were really successful in here

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.560 
the guys were really successful in here
all<00:04:02.410> fish<00:04:02.980> really<00:04:03.340> really<00:04:03.790> tight<00:04:04.060> lines<00:04:04.300> so

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
all fish really really tight lines so

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.900 
all fish really really tight lines so
we're<00:04:04.720> doing<00:04:04.900> exactly<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.590> same<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.950> then<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
we're doing exactly the same as then the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.490 
we're doing exactly the same as then the
reason<00:04:07.120> these<00:04:07.390> stones<00:04:07.690> not<00:04:07.930> going<00:04:08.230> off<00:04:08.350> no

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
reason these stones not going off no

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.020 
reason these stones not going off no
matter<00:04:08.650> what<00:04:08.980> wind<00:04:09.220> would<00:04:09.400> get<00:04:09.580> in<00:04:09.730> I'm<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:09.910> at

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
matter what wind would get in I'm in at

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.820 
matter what wind would get in I'm in at
the<00:04:10.090> moment<00:04:10.270> we've<00:04:10.570> got<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.959> brisk<00:04:11.470> northerly

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
the moment we've got a brisk northerly

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.890 
the moment we've got a brisk northerly
it's<00:04:12.370> been<00:04:12.520> almost<00:04:12.670> gale<00:04:13.090> fog<00:04:13.450> since<00:04:13.750> we've

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
it's been almost gale fog since we've

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.630 
it's been almost gale fog since we've
been<00:04:14.050> here<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.890> buzzers<00:04:15.220> are<00:04:15.310> still<00:04:15.489> not

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
been here and the buzzers are still not

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.800 
been here and the buzzers are still not
being<00:04:15.820> going<00:04:16.000> off<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.390> that's<00:04:16.540> because

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
being going off and that's because

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.140 
being going off and that's because
they're<00:04:16.989> set<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.560> right<00:04:17.669> sensitivity<00:04:18.669> so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
they're set on the right sensitivity so

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.120 
they're set on the right sensitivity so
I've<00:04:19.239> got<00:04:19.419> Mon<00:04:19.600> Plus<00:04:19.870> which<00:04:20.560> means<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.950> doesn't

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
I've got Mon Plus which means it doesn't

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.560 
I've got Mon Plus which means it doesn't
take<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.579> much<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.880> actually<00:04:22.150> set<00:04:22.330> them<00:04:22.419> off

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
take so much to actually set them off

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.900 
take so much to actually set them off
the<00:04:22.720> vibration<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.440> picked<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:23.830> quicker<00:04:24.130> but

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
the vibration is picked up quicker but

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.340 
the vibration is picked up quicker but
they're<00:04:25.060> only<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.360> three<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.140> four

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
they're only on three to four

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.060 
they're only on three to four
sensitivity<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.640> move<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.890> see

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
sensitivity so if I move this you see

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.409 
sensitivity so if I move this you see
there<00:04:30.310> there's<00:04:30.520> not<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.730> lot<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:30.940> movement<00:04:31.210> to

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
there there's not a lot of movement to

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.670 
there there's not a lot of movement to
that<00:04:31.600> at<00:04:31.690> all<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.050> since<00:04:32.200> I've<00:04:32.380> been<00:04:32.470> talking

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
that at all but since I've been talking

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.800 
that at all but since I've been talking
the<00:04:33.400> wind<00:04:33.610> doesn't<00:04:33.790> set<00:04:34.060> them<00:04:34.180> off<00:04:34.270> at<00:04:34.390> all<00:04:34.570> so

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
the wind doesn't set them off at all so

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.560 
the wind doesn't set them off at all so
let's<00:04:34.990> imitate<00:04:35.229> a<00:04:35.470> take<00:04:39.180> there<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.270> go<00:04:40.390> so

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
let's imitate a take there you go so

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.570 
let's imitate a take there you go so
it's<00:04:40.690> quite<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.930> lot<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.200> bleeps<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.860> but

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
it's quite a lot of bleeps to that but

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.070 
it's quite a lot of bleeps to that but
the<00:04:42.669> most<00:04:42.820> important<00:04:43.330> thing<00:04:43.510> there<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.930> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
the most important thing there is the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.630 
the most important thing there is the
stone<00:04:44.290> bobbing<00:04:44.710> is<00:04:44.830> falling<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.250> one<00:04:45.430> because

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
stone bobbing is falling the one because

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.730 
stone bobbing is falling the one because
it's<00:04:45.910> semi<00:04:46.210> fixed<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.810> line<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.320> attached

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
it's semi fixed to the line I attached

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.400 
it's semi fixed to the line I attached
that<00:04:47.950> again<00:04:48.570> rather<00:04:49.570> than<00:04:49.810> like<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:49.990> normal

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
that again rather than like a normal

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.840 
that again rather than like a normal
bobbing<00:04:50.770> where<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.130> line<00:04:51.310> will<00:04:51.610> slide

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
bobbing where the line will slide

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.640 
bobbing where the line will slide
through<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.510> actually<00:04:52.630> semi<00:04:53.110> fixed<00:04:53.530> as

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
through it it's actually semi fixed as

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.460 
through it it's actually semi fixed as
it<00:04:54.220> gets<00:04:54.430> pulled<00:04:54.700> for<00:04:55.000> words<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.780> will<00:04:56.020> unclip

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
it gets pulled for words it will unclip

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.140 
it gets pulled for words it will unclip
itself<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.100> even<00:04:57.250> if<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.460> lines<00:04:57.640> only<00:04:57.850> moved

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
itself and even if the lines only moved

that's<00:05:19.030> if<00:05:19.210> we<00:05:19.300> get<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.479> drop<00:05:19.720> back<00:05:19.930> because

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
that's if we get a drop back because

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.170 
that's if we get a drop back because
we're<00:05:20.410> fishing<00:05:20.740> tight<00:05:20.979> sometimes<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.850> do<00:05:21.970> get

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
we're fishing tight sometimes you do get

we're fishing tight sometimes you do get
drop<00:05:22.419> backs<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.870> if<00:05:22.930> I<00:05:23.050> just<00:05:23.229> imitate<00:05:23.680> that

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
drop backs and if I just imitate that

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.540 
drop backs and if I just imitate that
you<00:05:25.720> can<00:05:25.870> see<00:05:26.050> them<00:05:26.290> getting<00:05:26.500> loads<00:05:27.010> of<00:05:27.310> leaks

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550

you can see them getting loads of leaks
on<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.850> del<00:05:28.090> Kim<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.050> extra<00:05:29.979> weight<00:05:30.160> is

on the del Kim and that extra weight is
just<00:05:30.550> helping<00:05:30.910> everything<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.419> pull<00:05:31.600> down<00:05:31.870> and

if I let that back up again you can see
