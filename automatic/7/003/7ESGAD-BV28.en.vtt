00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.020
 the sleigh we are used to seeing 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.830
 stores on advanced shelves and so coffee 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.900
 the car kept it truly automatic

 controls the degree of grinding degree 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.380
 grinding is regulated only when
