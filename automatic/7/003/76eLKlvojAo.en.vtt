00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello girls and boys Alright staff the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.450
 Cold weather is raining here in Rio Grande. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 but it's not the case at all. 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.700
 Creole so today I'm out to 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.520
 record good today as you came here 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.800
 below I'll do a review of this 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 base is replicated mech 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 You found this base there in the shop. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 the renatinha Helita I'll leave 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.650
 he down here and I have a code of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 discount I 'll also leave the link 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.149
 powder was doing a video showing 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 For you, what do I think I found? 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.559
 this base pays off you buy it and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.559
 everything else 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.640
 I do not have this mac base I have to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 this is fixed and that this is a studio 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.340
 Sculpt I do not know how to talk to anyone, but finally. 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.110
 name will be down 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.149
 You can see the packaging she is. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.219
 practically equal to the true 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 ok I did not see much difference it has fps 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.899
 15 I found this very cool and super 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 important for you to use during the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.299
 day and everything 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 the packaging is so my color them and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.180
 25 that the boss sent but I believe that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.150
 be an extra tone then it should be in this 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.470
 30 out there but it worked out too 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.840
 to use was just a little bit 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.830
 but of course with the compact this solves the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.150
 my problem 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 so that's how the lid is rubberized 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.189
 I do not know exactly what this is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.320
 even gives you and you see where it is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 Exit product is super good so here 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 because you can control how much you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.290
 do you want 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.299
 well then I'll apply and I'll put 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.820
 Here, my god, out of my hand, only one 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.079
 a little 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.240
 I pick up a finger and I'm not going to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:55.560
 convention is picking your finger today 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.719
 even though I should be without fringe 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.259
 It's very good, people always happen. 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.259
 forget 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.580
 I already applied, I did not have much 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.380
 A little bit clear, but it's because I do not 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.160
 I spent the dust on top but did not have 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.420
 problem 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.580
 When you go shopping you see the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.680
 Color right, it's good that I have to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.270
 to speak of this basis is as follows: 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.640
 her for a week 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.920
 I tested it every day and what I 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.260
 I noticed it is very dry so it is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.300
 perfect for anyone who has oily skin I 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.640
 I felt that it is well sequinho is in 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.490
 moisturizing base too but she like her 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.640
 it is dry so do not get mad at the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.040
 skin covering is ok but if you go 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.650
 built layer will get heavy then 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.870
 You 're the one who knows how many. 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.570
 layers you want to apply every time 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 that I used the base I used as light 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.630
 it okay 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.250
 usually the replicas these things have 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.500
 a very strong smell and usually 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.170
 and this one I almost do not smell 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.600
 So I really liked that point. 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.750
 positive I did not find a point 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.760
 bad as soon as I say bad 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.970
 I liked it, I think it's worth it. 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.400
 For the price that is is this, people do not have it. 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.970
 Lots of talking I have not even tried the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.680
 base on true but then the tip is 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.650
 for you if you do not want to pay 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.630
 very expensive on a basis this basis it has 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
 lightweight cover is super good super 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.739
 sequine 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.320
 I recommend she tell me if you already 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.450
 they used it if you did not use a 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.400
 experiment on what it's worth then 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.030
 I researched there and she always 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.430
 is as good as it is neither from the base 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.739
 thing she knows then if you have 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.360
 Do you have any question? 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.400
 So I'm going to leave nobody down here at 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.989
 discount code I also hope that 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.120
