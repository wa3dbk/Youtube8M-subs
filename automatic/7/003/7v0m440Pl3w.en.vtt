00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
touchwiz 3.0 touch environment so so

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.060 
touchwiz 3.0 touch environment so so
operation<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.560> should<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.830> very<00:02:30.860> smooth<00:02:31.310> and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070

operation it should be very smooth and
it<00:02:34.070> also<00:02:34.250> has<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.700> 5<00:02:35.390> megapixels<00:02:36.050> camera<00:02:38.530> so

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
it also has a 5 megapixels camera so

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.920 
it also has a 5 megapixels camera so
this<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.130> how<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.430> unlock<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> phone<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.780> we

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
this is how we unlock the phone and we

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.090 
this is how we unlock the phone and we
