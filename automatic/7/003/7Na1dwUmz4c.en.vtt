00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.900
 Hi everyone 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.610
 finally we got to the most part 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.050
 fun and creative tutorial 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.119
 speakers, that is, as yes 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.899
 they build crates by the side 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.790
 the finished one while you can see here 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.829
 if you complete me I'll show you how 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.390
 realizes starting from scratch 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.700
 if you are interested in the project of 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.879
 speakers you can find the links in 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.289
 description and or similar projects 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.940
 of electronics you can write mine 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.390
 channel before starting the part 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.949
 practice 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.300
 let me spend a few words on the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.949
 theory as we have seen in the video 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.690
 precedents are very important 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.089
 parameters concerning the speaking data 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.800
 the most important to the tanks indicates a 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.309
 reference volume to then calculate 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.929
 the volume of the boxing qtc in which tc 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.300
 just a parameter of the 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.550
 boxes that indicate the filtering effect 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.400
 of the case and the volume ratio 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.549
 with the buzzer in my case the volume 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.590
 it is about 70 liters and therefore the 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.830
 cassava of the size chosen is not from 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.300
 30 x 40 x 80 overall with i 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.950
 pins if we consider therefore also i 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.500
 feet the case to the tar about 90 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.180
 inches almost a meter 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.010
 regarding the material the thing 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.390
 It is important that another has an effect 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.220
 effect on the in spite of the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.600
 acoustic honda so for example yes 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.100
 could use reinforced concrete 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.930
 obviously they would become speakers 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.880
 gigantic acoustics and with a weight 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.010
 unacceptable therefore normally yes 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.860
 they use in the tranesity in my case 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.600
 for example use in the 19 mm di f 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.060
 and also the use of restyling in 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.760
 force now once you've developed 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.110
 a project with drawings we can 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.150
 start making our case 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 as you see the wood whose state already 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.900
 cut so as to guarantee a high 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.390
 level of precision in the cuts in way 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.190
 by getting a safe poll you can 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.980
 also cut it yourself apart from using one 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.120
 well calibrated circular making the 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.920
 panel we decided to 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.510
 use as a front is necessary 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.909
 then slide holes to be able to insert myself 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.560
 speakers and out for twitter 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.239
 are made with represented by 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.180
 drill with a few dimensions 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.590
 to be able to win the speaker the hole for 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.180
 the muf was more complex requires 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 use of the jig saw e 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.390
 a cutter we initially practice 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.420
 meanwhile hand circular using 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.090
 alternative secret then we realize the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 hole for 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.720
 it will be the support for the drill he has 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.610
 made for the occasion then with the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.800
 taken we begin to realize the poor 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.250
 for the yes of the book and then take it to 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.530
 level with the front panel we have 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.069
 therefore obtained a hole is a step on the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.019
 which install our boozer 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.030
 be prepared for the details of the measure 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.739
 correct determined by the development of 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.299
 project so pay attention to the fact 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.430
 that the stalls will certainly be more 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.109
 panel costs 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.730
 proceed by gluing the strip 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.560
 and resting in the correct position 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.090
 then it is fixed with clamps 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.459
 checking that the alignment has us 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.290
 correct at this point one is adapted 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.030
 variant useful for assembly and for 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.069
 increase the stability of cash dates 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.409
 in its imposing size therefore 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.139
 fixed strip with screws to the mdf 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.030
 they are made before the holes in the batten 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.069
 to create a guide for the screws in 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.030
 so as not to strain the wood then with 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.890
 the tower life the screws are inserted 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.240
 finally we repeat the operation of 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.900
 fixing the stadiums on the rest 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.900
 panels 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.190
 I added two transverse strips to the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.590
 front panel to reinforce the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.360
 liu support structure for now 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.450
 you will understand the futility of having fixed before 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.790
 and mysteries and panels we make a test 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.110
 to foresee below with then bases 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.970
 we apply plenty of vinyl glue 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.709
 on the various panels to be assembled 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:09.540
 then we install it correctly 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:11.550
 position now always to increase the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 altogether we are the panels 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:26.100
 with screws then like before out a 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:27.810
 fly we use insert the screws for 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.760
 make the case completely watertight 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.560
 we insulate it internally 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.690
 of a substance from 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.980
 reduce librations and then there 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.980
 apply the glass wool on top 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.860
 we begin to cover abundantly with 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.200
 rubber joints and above all 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.550
 the tailings later while 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.710
 expect the rubber to dry 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.140
 we prepare the sheets of glass wool for 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.790
 coating the inner walls so 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:05:10.380
 we coat the walls with antirombo and that 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:12.000
 we apply the lara the preparation of 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.200
 front panel in my case a little 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.580
 particular 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.320
 you need to fix domes for 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.660
 separating the spaces of twitter respect 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.460
 to that of the muf air as I said i 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.560
 twitter I come from a surround system 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.720
 he then dismounted to make one 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.600
 space dedicated to twitter usage 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.610
 domes that were satellites 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.710
 then in the back stall fixing it 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.640
 with 4 nets each then put them back with 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.640
 anti- world rubber 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.399
 now it is necessary to prepare a support 

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.989
 on which the crossover will be fixed 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.419
 so we have support inside 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:48.249
 of the cashier and once connected dear 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.999
 it is installed inside the crossover 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:54.069
 of the case inhabiting the support of the cables 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:57.419
 you will have to get them through the back where 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.419
 the terminal block will be installed 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.490
 finally the time has come for 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.500
 close our cash by fixing the 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.000
 front panel 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.800
 first the front is set up in 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.210
 so as to match it with the rest 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.720
 of assembly by limiting the 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.520
 imperfections you proceed by applying the 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.200
 glue on the junction points so yes 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.860
 install the front by matching it 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.990
 with the underlying part 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.330
 then creating everything in position it is 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.719
 fixed by living in it following system 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.719
 previously 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.150
 we prepare the cables to be able to connect 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.800
 twitter so yes nefarious climate in the 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.050
 cables solder some pieces already 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.460
 ready for twitter and finally isolates 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.820
 all through trouble in termoli 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.820
 shrinkable 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.590
 now we prepare the holes for the screws that 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.590
 they will go to fix the speakers 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.200
 then we place the adhesive war 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.880
 insulating in such a way to mobilize 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.860
 the points of contact between the wood 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.540
 necessary for the speakers 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.220
 finally they are connected and installed 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.220
 speakers fixing all the screws 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.260
 keep in mind that if you have any idea 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.570
 paint the case and add 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.740
 of aesthetic finishes like I will 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.120
 further on 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.800
 I advise you to do all these 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.330
 operations later to dry paint 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.620
 and the case completed 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.930
 well guys now our case is 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.280
 finished there is no lack of finishing touches 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.719
 as you can see here, for example, ha 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.689
 mounted of the rings painted in 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:34.819
 silver and or painted the front the 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:36.919
 back of black and I glued one 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:38.599
 adhesive film as a very effect 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.849
 detail with wood effect also 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:43.120
 very nice to see now I do them to you 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.120
 feel 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.280
 more than one 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:58.280
 good
