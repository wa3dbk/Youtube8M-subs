okay in this video I'm going to briefly
demonstrate<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.890> log<00:00:05.700> system<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.390> we're

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
demonstrate the log system that we're

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.030 
demonstrate the log system that we're
gonna<00:00:06.600> be<00:00:06.660> making<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> upcoming<00:00:07.470> tutorial

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040

video<00:00:49.860> I'm<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> sort<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> introduce<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
video I'm going to sort of introduce the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
video I'm going to sort of introduce the
idea<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.180> logic<00:00:54.180> good<00:00:54.390> logic<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> content

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
idea of logic good logic and content

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.670 
idea of logic good logic and content
separation<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.690> reason<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> good

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
separation the reason that it's a good

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
separation the reason that it's a good
idea<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.010> separate<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.520> logic<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.059> your

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
idea to separate your logic from your

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.450 
idea to separate your logic from your
content<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:02.010> easier<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
content is that it's much easier to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
content is that it's much easier to
maintain<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> say<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> come<00:01:04.589> back

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
maintain so say if you have to come back

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.240 
maintain so say if you have to come back
in<00:01:05.180> like<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.330> month<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.200> make<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> small

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
in like a month or so and make a small

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.920 
in like a month or so and make a small
database<00:01:08.580> change<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.240> rename<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
database change like rename one of the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
database change like rename one of the
columns<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.890> idea<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.340> do<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
columns no idea why do want to do that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.480 
columns no idea why do want to do that
but<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.720> say<00:01:13.369> if<00:01:14.369> use<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:16.100> did<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
but it's just say if use of did all the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.890 
but it's just say if use of did all the
HTML<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.659> PHP<00:01:18.990> SQL<00:01:19.710> query<00:01:20.460> things<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.810> all

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
HTML and PHP SQL query things have all

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.690 
HTML and PHP SQL query things have all
combined<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.820> three<00:01:24.180> files

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
combined in what you are in three files

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.960 
combined in what you are in three files
you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> editing<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:28.670> if<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you know a lot of editing to do if you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.200 
you know a lot of editing to do if you
do<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.270> using<00:01:30.720> functions<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:31.950> classes<00:01:32.210> which

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
do it using functions or classes which

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
do it using functions or classes which
have<00:01:33.240> introduced<00:01:33.960> yet<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.350> I'll<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.590> use

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
have introduced yet so I'll just use

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.760 
have introduced yet so I'll just use
functions<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:36.290> then<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.560> much<00:01:37.710> easier

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
functions for this then it's much easier

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
functions for this then it's much easier
easier<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> edit<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.990> call

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
easier to edit because you just call

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.490 
easier to edit because you just call
those<00:01:40.320> functions<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:42.140> there's<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.290> long<00:01:43.409> as

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
those functions and there's as long as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
those functions and there's as long as
they<00:01:43.560> return<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> same<00:01:44.130> results<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
they return the same results then the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
they return the same results then the
whole<00:01:45.149> system<00:01:45.509> will<00:01:45.630> still<00:01:45.840> work<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
whole system will still work if you just

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.940 
whole system will still work if you just
rename<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> column<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:49.110> yeah<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.530> one

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
rename a column so yeah that's one

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580 
rename a column so yeah that's one
things<00:01:50.220> we're<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> use<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:51.350> talk<00:01:52.350> about

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
things we're going to use or talk about

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.460 
things we're going to use or talk about
in<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.979> video<00:01:53.310> series<00:01:53.960> okay<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.259> I'll<00:01:55.439> just

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
in this video series okay so I'll just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.200 
in this video series okay so I'll just
quickly<00:01:55.649> demonstrate<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.490> open<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.880> blog

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
quickly demonstrate if I open this blog

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.469
