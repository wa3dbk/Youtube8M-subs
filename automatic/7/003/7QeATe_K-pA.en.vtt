and their sedentary animals they don't
move<00:02:16.540> much<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:17.739> don't<00:02:17.890> expend<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.550> lot<00:02:18.580> of

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
move much they don't expend a lot of

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
almost any other region fish so I guess

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.040 
almost any other region fish so I guess
in<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> end<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> day<00:02:25.239> when<00:02:25.540> I'm<00:02:25.660> buying<00:02:25.930> a

in the end of the day when I'm buying a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.990 
in the end of the day when I'm buying a
fish<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.400> tasteless<00:02:27.879> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
fish it's really the tasteless the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.390 
fish it's really the tasteless the
deciding<00:02:28.450> factor<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:28.840> me<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.980> what<00:02:30.160> will<00:02:30.280> be

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
deciding factor for me so what will be

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.800 
deciding factor for me so what will be
the<00:02:30.489> difference<00:02:30.760> between<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.090> taste<00:02:31.299> of<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the difference between the taste of a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
farm turbit and wild turbit there's very

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.420 
farm turbit and wild turbit there's very

dissolved waste harmless to the fish and

dissolved waste harmless to the fish and
the<00:03:19.569> water<00:03:19.780> completes<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.530> cycle<00:03:20.680> again<00:03:21.100> and

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
the proof is that there you see the fish

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.620 
the proof is that there you see the fish
are<00:03:23.230> lying<00:03:23.440> happily<00:03:23.920> happily<00:03:24.280> feeding<00:03:24.940> if<00:03:25.269> the

are lying happily happily feeding if the
