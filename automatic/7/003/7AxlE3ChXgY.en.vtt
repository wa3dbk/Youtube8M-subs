00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
going to show you how you can make your

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.580 
going to show you how you can make your
own<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.000> saw<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> DIY<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:42.989> Martha<00:00:43.200> Stewart

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
own I saw this DIY I'm Martha Stewart

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.560 
own I saw this DIY I'm Martha Stewart
website<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.280> instead<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> using<00:00:44.969> polymer

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
website but instead of using polymer

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
website but instead of using polymer
clay<00:00:45.750> she<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.350> eggshells<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> pipe<00:00:47.910> cleaners

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
clay she use eggshells and pipe cleaners

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.110 
clay she use eggshells and pipe cleaners
I<00:00:48.539> thought<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.469> more<00:00:49.770> durable<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
I thought it would be more durable if I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
I thought it would be more durable if I
was<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.510> try<00:00:51.899> polymer<00:00:52.559> clay<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> guess<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
was to try polymer clay so I guess at a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
was to try polymer clay so I guess at a
try<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.239> experimenting<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.989> different

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
try I was experimenting with different

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
try I was experimenting with different
materials<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.149> turned<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
materials and this just turned out so

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.220 
materials and this just turned out so
beautiful<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.699> looks<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.149> realistic<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
beautiful and it looks so realistic so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.930 
beautiful and it looks so realistic so
I'm<00:01:01.500> excited<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.340> let's<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.730> ahead

you're going to do is knead this use the
wants<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.159> hands<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.600> squeeze<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
wants of your hands to just squeeze this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
wants of your hands to just squeeze this
together<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.130> best<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> way

together as best as you can so that way
you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.750> soften<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> polymer<00:01:40.799> clay<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.369> then

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you can soften the polymer clay and then

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.700 
you can soften the polymer clay and then
later<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.899> shape<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.500> any

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
later on you can to shape this to any

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
later on you can to shape this to any
size<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.909> decided<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.960> want<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
size you like I decided that I want to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.649 
size you like I decided that I want to
give<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.860> marble<00:01:47.310> effect<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.420> at

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
give this a marble effect so I use at

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.859 
give this a marble effect so I use at
3/4<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:50.130> green<00:01:50.880> block<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.840> using

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
3/4 of my green block and then I'm using

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.219 
3/4 of my green block and then I'm using
1/4<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.920> my<00:01:53.520> blue<00:01:53.759> block<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.990> mixing

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
1/4 of my blue block and I'm just mixing

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
1/4 of my blue block and I'm just mixing
them<00:01:55.530> together<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.759> want<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> need<00:01:57.390> both<00:01:57.780> of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
them together you want to need both of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.270 
them together you want to need both of
them<00:01:58.110> separately<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.890> way<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.250> can

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
them separately so that way they can

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.209 
them separately so that way they can
both<00:01:59.579> soften<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.930> combine<00:02:01.409> them<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
both soften and then combine them the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.740 
both soften and then combine them the
great<00:02:02.460> thing<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.570> don't

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
great thing about this is that you don't

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
great thing about this is that you don't
need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> worry<00:02:04.530> about<00:02:04.619> making<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.280> perfect

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
need to worry about making this perfect

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.810 
need to worry about making this perfect
because<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
because the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.219 
because the
more<00:02:06.940> imperfect<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.630> looks<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.020> more

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
more imperfect it looks the more

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.220 
more imperfect it looks the more
realistic<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.009> will<00:02:09.280> look<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.810> your<00:02:10.990> thumb

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
realistic this will look with your thumb

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.400 
realistic this will look with your thumb
and<00:02:11.260> palm<00:02:11.650> press<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.550> clay<00:02:12.760> together<00:02:13.410> forming

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and palm press the clay together forming

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.030 
and palm press the clay together forming
a<00:02:14.560> flat<00:02:14.950> circle<00:02:15.550> like<00:02:15.700> shape<00:02:16.830> from<00:02:17.830> their

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
a flat circle like shape from their

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.949 
a flat circle like shape from their
pinch<00:02:18.400> around<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> edges<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.780> way<00:02:19.900> you

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
pinch around the edges so that way you

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.870 
pinch around the edges so that way you
can<00:02:20.110> form<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.560> bowl<00:02:20.830> like<00:02:21.040> shape<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.730> like

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
can form a bowl like shape just like

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.650 
can form a bowl like shape just like
this<00:02:23.280> after<00:02:24.280> you're<00:02:24.580> done<00:02:24.760> forming<00:02:25.300> your<00:02:25.390> bowl

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
this after you're done forming your bowl

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.780 
this after you're done forming your bowl
what<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.230> want<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.950> bake<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.730> the

every brand is different make sure to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.340 
every brand is different make sure to
let<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> shell<00:02:37.300> completely<00:02:37.930> cool<00:02:38.320> down

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
let the shell completely cool down

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.410 
let the shell completely cool down
before<00:02:39.040> moving<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.940> next<00:02:40.120> step

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
before moving on to the next step

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.810 
before moving on to the next step
alright<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.590> while<00:02:41.830> my<00:02:42.040> other<00:02:42.220> shell<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.640> in

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
alright so while my other shell is in

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.120 
alright so while my other shell is in
the<00:02:42.970> oven<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.200> use<00:02:44.560> these<00:02:44.800> pre-made

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
the oven I'm going to use these pre-made

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.640 
the oven I'm going to use these pre-made
shells<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.970> show<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.810> guys<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.080> next<00:02:47.470> step

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
shells and show you guys the next step

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.770 
shells and show you guys the next step
so<00:02:48.430> let's<00:02:48.459> say<00:02:48.820> after<00:02:49.060> your<00:02:49.510> shell<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
so let's say after your shell is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.110 
so let's say after your shell is
completely<00:02:50.560> cooled<00:02:50.860> down<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.459> next<00:02:51.760> step<00:02:51.940> is

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
completely cooled down the next step is

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.380 
completely cooled down the next step is
to<00:02:52.540> apply<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:53.230> some<00:02:53.500> glue<00:02:53.770> all<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.910> have<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.180> do

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
to apply in some glue all you have to do

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.630 
to apply in some glue all you have to do
is<00:02:55.660> pour<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.320> little<00:02:56.800> bit<00:02:56.920> glue<00:02:57.340> well

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
is pour in a little bit glue well

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910 
is pour in a little bit glue well
actually<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:58.180> suggest<00:02:58.900> for<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.170> pour<00:02:59.709> in<00:02:59.800> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
actually I suggest for you to pour in a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.190 
actually I suggest for you to pour in a
nice<00:03:00.100> generous<00:03:00.610> amount<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.000> glue<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.600> then

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
nice generous amount of glue and then

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.780 
nice generous amount of glue and then
with<00:03:02.500> your<00:03:02.650> foam<00:03:02.920> brush<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.459> brush<00:03:03.760> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
with your foam brush just brush it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.610 
with your foam brush just brush it
around<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.450> make<00:03:04.600> sure<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:05.050> distribute<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
around and make sure to distribute the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.259 
around and make sure to distribute the
glue<00:03:05.830> evenly<00:03:06.070> onto<00:03:06.730> all<00:03:07.450> sides<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:08.080> your<00:03:08.620> shell

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
glue evenly onto all sides of your shell

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.910 
glue evenly onto all sides of your shell
while<00:03:10.269> your<00:03:10.570> glue<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.870> still<00:03:10.959> wet<00:03:11.110> coat<00:03:11.769> it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
while your glue is still wet coat it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.490 
while your glue is still wet coat it
with<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.220> Illuma

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
with the Illuma

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500 
with the Illuma
to<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:14.980> pour<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.580> Illuma<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
to do this is pour in the Illuma and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.970 
to do this is pour in the Illuma and
then<00:03:16.630> shake<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.930> shell<00:03:17.230> around<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.860> way

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
then shake the shell around so that way

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.250 
then shake the shell around so that way
the<00:03:18.160> powder<00:03:18.400> can<00:03:18.790> cover<00:03:19.150> all<00:03:19.420> areas<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:20.080> where

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
the powder can cover all areas of where

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.039 
the powder can cover all areas of where
the<00:03:20.380> glue<00:03:20.590> was<00:03:20.739> applied<00:03:21.390> once<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.840> done

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
the glue was applied once that is done

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.979

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
see it crystallize my first attempt was

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.979 
see it crystallize my first attempt was
a<00:04:06.409> major<00:04:06.769> fail<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.670> didn't<00:04:08.060> crystallize<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.780> me

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
a major fail it didn't crystallize on me

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.110 
a major fail it didn't crystallize on me
and<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.530> had<00:04:09.709> no<00:04:09.890> idea<00:04:09.920> why<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.549> was<00:04:10.700> so

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
and I had no idea why I was so

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.150 
and I had no idea why I was so
discouraged<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.989> then<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:12.440> found<00:04:12.709> out<00:04:12.980> that

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
discouraged and then I found out that

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.610 
discouraged and then I found out that
the<00:04:13.430> Loom<00:04:13.819> powder<00:04:14.060> might<00:04:14.360> be<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.720> problem<00:04:14.959> so

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
the Loom powder might be the problem so

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.439 
the Loom powder might be the problem so
I<00:04:15.650> ordered<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.190> different<00:04:16.549> kind<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:17.060> Elune
