00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
stretching that I didn't put in here but

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.900 
stretching that I didn't put in here but
basically<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.190> loosening<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
I'm actually pretty happy because I

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.549 
I'm actually pretty happy because I
still<00:01:01.920> hit<00:01:02.100> her<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.600> 3435<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> didn't

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
still hit her like a 3435 so I didn't

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.250 
still hit her like a 3435 so I didn't
lose<00:01:04.830> which<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.369> thought<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> would<00:01:06.260> getting

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:55.629 

I<00:03:51.010> don't<00:03:52.010> want<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.310> be<00:03:53.379> an<00:03:54.379> icon

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
I don't want to be an icon

represent and idea I want to look for a

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.270 
represent and idea I want to look for a
top-speed<00:04:03.049> exercise<00:04:03.650> today<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:03.950> wanted<00:04:04.220> to

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
top-speed exercise today I wanted to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.949 
top-speed exercise today I wanted to
share<00:04:04.519> with<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.819> guys<00:04:04.849> something<00:04:05.269> and<00:04:05.870> I

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
share with you guys something and I

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.990 
share with you guys something and I
think<00:04:06.200> is<00:04:06.349> such<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> simple<00:04:07.099> tool<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.819> can

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
think is such a simple tool you can

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.330 
think is such a simple tool you can
utilize<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:09.019> correct<00:04:09.409> a<00:04:09.530> lot<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:09.799> your<00:04:10.069> top

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
utilize to correct a lot of your top

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.729 
utilize to correct a lot of your top
speed<00:04:10.519> so<00:04:11.120> often<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.629> talk<00:04:11.689> about<00:04:12.079> the

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
speed so often I talk about the

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.039 
speed so often I talk about the
mechanics<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.670> lower<00:04:13.849> body<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.480> cycling

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
mechanics of the lower body and cycling

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.920 
mechanics of the lower body and cycling
when<00:04:15.230> you're<00:04:15.379> in<00:04:15.500> top<00:04:15.709> speed
