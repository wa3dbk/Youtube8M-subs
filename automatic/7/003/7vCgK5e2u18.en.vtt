one of the best secondary weapons in the
game<00:06:58.280> that's<00:06:59.270> why<00:06:59.600> I<00:06:59.960> hope<00:07:00.530> that<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.460> shotguns

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
game that's why I hope that the shotguns

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.600 
game that's why I hope that the shotguns
in<00:07:02.560> modern<00:07:03.560> warfare<00:07:03.620> 3<00:07:03.890> are<00:07:04.220> gonna<00:07:04.460> be

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
in modern warfare 3 are gonna be

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.150 
in modern warfare 3 are gonna be
justified<00:07:05.300> not<00:07:05.780> I<00:07:05.990> truly<00:07:06.710> hope<00:07:06.950> they're<00:07:07.130> not

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
justified not I truly hope they're not

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.400 
justified not I truly hope they're not
gonna<00:07:07.400> be<00:07:07.550> somewhat<00:07:08.060> overpowered<00:07:08.690> now<00:07:09.350> we

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
gonna be somewhat overpowered now we

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.260 
gonna be somewhat overpowered now we
