00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.970
 Welcome to the new video on mine 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.800
 channel 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.570
 you have a little tutorial about this 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.370
 fountain and something else 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.860
 But what else will you do later? 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.439
 I'll show you, I'll show you 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.480
 works even then, you've already 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.189
 seen what he did what he his 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.130
 klop the always runs through forget 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.120
 that on the spot 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 Anyway, no matter is a clock and the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.170
 is then later to another purchase 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.030
 attached you can see me already 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.980
 something looks right now that's right 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.360
 already fits with the interval I think 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.880
 Well, it did not matter 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.740
 anyway, it goes on now 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.560
 I build here do not lose up 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.050
 so that something happens to her too 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.210
 is a compact to be bugged by 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.299
 The plant makes here 20 times 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.970
 comes right after you get signal 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.640
 Rhein and the blog is activated here 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.700
 yes that is actually very simple and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.140
 that can be any replica of the command 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.830
 I'll write you the one here too 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.020
 description so the cutter individually and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.060
 that is actually quite simple go 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.159
 you just have to enter your coordinates 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.159
 but that also creates a good one 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:37.720
 let's get jigsaw build this 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.720
 now still quickly unsubscribe the stupid 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.750
 look what gets cut off happens 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.000
 asks juncker not 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.090
 the whole now with or city after 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.430
 somehow totally broken 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.690
 here is second this is a cannon the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.950
 you do not have to reload it, you just have to 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.570
 with a command block and a 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.450
 knock maps and throws the button 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.770
 the first time the shot down and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.420
 then just rescues the hand 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.490
 Take that away and build it again quickly 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.940
 then you have a clock and build 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.590
 it is automatically shot away here 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.150
 that works on its own 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.680
 field including a crater the but 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.560
 that's what I did before 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.140
 already tested the command 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.090
 here in the month, they still collect the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.240
 coordinate over it and then behind 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.490
 tactically I have a description for you 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.260
 yes it was actually from the video 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.790
 I hope you liked it because and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.750
 helped we have one more 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.500
 nice to finish one 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.290
 sunset 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.030
 I wish you much fun with the sharp 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.530
 comments rated the video and me 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.530
 Do not just hope her back a bit
