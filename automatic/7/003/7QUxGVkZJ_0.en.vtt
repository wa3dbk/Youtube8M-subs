even need a cloak if he's got such
powerful<00:01:29.490> armor<00:01:30.030> well<00:01:30.720> I'm<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.079> too<00:01:31.380> sure<00:01:31.650> but

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
powerful armor well I'm not too sure but

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.910 
powerful armor well I'm not too sure but
there<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.460> theories<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> why<00:01:33.619> first<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
there are theories as to why first you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.039 
there are theories as to why first you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
can see his helmet is cracked and this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
can see his helmet is cracked and this
could<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.409> an<00:01:37.500> indicator<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.130> poor<00:01:38.490> suit

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
could be an indicator a poor suit

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.359 
could be an indicator a poor suit
integrity<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:40.409> might<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.740> even<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.220> his

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
integrity or he might not even have his

integrity or he might not even have his
full<00:01:41.579> suit<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.689> theories<00:01:43.140> include<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> he

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
full suit more theories include that he

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
full suit more theories include that he
is<00:01:44.009> protecting<00:01:44.520> himself<00:01:44.670> against<00:01:45.240> sand

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
is protecting himself against sand
getting<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.049> his<00:01:46.110> armor<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.280> he<00:01:47.460> can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
getting in his armor or so he can

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
getting in his armor or so he can
conceal<00:01:47.939> his<00:01:48.149> identity<00:01:48.560> evidence<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> he<00:01:49.890> is

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.849 
game will release in 2014 probably late
2014<00:03:38.159> and<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:39.090> coming<00:03:39.419> back<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.599> e3<00:03:39.870> next<00:03:40.409> year

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
2014 and be coming back to e3 next year

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.189 
2014 and be coming back to e3 next year
so<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.459> guess<00:03:41.669> all<00:03:41.879> that's<00:03:42.000> left<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.659> play

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
so I guess all that's left is to play

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.589 
so I guess all that's left is to play
the<00:03:43.379> year-long<00:03:43.650> waiting<00:03:44.280> game<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:45.180> that's<00:03:45.359> all

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
the year-long waiting game so that's all

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.719 
the year-long waiting game so that's all
