00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 Hi, I am Maya. I'm going to tell you today 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.300
 how you can get your hair nice and loose, beautiful, naturally full. 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.699
 Well, as the first step 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.479
 I always use AndrÃ©lon's Get The Volume mousse myself. 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.879
 It is very nice and naturally provides volume 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 Not too much, half a mandarin. 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.750
 And apply to the top of your hair. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.480
 Blow-dry your hair as usual. 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.480
 I use a difuser. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 And if you lean forward a little, you get even more volume. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.610
 The Heat Protect Spray is the first spray. In the length of your hair. 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.970
 For protection against the heat of the curling iron. 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.100
 And then we start with curls. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.380
 And so you do that pluck for pluck. 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.520
 So. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 And then you do that around your entire head. 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.320
 That was the last one. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.970
 And to get it a bit more stiff and wild 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.350
 use the Get The Volume Powder. 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.630
 And you do that pluck for pluck. 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.390
 Then you all make small different separations. 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380
 So. Not too much. 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.630
 Different... 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.150
 Do you also feel that it is becoming too stiff. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.950
 And for a nice stroke 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.070
 I use the Go For Texture Beach Spray. 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.430
 So. 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.730
 Also a bit on the dots. 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.670
 And the other side. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.720
 And then with my hand a bit through it 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.840
 so it's a bit on one side. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.980
 And to top it off, the Extra Strong Hold hairpsray. 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.870
 So that it stays natural in its model. 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.509
 And that it stays nice and strong. So. 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.680
 The other side too. 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.429
 And voila. 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:18.949
 Loose, but then the full coup.
