when<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.770> you're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
when you're going like this you're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.400 
when you're going like this you're
basically<00:02:05.640> creating<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.450> rough<00:02:06.750> edge<00:02:07.020> even

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
basically creating a rough edge even

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.350 
basically creating a rough edge even
though<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:07.710> may<00:02:07.860> feel<00:02:08.160> smooth<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.880> still

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
though it may feel smooth it's still

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.060 
though it may feel smooth it's still
above<00:02:09.630> ang<00:02:09.900> it's<00:02:10.110> kind<00:02:10.290> of<00:02:10.350> like<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> split<00:02:10.920> in

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
above ang it's kind of like a split in

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.970 
above ang it's kind of like a split in
right<00:02:11.370> file<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.990> same<00:02:13.230> direction<00:02:13.470> now

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
right file is the same direction now

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.800
