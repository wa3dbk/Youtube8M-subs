00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
about geometry keyboard shortcuts okay

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.000 
about geometry keyboard shortcuts okay
let's<00:00:05.850> go<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.150> here<00:00:06.180> everybody<00:00:06.690> knows<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.799> B

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
let's go in here everybody knows the B

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.980 
let's go in here everybody knows the B
key<00:00:08.250> hit<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.790> B<00:00:08.910> key<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.269> click<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> activate

key hit the B key and click the activate
it<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.260> activates<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> bevel<00:00:11.580> tool<00:00:11.809> okay

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it it activates the bevel tool okay

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.259 
it it activates the bevel tool okay
actually<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.070> edge<00:00:14.400> bevel<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
actually it's the edge bevel and the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.720 
actually it's the edge bevel and the
shift<00:00:15.780> B<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.320> polygon<00:00:16.890> bevel<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.430> most

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
shift B is the polygon bevel but most

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.980 
shift B is the polygon bevel but most
the<00:00:17.820> time<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.240> won't<00:00:18.390> tell<00:00:18.630> much<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the time you won't tell much of a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.580 
the time you won't tell much of a
difference<00:00:19.400> okay<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:20.640> there's<00:00:20.880> alt<00:00:21.210> B<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.529> in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
difference okay then there's alt B as in

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.089 
difference okay then there's alt B as in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
right okay now we got the C key which is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
right okay now we got the C key which is
the<00:01:12.000> edge<00:01:12.180> slice<00:01:12.659> tool<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.530> go<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the edge slice tool I can go in here and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
the edge slice tool I can go in here and
select<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.610> edge<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.090> how<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.330> my

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
select my edge you see how that's my

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.730 
select my edge you see how that's my
edge<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.049> click<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> push<00:01:16.619> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
edge and I can click and push that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
edge and I can click and push that
little<00:01:16.860> point<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> edge<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.119> slice

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
little point on the edge and I can slice

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.350 
little point on the edge and I can slice
between<00:01:18.840> edges<00:01:19.549> okay<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:27.060> C

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
between edges okay so that's the the C

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
between edges okay so that's the the C
key<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:29.270> copy<00:01:30.290> okay<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:32.009> there's<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
key as in copy okay then there's the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.080 
key as in copy okay then there's the
poly<00:01:32.579> knife<00:01:32.909> tool<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.509> shift<00:01:34.170> C<00:01:34.710> shift<00:01:35.700> C

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
poly knife tool which is shift C shift C

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.520 
poly knife tool which is shift C shift C
gives<00:01:36.360> us<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> poly<00:01:36.780> knife<00:01:37.020> tool<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
now as you can see i'm putting this cut

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.760 
now as you can see i'm putting this cut
right<00:01:46.229> through<00:01:46.259> there

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
okay and as you can see the slice tool

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.609 
okay and as you can see the slice tool
is<00:01:52.520> activated<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.210> now<00:01:53.929> i'm<00:01:54.079> just<00:01:54.259> using<00:01:54.439> this

is activated and now i'm just using this

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.169 
is activated and now i'm just using this
plane<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.189> make<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:55.460> slice<00:01:55.759> all<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> way

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
plane to make this slice all the way

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.359 
plane to make this slice all the way
across<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.420> top<00:01:56.719> here<00:01:56.799> if<00:01:57.799> i<00:01:57.920> want<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.219> maybe

across the top here if i want to maybe

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.660 
across the top here if i want to maybe
cut<00:01:58.700> down<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.060> way<00:01:59.299> i<00:01:59.590> can<00:02:00.590> hit<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.159> shift<00:02:01.399> C

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
cut down this way i can hit the shift C

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.190 
cut down this way i can hit the shift C
key<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:05.030> cut<00:02:05.270> right<00:02:05.450> down<00:02:05.479> through<00:02:05.810> there<00:02:05.990> you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
key and cut right down through there you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.309 
key and cut right down through there you
can<00:02:06.799> see<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.039> gives<00:02:07.280> me<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.520> cut<00:02:07.789> there<00:02:08.319> okay

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
can see it gives me that cut there okay

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.020 
can see it gives me that cut there okay
let's<00:02:10.009> shift<00:02:10.429> see<00:02:11.739> now<00:02:12.739> there<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.730> let's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
let's shift see now there is the let's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.390 
let's shift see now there is the let's
see<00:02:14.269> what<00:02:14.540> else<00:02:14.569> at<00:02:14.870> me<00:02:14.989> think<00:02:15.349> that's<00:02:16.250> the

see what else at me think that's the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.860 
see what else at me think that's the
poly<00:02:16.610> knife<00:02:16.879> then<00:02:17.120> there's<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.390> loop<00:02:17.569> slice

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
poly knife then there's the loop slice

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.600 
poly knife then there's the loop slice
which<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.470> slightly<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.129> select<00:02:19.459> the

drag<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:56.730> see<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:57.120> smooths<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.870> out

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
drag you can see that smooths that out

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.350 
drag you can see that smooths that out
now<00:04:58.470> it's<00:04:58.680> all<00:04:58.800> tight<00:04:59.070> in<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.850> corners<00:05:00.090> are

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
now it's all tight in the corners are

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.440 
now it's all tight in the corners are
sharp<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.320> click<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.770> drag<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.970> smooth

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
sharp and I click and drag it smooth

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.710 
sharp and I click and drag it smooth
those<00:05:04.110> corners<00:05:04.530> out<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.980> know<00:05:05.390> that's<00:05:06.390> the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
those corners out you know that's the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.790 
those corners out you know that's the
smooth<00:05:07.650> tool<00:05:08.100> or<00:05:08.400> they<00:05:08.610> shift<00:05:08.910> s<00:05:09.500> then<00:05:10.500> there's

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
smooth tool or they shift s then there's

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.770 
smooth tool or they shift s then there's
the<00:05:10.860> let's<00:05:11.160> go<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.340> edge<00:05:11.460> mode<00:05:11.700> then<00:05:12.570> there's

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
the let's go to edge mode then there's

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.070 
the let's go to edge mode then there's
the<00:05:12.840> edge<00:05:13.080> spin<00:05:13.770> which<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.610> V<00:05:14.910> key<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.510> you

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
the edge spin which is the V key and you

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.750 
the edge spin which is the V key and you
can<00:05:16.200> see<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.470> twisted<00:05:16.980> that<00:05:17.130> edge<00:05:17.400> right

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
can see it twisted that edge right

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.230 
can see it twisted that edge right
around<00:05:18.000> there<00:05:18.240> two<00:05:18.870> spins<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.620> edge<00:05:20.180> so<00:05:21.180> if

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
around there two spins the edge so if

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.700 
around there two spins the edge so if
you<00:05:21.300> need<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.540> line<00:05:21.750> up<00:05:21.930> some<00:05:21.960> edges<00:05:22.410> or<00:05:22.560> line

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
you need to line up some edges or line

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.710 
you need to line up some edges or line
up<00:05:22.860> your<00:05:22.890> geometry<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.580> just<00:05:23.730> hit<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:24.030> V<00:05:24.480> key

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
up your geometry you just hit the V key

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.350 
up your geometry you just hit the V key
and<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.990> spins<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.590> for<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:26.000> what<00:05:27.000> else<00:05:27.180> is

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
and it spins it for you what else is

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.750 
and it spins it for you what else is
there<00:05:27.660> there's<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.590> F<00:05:28.740> key<00:05:28.770> which<00:05:29.310> will<00:05:29.340> flip

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
there there's the F key which will flip

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.370 
there there's the F key which will flip
your<00:05:29.940> polygons<00:05:30.360> as<00:05:30.510> you<00:05:30.600> can<00:05:30.720> see<00:05:30.900> now<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.050> can't

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
your polygons as you can see now I can't

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.380 
your polygons as you can see now I can't
see<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.620> what<00:05:32.220> happened<00:05:32.580> my<00:05:32.669> polygon<00:05:33.060> where'd

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
see it what happened my polygon where'd

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.630 
see it what happened my polygon where'd
it<00:05:33.510> go<00:05:33.630> well<00:05:34.380> there<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.860> is<00:05:34.950> it's<00:05:35.220> just<00:05:35.460> flipped

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
it go well there it is it's just flipped

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.130 
it go well there it is it's just flipped
around<00:05:35.760> get<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.450> F<00:05:36.540> key<00:05:36.570> and<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.900> flips<00:05:37.080> a

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
around get the F key and it flips a

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.950 
around get the F key and it flips a
terrific<00:05:37.730> tab<00:05:38.730> key<00:05:39.060> moves<00:05:39.090> your<00:05:39.690> mesh<00:05:39.870> out

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.840 

shift<00:05:45.770> V<00:05:46.069> mirrors<00:05:46.669> your<00:05:49.090> geometry<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:51.850> that's

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
shift V mirrors your geometry and that's

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.059 
shift V mirrors your geometry and that's
it<00:05:52.970> for<00:05:53.180> now<00:05:53.360> we'll<00:05:54.080> cover<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.440> more<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.770> the
