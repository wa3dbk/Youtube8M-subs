00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.280
 I am the director of the totem on 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.800
 Kiev, we entered the repair 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.270
 car volkswagen golf plus with 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.920
 damage to the paintwork 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.439
 rear right door 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:25.010
 and now I will tell you how we will 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.750
 repair this damage in this 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.390
 case 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.020
 damaged paintwork and 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.570
 there is a slight deformation 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.749
 metal form small dent dent 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.850
 we will delete in an unconventional way 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.999
 we will not use such material 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.280
 as a bite about technology applied 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:45.129
 Paintless dent removal and further 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.300
 let's make local coloring 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.010
 damaged area many 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.319
 motorists believe that local 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.769
 painting is coloring directly 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:57.829
 damage site but want to assure you 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.109
 what is it not theoretically to do it 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.690
 maybe but the result will not justify 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.360
 hopes since clear lines will be visible 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.030
 painting place so that it does not 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.190
 happened we need to seamlessly integrate 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.620
 Our repair material is factory 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.640
 car painting area given 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.360
 repair will be approximately here 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.360
 such a plot 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.280
 dents wizard finished his 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.890
 the job 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.930
 the geometry is restored and now we 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.420
 let's proceed to the next stage of our 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.549
 repair namely preparing for local 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 coloring for this we need to remove 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.020
 door handle and molding 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.200
 while preparing for the paint 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.390
 each colorist starts his work 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.420
 car manufacturer has its 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.820
 individual code this code we enter in 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.770
 program and we get a recipe for 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.900
 paint preparation for perfect 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.270
 color matching in tinting produce 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.120
 damaged parts directly or 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:56.100
 on mated car parts and so 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.740
 all the preparatory work is complete 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.420
 completed and we start directly 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.490
 painting damaged parts 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.140
 painting will be done in three 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.300
 stages first stage application of soil 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 Phase two of the plan integrates basic 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.830
 cover 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.930
 car colors and the third stage home 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.930
 lacquer integration factory coating 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.370
 so the coloring is complete and we see with you 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.640
