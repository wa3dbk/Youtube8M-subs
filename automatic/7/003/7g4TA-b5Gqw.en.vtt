00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:48.009 

you<00:03:37.920> know<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.189> that<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.670> dull<00:03:38.909> base

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.910 

for<00:04:05.640> film<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.210> tend<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.170> both<00:04:07.500> pickups

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
for film I tend to do just both pickups

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.240 
for film I tend to do just both pickups
everything<00:04:08.850> flat<00:04:09.150> same<00:04:09.600> base<00:04:09.810> same<00:04:10.230> specs<00:04:10.620> the

everything flat same base same specs the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.650 
everything flat same base same specs the
only<00:04:11.460> thing<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.760> changes<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.300> it's

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
only thing that changes is that it's

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.190 
only thing that changes is that it's
tuned<00:04:13.140> low<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.910> see<00:04:15.120> sharp<00:04:15.390> F<00:04:15.840> sharp<00:04:16.160> B<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.430> E

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
tuned low to see sharp F sharp B and E

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:28.430 
tuned low to see sharp F sharp B and E
right<00:04:26.060> right<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.330> he<00:04:27.690> cuts<00:04:27.960> right<00:04:28.200> through

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
right right and he cuts right through

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.160 
right right and he cuts right through
because<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.800> my<00:04:29.040> mg<00:04:29.400> axis<00:04:29.790> they<00:04:30.630> got<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.960> power

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
because of my mg axis they got the power

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.130 
because of my mg axis they got the power
to<00:04:31.580> project<00:04:32.580> those<00:04:32.790> low<00:04:33.030> tunings<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.900> make

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
to project those low tunings and make

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.750 
to project those low tunings and make
them<00:04:34.290> cool<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.890> know<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.310> can<00:04:35.460> hear

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
them cool you know and so you can hear

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.970 
them cool you know and so you can hear
them<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.030> it's<00:04:36.330> not<00:04:36.510> just<00:04:36.570> mud<00:04:37.080> up<00:04:37.350> there<00:04:37.620> you

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
them so it's not just mud up there you

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:45.170 
them so it's not just mud up there you
know<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.910> do<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.180> lab<00:04:39.450> too<00:04:43.670> so<00:04:44.670> just<00:04:45.030> my

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
know you can do this lab too so just my

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.640 
know you can do this lab too so just my
point<00:04:45.390> is<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.960> does<00:04:46.170> translate

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
point is that it does translate

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.580 
point is that it does translate
beautifully<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.880> know<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.090> mean<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:49.350> seem

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
beautifully you know I mean you seem

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.140 
beautifully you know I mean you seem
with<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.800> same<00:04:50.040> kind<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.430> pickups<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.940> same

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
with the same kind of pickups the same

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.630 
with the same kind of pickups the same
kind<00:04:51.420> of<00:04:51.480> base<00:04:51.690> doing<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.620> low<00:04:52.890> tune<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.370> how

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
kind of base doing it low tune in how

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.910 
kind of base doing it low tune in how
you<00:04:53.700> can<00:04:53.970> use<00:04:54.090> one<00:04:54.360> base<00:04:54.570> for<00:04:54.810> one<00:04:54.960> gig<00:04:55.200> no

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
you can use one base for one gig no

have both pickups going you tend to have

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.130 
have both pickups going you tend to have
some<00:05:32.640> kind<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.940> cancellation<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.870> lose<00:05:34.110> a

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
some kind of cancellation so you lose a

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.800 
some kind of cancellation so you lose a
little<00:05:34.440> bit<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.740> level<00:05:35.550> or<00:05:35.970> when<00:05:36.420> you<00:05:36.570> have<00:05:36.780> a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
little bit of level or when you have a

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.470 
little bit of level or when you have a
balance<00:05:37.320> di<00:05:37.580> then<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:39.000> don't<00:05:39.150> have<00:05:39.300> that

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
balance di then you don't have that

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.840 
balance di then you don't have that
