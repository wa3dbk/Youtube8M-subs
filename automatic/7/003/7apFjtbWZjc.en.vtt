00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
believed but for fear of the Jews they

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.030 
believed but for fear of the Jews they
wouldn't<00:03:44.940> confess<00:03:45.360> his<00:03:45.600> name<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.920> know

wouldn't confess his name you know

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
because they loved the praise a man

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.810 
because they loved the praise a man
better<00:03:49.350> than<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.590> praises<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.010> God<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.700> know

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
better than the praises of God you know

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.850 
better than the praises of God you know
so<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.930> were<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.290> know<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.560> even

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.560 
so like so there were you know so even
though<00:03:52.950> they<00:03:53.100> believed<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
though they believed that the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.970 
though they believed that the
implication<00:03:55.080> is<00:03:55.170> they<00:03:55.410> weren't<00:03:55.709> saved

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
implication is they weren't saved

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.740 
implication is they weren't saved
because<00:03:56.250> they<00:03:56.489> never<00:03:56.640> confessed<00:03:57.269> his<00:03:57.510> name

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
