grind the knives down to where you have
a<00:00:23.010> rough<00:00:23.369> pass<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.170> only<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
a rough pass and then it's only going to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.910 
a rough pass and then it's only going to
take<00:00:25.650> three<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:26.220> four<00:00:26.359> final<00:00:27.359> passes<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.619> clean

it<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> look

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it up this is what it's going to look

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.350 
it up this is what it's going to look
like<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.070> where<00:00:35.360> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
like and you get it down to where you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.819 
like and you get it down to where you
can<00:00:36.390> actually<00:00:36.660> start<00:00:37.050> working<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
can actually start working with it and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.069 
can actually start working with it and
then<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.390> looks<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
then this is what it looks like on the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.880 
then this is what it looks like on the
finish<00:00:40.410> pass<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:42.719> needs<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.170> little<00:00:43.290> sanding

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
finish pass this needs a little sanding

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
finish pass this needs a little sanding
it'll<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> go

when grinding your knives you want to
start<00:00:52.840> at<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.079> peak<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.710> work<00:00:54.129> your<00:00:54.280> way<00:00:54.489> down

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
start at the peak and work your way down

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.069 
start at the peak and work your way down
into<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.420> valleys<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.690> way<00:00:58.899> you<00:00:58.960> don't

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
into the valleys this way you don't

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.290 
into the valleys this way you don't
flicks<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.829> blade<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.670> won't<00:01:00.850> get<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.059> bad

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
flicks the blade and you won't get a bad

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.460 
flicks the blade and you won't get a bad
cut<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:07.270> there<00:01:07.450> here<00:01:07.780> phille<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.110> grind<00:01:08.320> on<00:01:08.440> a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
cut be there here phille and grind on a

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.870 
cut be there here phille and grind on a
knife<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.149> just<00:01:10.360> happen<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:11.490> strike<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.729> a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
knife if you just happen to strike it a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.600 
knife if you just happen to strike it a
little<00:01:13.240> too<00:01:13.390> hard<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:14.259> could<00:01:14.590> Nick<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.430> knife

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
little too hard it could Nick the knife

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.850 
little too hard it could Nick the knife
then<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.509> would<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.869> grind<00:01:17.170> all<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.710> them

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
then you would have to grind all of them

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.080 
then you would have to grind all of them
back<00:01:18.549> down<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.630> get<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:19.840> Nick<00:01:20.200> out

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.459 

you<00:01:27.090> keep<00:01:27.329> doing<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.020> keep<00:01:28.200> working

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
you keep doing this you keep working

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.209 
you keep doing this you keep working
this<00:01:28.770> technique<00:01:30.649> through<00:01:31.649> all<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:32.009> knives

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
this technique through all your knives

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.800 
this technique through all your knives
and<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:34.380> you'll<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.710> back<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.600> just<00:01:36.600> take

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and then you'll go back and just take

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.010 
and then you'll go back and just take
off<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> couple<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.740> thousands<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:39.539> finish<00:01:39.869> them

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
off a couple of thousands to finish them

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
off a couple of thousands to finish them
up<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:43.200> way<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.470> ensure<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.250> everyone's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
up this way you ensure that everyone's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.480 
up this way you ensure that everyone's
going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.509> exactly<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
going to be exactly the same and the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.490 
going to be exactly the same and the
weight<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> same<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.259> very

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
weight will be the same that's very

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370 
weight will be the same that's very

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
important for balance you can tell it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.169
