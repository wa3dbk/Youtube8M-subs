00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
all they just seem to float in the air

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440 
all they just seem to float in the air
that's<00:02:52.709> why<00:02:52.950> they're<00:02:53.160> known<00:02:53.400> as<00:02:53.700> floating

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
that's why they're known as floating

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.640 
that's why they're known as floating
ribs

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.410 

remember<00:02:58.650> back<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.860> part<00:02:59.220> one<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.879> discussed

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
remember back in part one we discussed

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.240 
remember back in part one we discussed
how<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.690> skeletal<00:03:01.349> system<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.769> divided<00:03:02.069> into

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
how the skeletal system is divided into

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.460 
how the skeletal system is divided into
two<00:03:02.489> parts<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.090> axial<00:03:03.810> skeleton<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
two parts the axial skeleton and the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.350 
two parts the axial skeleton and the
appendicular<00:03:04.709> skeleton<00:03:05.459> well<00:03:06.000> guess<00:03:06.150> what

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
appendicular skeleton well guess what

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.820 
appendicular skeleton well guess what
now<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:06.959> we<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.230> finished<00:03:07.470> discussing

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
now that we have finished discussing

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.070 
now that we have finished discussing
about<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.310> ribcage<00:03:08.519> we<00:03:09.360> have<00:03:09.569> finished<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
about the ribcage we have finished the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.860 
about the ribcage we have finished the
entire<00:03:10.200> axial<00:03:11.069> skeleton<00:03:11.549> let's<00:03:12.150> now<00:03:12.360> move<00:03:12.599> on

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
entire axial skeleton let's now move on

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.020 
entire axial skeleton let's now move on
to<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.290> appendicular<00:03:13.650> skeleton<00:03:14.400> by<00:03:14.730> first

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
to the appendicular skeleton by first

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.160 
to the appendicular skeleton by first
talking<00:03:15.299> about<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:16.140> pectoral<00:03:16.769> girdle<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:18.170> you

about the pelvic girdle the first part
of<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.670> pelvic<00:03:53.000> girdle<00:03:53.030> we'll<00:03:53.569> look<00:03:53.780> at<00:03:54.019> is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
of the pelvic girdle we'll look at is

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.100 
of the pelvic girdle we'll look at is
the<00:03:54.709> coxa<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.060> divided<00:03:56.569> into<00:03:56.720> three

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
the coxa this is divided into three

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.670 
the coxa this is divided into three
parts<00:03:57.409> the<00:03:57.799> ilium<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.939> pubis<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.989> the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
parts the ilium the pubis and the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.759 
parts the ilium the pubis and the
ischium<00:04:01.689> you<00:04:02.689> must<00:04:02.959> remember<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.439> there<00:04:03.709> are

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
ischium you must remember that there are

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.339 
ischium you must remember that there are
two<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.459> each<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.970> these<00:04:05.060> bones<00:04:05.390> on<00:04:05.780> both<00:04:06.019> sides

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
two of each of these bones on both sides

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.470 
two of each of these bones on both sides
of<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.620> pelvic<00:04:07.010> girdle<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.609> bone<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.420> the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
of the pelvic girdle the bone in the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.539 
of the pelvic girdle the bone in the
middle<00:04:08.569> of<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.079> coxa<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.829> sacrum<00:04:10.370> which

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
middle of the coxa is the sacrum which

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.369 
middle of the coxa is the sacrum which
we<00:04:10.970> have<00:04:11.090> already<00:04:11.269> discussed<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:11.989> in<00:04:12.319> the

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
we have already discussed about in the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.559 
we have already discussed about in the
last<00:04:12.560> episode<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:13.609> bone<00:04:13.819> in<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.150> middle<00:04:14.420> of

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
last episode the bone in the middle of

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.750 
last episode the bone in the middle of
the<00:04:14.659> ischium<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.379> called<00:04:15.859> symphysis<00:04:16.430> pubis

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
the ischium is called symphysis pubis

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.969 
the ischium is called symphysis pubis
you<00:04:19.760> might<00:04:19.940> be<00:04:20.090> asking<00:04:20.359> yourself<00:04:20.590> why<00:04:21.590> is<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
you might be asking yourself why is the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.279 
you might be asking yourself why is the
coxa<00:04:22.310> divided<00:04:22.699> into<00:04:22.910> three<00:04:23.120> parts<00:04:23.289> that's

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
coxa divided into three parts that's

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.070 
coxa divided into three parts that's
because<00:04:24.650> when<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.370> are<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.550> child<00:04:25.880> those<00:04:26.630> bones

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
because when you are a child those bones

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.250 
because when you are a child those bones
were<00:04:27.320> connected<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.310> cartilage<00:04:29.300> as<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:30.080> grew

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
were connected to cartilage as you grew

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.890 
were connected to cartilage as you grew
older<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:31.130> cartilage<00:04:31.639> became<00:04:32.120> hard<00:04:32.479> bone

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
older that cartilage became hard bone

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.939 
older that cartilage became hard bone
tissue<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:35.150> must<00:04:35.360> also<00:04:35.599> remember<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:36.199> a

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
tissue we must also remember that a

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.570 
tissue we must also remember that a
female<00:04:37.370> pelvic<00:04:38.150> girdle<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:38.750> bigger<00:04:39.530> than<00:04:40.280> a

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
female pelvic girdle is bigger than a

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.330 
female pelvic girdle is bigger than a
male<00:04:40.849> pelvic<00:04:41.419> girdle<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:42.259> is<00:04:42.470> due<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:43.160> her

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
male pelvic girdle this is due to her

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.600 
male pelvic girdle this is due to her
giving<00:04:43.729> bursts<00:04:44.889> well<00:04:45.889> it<00:04:46.160> looks<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.400> we're

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
giving bursts well it looks like we're

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.890 
giving bursts well it looks like we're
finished<00:04:46.759> with<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.060> pelvic<00:04:47.449> girdle

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
finished with a pelvic girdle

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.350 
finished with a pelvic girdle
and<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.560> looks<00:04:48.770> like<00:04:49.010> we're<00:04:49.610> ready<00:04:49.849> for<00:04:49.910> a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
and it looks like we're ready for a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:59.800 
and it looks like we're ready for a
quick<00:04:50.930> review<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:59.120> have<00:04:59.150> three<00:04:59.599> different

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
quick review you have three different

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.279
