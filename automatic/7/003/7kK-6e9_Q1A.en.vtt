00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
anymore anyway would have already been

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.840 
anymore anyway would have already been
lined<00:04:06.310> up<00:04:08.160> whether<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.579> would<00:04:09.700> have<00:04:09.790> been

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
lined up whether that would have been

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.060 
lined up whether that would have been
these<00:04:10.030> guys<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.450> don't<00:04:10.630> know<00:04:10.810> but<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.680> trend<00:04:11.890> of
