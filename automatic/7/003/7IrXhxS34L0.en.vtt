you<00:06:55.230> think<00:06:55.260> the<00:06:55.800> more<00:06:56.130> time<00:06:56.310> you<00:06:56.430> have<00:06:56.460> to<00:06:56.610> get

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
you think the more time you have to get

yourself into trouble so we bring you
down<00:06:58.950> quick<00:06:59.280> and<00:06:59.550> we<00:06:59.850> bring<00:07:00.060> you<00:07:00.150> down<00:07:00.300> hard<00:07:00.870> so

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
down quick and we bring you down hard so

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.560 
down quick and we bring you down hard so
don't<00:07:01.680> worry<00:07:01.740> about<00:07:02.010> how<00:07:02.250> easily<00:07:02.640> or<00:07:03.120> how<00:07:03.300> hard

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
don't worry about how easily or how hard

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.120 
don't worry about how easily or how hard
you<00:07:03.720> land<00:07:04.020> it's<00:07:04.320> gonna<00:07:04.530> be<00:07:04.680> a<00:07:04.710> tough<00:07:04.950> landing

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
you land it's gonna be a tough landing

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:13.320 
you land it's gonna be a tough landing
anyway<00:07:06.030> okay

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.089 

basically<00:07:14.330> I'm<00:07:14.720> in<00:07:14.930> a<00:07:14.960> shopping<00:07:15.439> cart<00:07:15.770> with<00:07:15.979> an

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
basically I'm in a shopping cart with an

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.040 
basically I'm in a shopping cart with an
engine<00:07:16.400> and<00:07:16.460> a<00:07:16.580> bedsheet<00:07:16.789> I<00:07:17.270> guess<00:07:17.900> this

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
engine and a bedsheet I guess this

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.159 
engine and a bedsheet I guess this
proves<00:07:18.229> anyone<00:07:18.680> can<00:07:18.800> fly<00:07:19.689> none<00:07:20.689> of<00:07:20.719> the<00:07:20.930> stunts

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169 
proves anyone can fly none of the stunts

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:22.689 
proves anyone can fly none of the stunts
in<00:07:21.409> the<00:07:21.500> rocketeer<00:07:21.979> could<00:07:22.189> have<00:07:22.310> prepared<00:07:22.430> me

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:22.699 
in the rocketeer could have prepared me

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:25.090 
in the rocketeer could have prepared me
for<00:07:22.819> this
