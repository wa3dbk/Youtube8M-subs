 too much attention from the dogs of 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.970

 empty broken limbs and heads 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.440
 crushed the island of the dolls this 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.379
 landscape was created by a young man named Julian 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.690
 barrier one day when a girl drowned 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.970
 in a barrier channel found in the place 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.979
 of his death to a doll the young 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.900
 he was convinced that the toy was 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.660
 connected with the spirit of the deceased 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.610
 then he found another doll and from 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.280
 then he could not stop and continued 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.220
 for 50 years collecting the toys 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.220
 that there was in the trash number 2 the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.680
 ghost town of sanz and taiwan in the 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.750
 70s on this Chinese island began the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.490
 construction of a city that had to 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.139
 host a holiday resort of 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.199
 futuristic style for tourists 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.139
 wealthy however it soon became 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.610
 obvious that the place was cursed 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.840
 dozens of workers died in the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.990
 strange area 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.940
 and the final apotheosis of the luxurious project 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.910
 it was a typhoon that devastated the area 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.470
 causing severe losses the complex 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.350
 it has become a ghost town 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.270
 very popular among the tourists 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.040
 nearby residents ensure that the 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.550
 city ​​is populated by spirits 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.710
 malignant number 1 the well to give trick or 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.810
 crater of giving trick also known as 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.760
 the door to hell is an ancient 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.650
 prospecting for gas located in the great 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.680
 karakum desert near the small 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.000
 village of giving truce in Turkmenistan the 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.950
 desert that occupies 70% of the country or 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.990
 350,000 kilometers one is very rich in 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.870
 oil and natural gas this huge 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.840
 hole 60 meters in diameter and 20 of 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.880
 depth appeared in 1971 during 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.340
 some gas exploration works of 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.320
 Soviet geologists who saw how 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.690
 his team and his stores were treated 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.850
 for the earth they had actually 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.039
 discovered a full underground cave 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.660
 of natural gas as they proved later 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.880
 to set it on fire 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.639
 since then it burns without pause and gives 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.230
 an overwhelming spectacle has not yet 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.780
 knows when it will turn off 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.490
 but the amount was too much and 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.800
 the type of fluid was difficult to 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.630
 determine it was impossible 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.820
 exploit it they understood that their 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.310
 chemical composition will be poisonous 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.830
 so they decided that it was best to burn 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.470
 the gas which involved the surface 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.400
 fire may last a few days 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.040
 speculated error 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.950
 from that initial spark the hole of 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.570
 fire has not been turned off at night you can 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.700
 see from thousands of kilometers on the 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.190
 darkness and has given him a very little fame 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.270
 useful to the nearby bbc population where 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:36.790
 barely 350 people live in 2010 on 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.820
 president of independent Turkmenistan 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.610
 since the disintegration of the ussr in 1991 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.770
 promised that the well would close but 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.380
 gurbangulí berdimujamédov representative 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.810
 since 2007 after winning the elections 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.390
 without accusations of previous fraud with the 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.460
 vote of 29 percent of the electorate not 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.310
 has fulfilled to locate on the map 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.070
 Turkmenistan serves from Iran to 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.950
 south of the country afghanistan its border 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.160
 southeast uzbekistan east-northeast and 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.870
 kazakhstan to the north the sea to the limit 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.790
 territory in the west but what 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.590
 important is not towards the sides 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.330
 but under this soil so 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.850
 particularly enriched by 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.340
 gas deposits that at least in the 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.070
 case of the infernal hole of bbc seem 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.170
 endless if you liked the video 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.470
 Share it with your friends I would be 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.470
 great help
