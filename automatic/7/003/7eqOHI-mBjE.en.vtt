00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:04.930
 nicely the most common mistakes you will see when learning Tai Chi 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.530
 shape 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.499
 he is that the steps become too narrow 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.749
 So that means people say they give their stated goals 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:14.459
 step 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.459
 and then the step lands 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.000
 that is pretty relaxed and okay until then then people go after 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.989
 ahead 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.899
 just turn one and now you realize how that of me 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.689
 in the light coats foot cream wants to narrow that you have to hear now 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.120
 where to do something 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.780
 or 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.950
 What happens is that people start to twist their knees 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.010
 what are hot we want the weight to be salt 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.230
 BrÃ¼hl step 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 always simple formula to make as wide as long 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.080
 In this way, you now have the option and the restrictive 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.650
 all joints move well similar too narrow then you realize 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.130
 spin and 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.090
 what the no more room in the joints 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 if you have this 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130
 then you can not do it anymore 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.009
 However, if you can not turn anymore, you will not be able to turn it around 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.970
 Worrying deeper made up for their knees 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.750
 that is to say, putting the steps too narrow is such a lot out of itself 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.930
 a whole episode of many other mistakes or 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.050
 around possibilities HTR gives 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.050
 and a special feature is that too 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.040
 Whatever it takes to move pretty hard is great 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.320
 have understood the step right to do that you just other 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.990
 made 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.229
 I do not care anymore which techniques are used by everybody 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:41.880
 to have 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.670
 and finally 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.340
 to get safely into the body feeling 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.830
 it's definitely going to eventually slip so inside 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.840
 let it be felt 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.110
 to put on big topics 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.230
 Bluetooth actually comes into the step so in the end 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.380
 width and length balance 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.909
 the basis for all that is what we then instruct otherwise
