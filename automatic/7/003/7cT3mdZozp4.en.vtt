first<00:00:44.640> step<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.719> sonic<00:00:45.930> scaler

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
first step I'm just using a sonic scaler

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
first step I'm just using a sonic scaler
here<00:00:46.650> to<00:00:46.800> make<00:00:46.980> sure<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:48.060> tooth<00:00:48.240> surface

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
here to make sure that the tooth surface

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.440 
here to make sure that the tooth surface
is<00:00:48.930> nice<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:49.740> clean<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.210> temp

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
is nice and clean as we get the temp

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.020 
is nice and clean as we get the temp
bond<00:00:51.690> temporary<00:00:52.290> cement<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.910> the

bond temporary cement off of here the
temp<00:00:54.239> pod<00:00:54.390> comes<00:00:54.660> off<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:54.870> easily<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
temp pod comes off pretty easily this is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.370 
temp pod comes off pretty easily this is
just<00:00:56.220> something<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.700> do<00:00:56.840> with<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> sonic

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
just something I do with the sonic

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.500 
just something I do with the sonic
scaler<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.399> sure<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.880> I've

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
scaler to kind of make sure that I've

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
scaler to kind of make sure that I've
got<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.930> preparation<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.860> clean<00:01:02.280> as

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
got that preparation as clean as

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
got that preparation as clean as
possible<00:01:02.480> after<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.630> temps<00:01:03.960> been<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.259> for<00:01:04.470> a

possible after that temps been on for a
couple<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.979> weeks<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.299> after<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:06.990> take<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
couple of weeks and so after we take the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
couple of weeks and so after we take the
crown<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.770> try<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.210> patient

crown and try it in and the patient

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
crown and try it in and the patient
looks<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.229> gets<00:01:10.409> their<00:01:10.619> approval<00:01:11.250> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
looks at it and gets their approval this

looks at it and gets their approval this
happens<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> solid<00:01:12.329> zirconia<00:01:12.810> crown

happens to be a solid zirconia crown

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.780 
happens to be a solid zirconia crown
because<00:01:13.829> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> possibility<00:01:14.759> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
because of the possibility of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
because of the possibility of
contamination<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.110> phosphate<00:01:16.829> groups

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880 
contamination from the phosphate groups
in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> saliva<00:01:17.750> we're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
in the saliva we're going to use a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.640 
in the saliva we're going to use a
zirconia<00:01:20.549> oxide<00:01:21.180> solution<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.260> put<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.560> on

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
zirconia oxide solution and put that on

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
zirconia oxide solution and put that on
the<00:01:22.740> inside<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.370> crown<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.940> 20<00:01:24.240> seconds

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the inside of this crown for 20 seconds

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.090 
the inside of this crown for 20 seconds
and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.440> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.590> rinse<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.950> out

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and then we're going to rinse that out

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.820 
and then we're going to rinse that out
because<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> liquid<00:01:27.090> zirconia<00:01:27.720> oxide<00:01:28.260> any

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
because it's a liquid zirconia oxide any

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.469 
because it's a liquid zirconia oxide any
of<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.100> phosphate<00:01:29.520> groups<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> saliva

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
of the phosphate groups from the saliva

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
of the phosphate groups from the saliva
that<00:01:30.750> were<00:01:30.840> bound<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.440> zirconia<00:01:31.950> crown

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that were bound to the zirconia crown

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.990 
that were bound to the zirconia crown
are<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.380> bound<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.070> purple

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
are now going to be bound to the purple

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.219 
are now going to be bound to the purple
liquid<00:01:36.119> we're<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> rinse<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.080> out

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
liquid we're going to rinse it right out

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
liquid we're going to rinse it right out
of<00:01:37.260> there<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.680> now<00:01:38.010> we're<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
of there and now we're going to put a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
of there and now we're going to put a
zircon<00:01:39.600> EO<00:01:39.930> primer<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.979> inside<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
zircon EO primer on the inside of this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700 
zircon EO primer on the inside of this
crown<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.240> we've<00:01:42.390> placed<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.080> zirconia

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
crown so we've placed the zirconia

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.840 
crown so we've placed the zirconia
primer<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.189> they're<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.400> to<00:01:44.460> hit<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.760> with

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
primer and they're going to hit it with

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
primer and they're going to hit it with
some<00:01:45.030> air<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> help<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
some air and that's going to help the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.929 
some air and that's going to help the
resin<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.760> our<00:01:47.850> nexus<00:01:48.299> r<00:01:48.540> MGI<00:01:49.310> bond<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
resin in our nexus r MGI bond to the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.310 
resin in our nexus r MGI bond to the
crown<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> bleed<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> little

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
crown so we're going to bleed a little

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.140 
crown so we're going to bleed a little
bit<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.650> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.890> tip<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.490> an<00:01:53.640> auto<00:01:53.850> mix

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
bit out of the tip it's an auto mix

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.080 
bit out of the tip it's an auto mix
system<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.680> result<00:01:56.010> it<00:01:56.640> doesn't<00:01:56.970> get

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
system and so as a result it doesn't get

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.350 
system and so as a result it doesn't get
much<00:01:57.240> easier<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.470> mix<00:01:58.740> cement<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.119> just

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
much easier to to mix cement and I just

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
much easier to to mix cement and I just
put<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.810> dot<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> end<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
put one little dot from the end of it on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
put one little dot from the end of it on
my<00:02:02.520> glove<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.150> then<00:02:03.479> we're<00:02:03.720> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> fill

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
my glove and then we're going to fill

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.890 
my glove and then we're going to fill
the<00:02:04.530> crown<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.100> let<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.909> auto<00:02:06.119> makes<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.659> room

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
the crown and let that auto makes a room

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.630 
the crown and let that auto makes a room
reminds<00:02:07.409> me<00:02:07.530> how<00:02:07.619> nice<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.159> to<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
reminds me how nice it is not to have to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.960 
reminds me how nice it is not to have to
mix<00:02:08.849> things<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.929> hand<00:02:10.349> anymore<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:11.519> you're<00:02:11.760> old

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
mix things by hand anymore if you're old

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.460 
mix things by hand anymore if you're old
enough<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.239> me<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.659> remember<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.079> days<00:02:13.290> of

like<00:02:57.090> wow<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.630> was<00:02:57.990> not<00:02:58.350> only<00:02:58.500> did<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.800> get<00:02:58.860> all

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
like wow that was not only did I get all

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.310 
like wow that was not only did I get all
the<00:02:59.400> cement<00:02:59.640> off<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.420> was<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.780> was<00:03:00.810> simple

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
the cement off but it was it was simple

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.650 
the cement off but it was it was simple
and<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.620> was<00:03:01.710> straightforward<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:03.480> was

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and it was straightforward and it was

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.840 
and it was straightforward and it was
not<00:03:03.870> difficult<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.860> get<00:03:04.980> often<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.790> you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
not difficult to get often and so you

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.180 
not difficult to get often and so you
could<00:03:06.120> wait<00:03:06.330> for<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.840> without<00:03:07.710> doing<00:03:08.070> any

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
could wait for this without doing any

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.400 
could wait for this without doing any
light<00:03:08.430> curing<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.060> doesn't<00:03:09.450> take<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> real

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
light curing and it doesn't take a real

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.930 
light curing and it doesn't take a real
long<00:03:10.650> period<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> time<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.820> we

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
long period of time but you can see we

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330 
long period of time but you can see we
put<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.300> crown<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.830> cured<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.190> for

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
put that crown in and I cured it for

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.740 
put that crown in and I cured it for
about<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.520> second<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.120> checked<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
about a second and I checked it and it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.280 
about a second and I checked it and it
was<00:03:15.870> still<00:03:16.020> just<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:17.000> little<00:03:18.000> bit<00:03:18.210> soft<00:03:19.020> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
was still just a little bit soft and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.660 
was still just a little bit soft and
then<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> hit<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.740> one<00:03:19.890> more<00:03:20.070> time<00:03:20.280> for<00:03:20.520> about

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
then I hit it one more time for about

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.190 
then I hit it one more time for about
another<00:03:20.760> second<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.420> we're<00:03:21.660> cleaning<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.050> up

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
another second so we're cleaning it up

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.560 
another second so we're cleaning it up
immediately<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.460> with<00:03:23.610> most<00:03:23.850> resin-modified

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
immediately and with most resin-modified

immediately and with most resin-modified
glass<00:03:24.660> ionomer<00:03:25.410> cements<00:03:26.130> you're<00:03:26.790> putting<00:03:27.090> the

glass ionomer cements you're putting the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.820 
glass ionomer cements you're putting the

of picking up all those extra pieces of

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.030 
of picking up all those extra pieces of
cement<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.360> approximately<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.230> we<00:03:52.380> find<00:03:52.709> and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
cement in approximately that we find and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.610 
cement in approximately that we find and
then<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.370> polishing<00:03:54.330> tip<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.780> go<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.530> just

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
then a polishing tip to go in and just

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.320 
then a polishing tip to go in and just
smooth<00:03:56.070> off<00:03:56.250> anything<00:03:56.520> any<00:03:56.850> little<00:03:57.030> pieces

smooth off anything any little pieces

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.940 
smooth off anything any little pieces
that<00:03:57.690> might<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.900> there

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
that might be there

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.980 
that might be there
at<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.459> margin<00:03:59.880> or<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.150> we<00:04:00.300> feel<00:04:00.510> like<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.810> need

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
at the margin or if we feel like we need

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.320 
at the margin or if we feel like we need
to<00:04:01.020> go<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.550> really<00:04:02.760> just<00:04:02.880> put<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> high

shine on that restoration in the
gingival<00:04:05.400> third<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.820> there<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.120> cemented

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
gingival third and there it is cemented

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.400 
gingival third and there it is cemented
into<00:04:06.690> place<00:04:06.959> with<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.100> Nexus<00:04:08.750> RMG<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.260> so

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
into place with the Nexus RMG I and so

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.800 
into place with the Nexus RMG I and so
really<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:11.010> ability<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.670> be<00:04:12.120> able<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.360> peel

that<00:04:13.020> off<00:04:13.080> in<00:04:13.410> one<00:04:13.620> piece<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.520> big<00:04:14.880> advantage

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
that off in one piece is a big advantage

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.720 
that off in one piece is a big advantage
of<00:04:16.020> this<00:04:16.290> material<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.040> course<00:04:17.280> with<00:04:17.520> the
