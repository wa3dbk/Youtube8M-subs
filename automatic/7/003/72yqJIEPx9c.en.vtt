00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.020
 hello how are youtube eaves 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.610
 welcome to a new video I know that 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.320
 many of you have problems with 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.060
 the loading of your devices and that 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.890
 they want it to last a little longer with 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.599
 it seems I bring you york toilet for a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.820
 application that will help us save the 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.369
 load and control the consumption to our 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.720
 let's see the and well then we start 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.820
 with the review of this application that the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.349
 battery doctor the first thing we notice is 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.820
 that on the top in the bar 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.100
 notifications we find a 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.019
 number 33 inside a circle we are going to 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 explain it to see what it is and is a 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.219
 notification of material with which 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.570
 it can not be deleted because it is 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.200
 disputing with its increase is not 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.540
 worry that this resource tells us that 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.610
 we have a 33 percent load 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.520
 and automatically she makes a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.620
 calculation and we come a number estimated 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.090
 what an estimate of how long it will last 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.950
 our charge to enter the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 application let's click on that 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.390
 notification and it will take us directly 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.490
 to the claim to 20 minutes 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.030
 the first thing we noticed on the button 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 optimize let's push them and we 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.909
 perform an application diagnosis 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.380
 that we can mark or mark 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.800
 acronyms we omit if we want them 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.450
 clean let's give it clean now and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.009
 As you can see it has closed us 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 applications of arcs sr more times 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.990
 and now he tells us that 7 hours with 37 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.790
 minutes that is, we won 42 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 minutes of time closing the preferred 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.380
 running in the background we're going to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.880
 return main menu 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.219
 now in the bottom part we 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.250
 we find a menu that says save 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.650
 load radio mode let's go to the mode 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 to load 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.190
 As you can see it shows us the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.990
 percentage of caries that we have and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.110
 We can see the service history of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 load in the lower part shown 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.790
 completely never 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 we have made a normal load in 50 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
 times and an overload that covers it in 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.140
 you are shown when we read about 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.209
 charger and has surpassed limit of 5 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.580
 hundreds all this leads a story in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.020
 this application so that we can 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.680
 bring a new control of our 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.540
 body of charges 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.890
 let's select the mode option 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.689
 it will be indicated to you by the way 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.549
 we want to have we can have it in mode 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.439
 default super silent saving 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.239
 the new custom is the mode 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.829
 personalized I achieved already pressing 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.019
 where there are more options than you 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.969
 they can perfectly create their protection 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.010
 let's see what we can see in 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.200
 it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.780
 Here I discuss controlling the brightness of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.579
 our screen how much the percentages 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.349
 we want to have them as 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.620
 advisable to keep them below 30 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.970
 percent of those who go in 40 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.010
 we have the waiting time on how much 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.709
 time we want to wait for our 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.079
 screen to remain active what 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.510
 preferable is not having before 30 seconds 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.430
 join let's see in 30 seconds if 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.290
 we want to keep the data activated on 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.269
 wifi the mutÃºn the synchronization 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.180
 automatic violation you are going to 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.280
 create one to save for when 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.079
 get a 30 percent load a 15 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.120
 percent to do here from the wifi 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.500
 it turns off the signs in or 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.629
 tomato that you have left are resources that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.180
 they consume enough charge we are going to save 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.760
 the changes and in this case then we 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.709
 let's go what is the range mode 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.500
 in the range mode that shows us that 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.510
 the consumption that each application of 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.689
 battery as you can see I have consumed a 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.040
 I am being consumed 22 percent 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.810
 among other applications that we can see 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.970
 and we can do them automatically myself 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.430
 I'm going to close twitter to see the graph 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.629
 of consumption that has had I will close 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.010
 facebook is running us is the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.939
 catalog for investing he is no longer 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.379
 active and thus we can close and read 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.519
 the consumption that our 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.629
 applications of our battery 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.250
 we go back to what in the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.560
 main option of the cake and dr 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.629
 and here we can deploy down and 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.150
 we can activate or deactivate what they are 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.950
 the data the wifi the brightness and the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.010
 room comes with options with a 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.660
 stick also to hate estimate the volume 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.700
 closed 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.550
 and equipment we have what is saving 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.650
 smart let's push dollar saving 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.500
 smart and shows us a series of 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.030
 options we can manage we can 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.950
 manage the auto start 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.200
 and applications we want them to start 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.300
 at the moment we started our 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.830
 our terminal we also have the 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.500
 low battery notification if we want 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.660
 maintain the activity that you indicate in 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.160
 this case I have when the battery arrived 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.590
 20 percent to show us a 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.910
 message saying that on the battery it 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.760
 find low that you have to connect it in 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.060
 our hunter I also have the mode of 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.689
 low energy is clear that something standing 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.299
 let's activate it 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.489
 and he tells me that it will happen mode 

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:58.669
 Low energy when the energy is at 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:05:00.799
 20% put it when you get to 30 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.799
 one hundred and twenty percent on these milestones 

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:05.959
 I'm going to pay but before I want 

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:08.419
 show them that when we say I 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.279
 I have a 20 percent battery 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.979
 then it will move to the mode of 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.139
 current low battery mode is going to change 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.669
 2 I have to change the mode 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.469
 super saving how to turn off 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.839
 our - took almost analyzed in others 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.489
 we can perfectly create in ones the 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.499
 which only we have activated the 

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:26.419
 data with what we need so 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.830
 when a battery percentage arrives 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.849
 automatically sing to that mode 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.029
 let's go back 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:38.539
 we also have the list ignored and 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:41.330
 applications we want to close or issue to 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.979
 moment that we optimize our 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.249
 terminal with the option to think of 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.529
 beaten and then here we are going to give in more 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.469
 options and tells us on the screen 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.569
 saving off as power I wanted to 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:57.749
 disable wifi and synchronization 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.879
 let's activate it you can help it with 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.399
 honesty I also have here disable 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.309
 wifi when it says that when the signal of 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:06.929
 wifi is less than 10% this what 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.789
 means that if we have to 

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:11.550
 give us pro wifi that we are connected to 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.339
 a wifi network that at the moment that 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.309
 we move away from her and have a 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:19.189
 10% internal connection will deactivate 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:23.039
 our wifi what will help us 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:25.439
 save the energy this is not a 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.930
 quite useful option since in many 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:29.699
 cases we are connected to a network and we 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.499
 we get away from there he forgot to stop 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.229
 our 20 and futures continue 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:35.430
 consuming energy then that option 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.390
 it's quite useful and that in this case 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.580
 usually convert 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.310
 finally let's see what are the 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.560
 lace or widgets as you can see 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.240
 we have windows to activate or 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.580
 disable the data are luÃ­s and the 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.800
 Shine the vibration from our 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.630
 desk we also have another widget 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.600
 that tells us the percentage we have 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.850
 of our load and the estimated time and 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.890
 in the way we find them if 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.970
 they want to have them all in one and not 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:07.420
 have them separately let's add a 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.420
 new widget 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.610
 destiny we deal with doctor basteri 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.450
 selectable we will select the 34 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.070
 be two granddaughters of batteries and how can 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.890
 watch 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.770
 and we already have the two options in a 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.840
 just guild and who prefer to have it 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.210
 separate but if the loua separately 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.249
 but in this case, I prefer to have them 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.799
 both in one 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:38.619
 to be able to reach both 

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:38.619
 and not only all 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.620
 and well you know how to control the load 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.360
 of your device there is another application 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.220
 that I also like a lot that is called 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.930
 the battery seibert is quite similar 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.669
 and can use either of the two 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.139
 here in the description I leave you the 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.880
 links so that the download and how 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:56.130
 I always invite you to like it 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.130
 this video share it and subscribe to 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:02.570
 this channel until the next set 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.770
 well the folders that not only have 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.990
 appear mounted on the disk to 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.300
 create a folder only to strain it 

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.570
 about an application and we mount it on 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.570
 other
