00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
the gamma hats but like a gamma like the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.219 
the gamma hats but like a gamma like the
way<00:05:17.970> does<00:05:18.150> that<00:05:18.330> work<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.900> just<00:05:19.080> get

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
different like more and more difficult

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.000 
different like more and more difficult
as<00:05:20.940> like<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.479> letters<00:05:21.780> go<00:05:22.260> on<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:22.860> like

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
as like the letters go on so like

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.830 
as like the letters go on so like
wouldn't<00:05:23.310> gamma<00:05:23.520> be<00:05:23.760> very<00:05:24.060> very<00:05:24.330> strong<00:05:24.660> I

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840
