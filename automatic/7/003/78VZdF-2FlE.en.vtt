00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 I would say if the announcement then in the night 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.970
 there are guitars with fabrizio consoli 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.690
 even this beautiful strength 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.690
 of love 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.440
 years 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.800
 it was a movie 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.410
 a rebel 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.860
 solar television 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.860
 brings good 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 I was afraid 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.910
 the creature 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.540
 beautiful 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.540
 but the door 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.630
 that rule 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 because the chelsea 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.330
 wait 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.330
 now don't leave 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.910
 no team 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.530
 nobody 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.650
 and now 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 and the desire to 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.590
 I felt like a guitar freak 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.250
 thanks again province the case there 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.310
 I would have clearly heard the voice of 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.310
 eugenio finardi 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.430
 and it came in short, yes owner has thought 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.520
 of course to immediately take one 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.520
 then I said eugenio in the meantime thanks for 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.160
 having reached us and the power of love 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.380
 a truly extraordinary song like 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.450
 how did it seem to you? 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.970
 boys and it's not the first time 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.160
 face up this is what we did 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.690
 even very fun evenings 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.990
 holds very well very faithful 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.010
 to the original if I have a criticism I would have me 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.230
 would have liked to hear one 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.930
 different arrangement also because I have 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.940
 tried to rearrange it so it is 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.710
 impossible is understood wanted a 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.520
 different arrangement but knowing that it is 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.300
 impossible 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.550
 I said that I came to see you 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.910
 precautionary custody 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.490

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.170

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.160
