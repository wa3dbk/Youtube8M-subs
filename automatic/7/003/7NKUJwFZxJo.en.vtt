00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello you, I welcome you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.549
 a new video is believed today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.799
 I go very fast 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.889
 I plan next week once again a 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.660
 Hairdresser's visit the hair is ready 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.580
 relatively strong demand so I would say 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.900
 they have to be cut again 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm not quite sure yet 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.830
 sure in which direction it should go 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.180
 In any case I want them in general 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.380
 let them grow that means they should 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 be schooled again 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 how long i keep trying 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.019
 but first the crucial question 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.790
 now if I from the example 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.350
 thereby ensuring all stages if I so me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 cut a kind of pony there I was like that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.140
 do not have a complete pony cut 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.690
 will continue to already and I have here 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 you can see a bit above 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 but the bonuses and I went so 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.270
 I can not have an important pony 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.160
 apart from that, if I have the glasses 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.149
 I like it a bit 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.870
 funny if you have one 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.460
 visionary curtain just so that 's it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 my consideration or whether I'll stop it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.780
 Just cut a bus so that you can 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 then the normal length so far 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 to maintain so I'm off to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.239
 totally undecided and fans totally 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 nice if you support me there 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 Could be some ideas maybe 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.990
 Do you have the hairstyle suggestions? 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.260
 I'm currently there as I said very much 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.610
 uncertain and the other question would be 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 Of course, I'll be one again 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
 other hair color do that than we do 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 Make it darker right now 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.680
 pretty much my natural color actually 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 are they relatively dark or so mean 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.549
 I need something in winter 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.009
 of course, works quite well but 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.659
 nonetheless so totally natural 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.570
 and I have moments where I am 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.200
 then actually artificial touch 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.729
 marca such an artificial brown im 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.439
 principle that already became brown 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.759
 remain area but the question is whether 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.470
 they are getting a bit darker 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450
 or whether they are brighter or easier 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.250
 stay like that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.759
 and as I said how I cut them 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 should leave 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.439
 So give me tips I am 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.119
 curious and see dania world someday 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.130
 which I did not decide for 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.140
 As I said next week not over 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 at the latest next week I plan 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.340
 a hairdresser visit I wait for you 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.719
 comments before no flying off me 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.250
 say first until then I want me 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.250
 still nice to your franz i
