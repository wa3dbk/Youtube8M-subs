00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 Hello dear friends, we continue 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.080
 study the mechanics of the game and this time I 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.599
 I will explain to you how 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.380
 I'm already attacking how to mine a stone 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.989
 my favorite way without 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.640
 maximum fast speed for this 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:35.160
 we need to put the verses first on 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 a quarry us 1 is enough for 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.520
 example but in principle you can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.520
 please post and how much will fit 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.530
 we enclose the sound of a quarry from all 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 the parties are not basically a stone namely 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.200
 the quarry is now my valiant 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:00.329
 getters will pass fencing 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:04.970
 quarry and put god second points 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.399
 and now we will notice that the worker 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.219
 a quarry worker will not go for 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.439
 stone collecting 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.159
 his sara stones start to appear 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.900
 right here as soon as they are here 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.310
 forces appear teleport here 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.560
 But in general, one of the examples 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.560
 wonderful mechanics of our game with you 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.729
 you can add speed to it and I will give you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.020
 demonstrate that does not happen completely 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.930
 will be especially when there are several 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.930
 Turks appear and fast here 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.600
 everything is very simple because of me but in this we 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.600
 talk in the next part 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.750
 but
