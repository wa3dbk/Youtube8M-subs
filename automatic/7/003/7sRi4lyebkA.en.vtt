00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
charge trying to get it may be a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.750 
charge trying to get it may be a
different<00:01:07.710> voice<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
different voice a little bit of a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
different voice a little bit of a
different<00:01:08.790> direction<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:10.229> hard<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.820> say

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
different direction little hard to say

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.179 
different direction little hard to say
exactly<00:01:12.200> where<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.619> yet<00:01:13.920> i<00:01:13.950> think

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
exactly where that will go yet i think

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.160 
exactly where that will go yet i think
you<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.700> give<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> significantly<00:01:15.900> more

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you have to give it significantly more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.190 
you have to give it significantly more
time<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:16.950> someone<00:01:17.720> not<00:01:18.720> an<00:01:18.810> expert<00:01:19.140> on

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
time and I'm someone not an expert on

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
time and I'm someone not an expert on
everything<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.950> am<00:01:20.009> an<00:01:20.250> expert<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> interim

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
everything but I am an expert on interim

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
everything but I am an expert on interim
coach<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.140> done<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> twice<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.640> really

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
coach have done it twice and it really

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
coach have done it twice and it really
is<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:25.080> least<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.470> month<00:01:25.680> before<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.189> think

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
is a at least a month before I think

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.810 
is a at least a month before I think
anyone<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.360> put<00:01:28.290> any<00:01:28.770> level<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.280> stamp<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
anyone can put any level of a stamp on a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670 
anyone can put any level of a stamp on a
team<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.659> coach<00:01:30.960> nad<00:01:31.200> has<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> be

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
team so I think coach nad has got to be

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
team so I think coach nad has got to be
given<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.189> time<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.970> it'd<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.600> nice<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> have

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
given more time and it'd be nice to have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
given more time and it'd be nice to have
a<00:01:34.740> healthy<00:01:35.159> line<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> course<00:01:35.970> coach<00:01:36.270> dis

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
a healthy line of course coach dis

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.770 
a healthy line of course coach dis
didn't<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> either<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.479> what

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
didn't have that either now I think what

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.670 
didn't have that either now I think what
we've<00:01:39.930> seen<00:01:40.170> happen<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:41.430> month<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.680> you

Kevin return and even though he's not a
hundred<00:01:50.549> percent<00:01:50.700> makes<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.780> big<00:01:51.930> difference

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
hundred percent makes a big difference

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020 
hundred percent makes a big difference
you<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.799> he's<00:01:53.009> another<00:01:53.340> guy<00:01:53.460> who<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.909> score

the<00:02:26.040> same<00:02:26.370> player<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.270> for<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.260> team<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the same player and so for this team to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220 
the same player and so for this team to
kind<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.160> go<00:02:29.310> forward<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.940> voice<00:02:30.720> thought<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
kind of go forward I voice thought the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.710 
kind of go forward I voice thought the
real<00:02:31.500> strength<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.130> team<00:02:32.300> could<00:02:33.300> be<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
real strength of this team could be the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.610 
real strength of this team could be the
so-called<00:02:34.380> wing<00:02:34.800> positions<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.670> at<00:02:36.300> times<00:02:36.620> be

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
so-called wing positions and at times be

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.010 
so-called wing positions and at times be
nice<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.070> see<00:02:38.280> Garcia<00:02:38.880> Martin<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.780> Salman's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
nice to see Garcia Martin and Salman's

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.380 
nice to see Garcia Martin and Salman's
on<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> floor<00:02:40.710> at<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.920> same<00:02:40.980> time<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.790> think

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
on the floor at the same time I think

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.090 
on the floor at the same time I think
you<00:02:42.810> could<00:02:42.960> play<00:02:43.170> with<00:02:43.380> with<00:02:43.710> those<00:02:43.890> three

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
you could play with with those three

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
you could play with with those three
guys<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.660> they'd<00:02:45.840> create<00:02:46.170> some

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
guys and I think they'd create some

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.630 
guys and I think they'd create some
problems<00:02:46.380> defensively<00:02:47.010> as<00:02:47.370> well<00:02:47.400> as

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
problems defensively as well as

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.700 
problems defensively as well as
offensively<00:02:48.240> but<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.020> hasn't<00:02:49.470> been

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.160 
offensively but that just hasn't been
available<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.880> team<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.630> any<00:02:51.750> length<00:02:51.990> of

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
hurt a little lately here but it's been

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.780 
hurt a little lately here but it's been
little<00:03:40.320> up<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.620> down<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.830> think<00:03:41.100> honestly

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
little up and down I think honestly

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.030 
little up and down I think honestly
think<00:03:42.209> Spencer's<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:43.170> better<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.920> know

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
think Spencer's a little better you know

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.580 
think Spencer's a little better you know
as<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> center<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.900> from<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.990> high<00:03:46.140> post<00:03:46.380> or

as a center and from the high post or

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.190 
as a center and from the high post or
low<00:03:46.770> post<00:03:47.070> but<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.060> think<00:03:48.510> he's<00:03:48.660> shown<00:03:48.870> enough

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
low post but I think he's shown enough

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.860 
low post but I think he's shown enough
that<00:03:49.440> yeah<00:03:49.830> he's<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.190> track<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:51.240> very<00:03:51.750> good

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
that yeah he's on track to be very good

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.690 
that yeah he's on track to be very good
player<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.440> he's<00:03:52.590> had<00:03:52.770> some<00:03:52.980> very<00:03:53.340> good<00:03:53.490> games

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
player and he's had some very good games

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.390 
player and he's had some very good games
and<00:03:54.150> he's<00:03:54.240> had<00:03:54.390> some<00:03:54.570> very<00:03:54.690> bad<00:03:54.900> games<00:03:55.260> for<00:03:56.160> him

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
and he's had some very bad games for him

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.580 
and he's had some very bad games for him
but<00:03:56.580> that'll<00:03:57.420> all<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:58.170> know<00:03:58.290> there's<00:03:58.500> no

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
but that'll all you know there's no

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.560 
but that'll all you know there's no
doubt<00:03:58.800> in<00:03:58.890> my<00:03:58.980> mind<00:03:59.220> Spencer<00:03:59.790> will<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.180> really

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
doubt in my mind Spencer will be really

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.330 
doubt in my mind Spencer will be really
good<00:04:00.600> because<00:04:00.780> he's<00:04:01.590> got<00:04:01.770> a<00:04:01.800> lot<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.950> talent

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
good because he's got a lot of talent

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.040 
good because he's got a lot of talent
and<00:04:02.430> he<00:04:02.580> wants<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.940> be<00:04:03.060> really<00:04:03.330> good<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.810> then

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
and he wants to be really good and then

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.140 
and he wants to be really good and then
you<00:04:04.260> know<00:04:04.380> it's<00:04:04.530> kind<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.950> starts<00:04:05.250> there<00:04:05.490> so

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
you know it's kind of starts there so

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.290

you know Bobby Brown as a as a kind of a
limited<00:04:09.480> role<00:04:09.840> player<00:04:10.140> but<00:04:10.380> for<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> most

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
limited role player but for the most

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.729

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
good things very hard to do for a rookie

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.740 
good things very hard to do for a rookie
and<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.530> see<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.060> what<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.390> see<00:04:18.570> and

you kind of want to see a little bit

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.370 
you kind of want to see a little bit
more<00:04:20.160> or<00:04:20.400> at<00:04:20.459> least<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:20.700> think<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:21.030> do<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.479> think

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
more or at least I think I do I think

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.740 
more or at least I think I do I think
the<00:04:22.669> real<00:04:23.669> question<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.300> team<00:04:24.570> going

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
the real question for this team going

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.270 
the real question for this team going
forward<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.350> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
forward is the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.010 
forward is the
the<00:04:26.400> veterans<00:04:26.790> I've<00:04:27.090> got<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.570> got<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.930> do

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
the veterans I've got to have got to do

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.300 
the veterans I've got to have got to do
more<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.560> play<00:04:28.980> better<00:04:29.600> Brad<00:04:30.600> Miller<00:04:31.310> Mikey

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
more and play better Brad Miller Mikey

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.730 
more and play better Brad Miller Mikey
more<00:04:32.670> banal<00:04:33.180> Odrick<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.080> in<00:04:34.590> particular

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
more banal Odrick and in particular

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.700 
more banal Odrick and in particular
Bobby<00:04:35.550> Jackson<00:04:35.910> although<00:04:36.419> Bobby<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:37.410> know<00:04:37.530> it

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
Bobby Jackson although Bobby you know it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.460 
Bobby Jackson although Bobby you know it
really<00:04:37.950> shows<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:39.750> heart<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.139> he<00:04:40.260> has

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
really shows you the heart that he has

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.960 
really shows you the heart that he has
but<00:04:40.770> i<00:04:40.800> think<00:04:41.070> these<00:04:41.190> veterans<00:04:41.610> are<00:04:41.760> capable

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
but i think these veterans are capable

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.760 
but i think these veterans are capable
of<00:04:42.120> playing<00:04:42.419> better<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.990> i<00:04:43.320> think<00:04:43.350> they<00:04:43.650> all

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
of playing better and i think they all

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.159 
of playing better and i think they all
need<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.040> play<00:04:44.280> better<00:04:44.840> consistently<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.080> i

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
need to play better consistently and i

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.650 
need to play better consistently and i
think<00:04:46.410> if<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.590> happens<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:48.180> know<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.450> team

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
think if that happens you know this team

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.310 
think if that happens you know this team
can<00:04:48.840> still<00:04:49.160> put<00:04:50.160> on<00:04:50.540> hopefully<00:04:51.540> january<00:04:52.080> will

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
can still put on hopefully january will

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.500 
can still put on hopefully january will
bring<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.980> lot<00:04:53.310> more<00:04:53.340> positives<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.120> talk<00:04:54.330> about

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
bring a lot more positives to talk about

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.260 
bring a lot more positives to talk about
at<00:04:55.110> least<00:04:55.260> i'm<00:04:56.250> hoping<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.610> because<00:04:56.940> i<00:04:57.030> want<00:04:57.240> to

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
at least i'm hoping so because i want to

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.650 
at least i'm hoping so because i want to
talk<00:04:57.419> about<00:04:57.480> more<00:04:57.810> positives<00:04:58.320> all<00:04:58.500> right<00:04:58.620> so

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
that that's about it for december and

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.030 
that that's about it for december and

because 2008 did not end the way I

because 2008 did not end the way I
wanted<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.770> know<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:08.040> didn't<00:05:08.310> for<00:05:08.460> you
