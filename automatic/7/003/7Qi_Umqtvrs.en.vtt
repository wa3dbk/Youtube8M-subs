00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I did I was happy to find out that both

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.530 
I did I was happy to find out that both
of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.689> bindings<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.830> same<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.540> they

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of the bindings are the same and they

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
are the same as the bind at all so the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
are the same as the bind at all so the
same<00:01:24.240> spacing<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.229> excited

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
they have all these sketches so it's not

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.580 
they have all these sketches so it's not
wasted<00:01:40.409> i'm<00:01:40.770> still<00:01:41.159> i'm<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
but let me change the camera angle so i

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.660 
but let me change the camera angle so i
can<00:01:45.869> flip<00:01:46.049> through<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> pages<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:47.040> lot<00:01:47.310> easier

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
little things that I wanted to do and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.400 
little things that I wanted to do and
then<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> back<00:02:11.580> page

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
then on the back page

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.920 
then on the back page
would<00:02:12.500> add<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.710> piece<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.100> pattern<00:02:13.610> paper

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
would add a piece of pattern paper

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.270 
would add a piece of pattern paper
because<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.960> pages<00:02:15.380> are<00:02:15.470> pretty<00:02:15.710> thin<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.190> a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
because the pages are pretty thin and a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.130 
because the pages are pretty thin and a
lot<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.580> ink<00:02:16.760> went<00:02:17.030> through<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.870> add<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
lot of the ink went through so I add a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140 
lot of the ink went through so I add a
piece<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.500> patterned<00:02:19.010> paper<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.790> some<00:02:20.030> more

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
piece of patterned paper do some more

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
piece of patterned paper do some more
stamping<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.930> then<00:02:21.290> write<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> few<00:02:21.830> little

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980

stamping and then write a few little
notes<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.030> actually<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:24.590> now

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
notes in there and actually this now

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so what I did was on the calendar from

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.730 
so what I did was on the calendar from
from<00:02:48.160> scrapbook<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> cards<00:02:50.090> today<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.740> took

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
from scrapbook and cards today I took

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.190 
from scrapbook and cards today I took
out<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.070> calendar<00:02:52.430> pages<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.140> said

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
out the calendar pages and like I said

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.320 
out the calendar pages and like I said
they<00:02:54.500> matched<00:02:54.830> my<00:02:56.140> mind<00:02:57.140> at<00:02:57.290> all<00:02:57.380> exactly<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.970> I

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
they matched my mind at all exactly so I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330 
they matched my mind at all exactly so I
punched<00:02:59.840> all<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.350> calendar<00:03:00.740> pages<00:03:00.950> with<00:03:01.220> my

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
punched all the calendar pages with my

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.090 
punched all the calendar pages with my
mind<00:03:01.550> at<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.690> cut<00:03:02.990> little<00:03:03.650> slits

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
mind at all and then I cut little slits

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.080 
mind at all and then I cut little slits
in<00:03:04.460> each<00:03:05.390> one<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> cut<00:03:07.340> little<00:03:07.550> slits<00:03:07.820> in

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
in each one and so I cut little slits in

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.850 
in each one and so I cut little slits in
between<00:03:08.840> each<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.580> squares<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.620> put

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
between each of the squares so I can put

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.880 
between each of the squares so I can put
the<00:03:13.040> pages<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.840> binder<00:03:15.050> rings<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.860> are

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
the pages in the binder rings that are

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.350 
the pages in the binder rings that are
already<00:03:16.130> in<00:03:16.310> here<00:03:16.550> or<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.880> binding<00:03:17.240> this

already in here or in the binding this
already<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.750> here<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:18.740> is<00:03:18.770> say<00:03:19.130> January

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640

the one video up right now and but I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.559 
the one video up right now and but I
like<00:05:33.979> that<00:05:34.009> they<00:05:34.279> still<00:05:34.550> have<00:05:34.819> the<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
like that they still have the the

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.600 
like that they still have the the
layouts<00:05:35.930> on<00:05:36.169> here<00:05:36.409> that's<00:05:36.590> neat<00:05:36.889> so<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.490> think

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
layouts on here that's neat so I think

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.450 
layouts on here that's neat so I think
this<00:05:37.879> layout<00:05:38.120> is<00:05:38.270> also<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.500> leftover

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
this layout is also in the leftover

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.089 
this layout is also in the leftover
pages<00:05:40.969> that<00:05:41.270> are<00:05:41.539> in<00:05:42.139> that<00:05:42.199> other<00:05:42.560> calendar

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
pages that are in that other calendar

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.610 
pages that are in that other calendar
and<00:05:43.279> then<00:05:43.879> I<00:05:44.120> put<00:05:44.360> on<00:05:44.449> my<00:05:44.599> crop<00:05:44.930> and<00:05:45.199> I<00:05:45.289> had<00:05:45.469> an

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
and then I put on my crop and I had an
