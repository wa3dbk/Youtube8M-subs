of crap advanced mr. gasket regulator

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.230 
of crap advanced mr. gasket regulator
but<00:01:01.000> yes<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.200> does<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.620> job<00:01:02.829> for<00:01:02.890> now<00:01:03.540> but<00:01:04.540> uh

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
but yes it does the job for now but uh

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.629 
but yes it does the job for now but uh
it<00:01:07.240> runs<00:01:07.420> great<00:01:07.569> now<00:01:10.259> also<00:01:11.259> if<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.979> see<00:01:12.429> right

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:12.639 
it runs great now also if you see right

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.510 
it runs great now also if you see right
here<00:01:12.789> that's<00:01:13.060> baking<00:01:13.719> soda<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.350> found<00:01:15.189> out<00:01:15.460> that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
here that's baking soda I found out that

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.179 
here that's baking soda I found out that
power<00:01:16.240> steering<00:01:16.600> fluid<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:17.189> definitely

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
power steering fluid is definitely

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.260 
power steering fluid is definitely
flammable<00:01:19.139> because<00:01:20.139> as<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.499> can<00:01:20.530> see<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:22.090> not

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
flammable because as you can see or not

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.800 
flammable because as you can see or not
see<00:01:22.799> I've<00:01:23.799> removed<00:01:24.189> my<00:01:24.670> power<00:01:25.329> steering<00:01:25.539> pump

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
see I've removed my power steering pump

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.590 
see I've removed my power steering pump
and<00:01:26.170> kind<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.709> didn't<00:01:27.039> think<00:01:27.609> that<00:01:27.999> whenever<00:01:28.389> I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
and kind of didn't think that whenever I

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.989 
and kind of didn't think that whenever I
turned<00:01:29.520> fluid<00:01:30.520> would<00:01:31.060> go<00:01:31.929> shout<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.319> the

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
turned fluid would go shout of the

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:39.349 
turned fluid would go shout of the
steering<00:01:33.999> box<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:37.060> guess<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.359> could<00:01:37.420> say<00:01:37.689> and

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
steering box I guess you could say and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.870 
steering box I guess you could say and
yeah<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:41.590> any<00:01:41.799> I'm<00:01:42.009> an<00:01:42.100> idiot<00:01:42.219> I<00:01:42.579> should<00:01:42.819> have

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
yeah if any I'm an idiot I should have

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.870 
yeah if any I'm an idiot I should have
thought<00:01:43.029> of<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.209> but<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:45.310> live<00:01:45.549> and<00:01:45.579> learn<00:01:45.819> I

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
thought of that but you live and learn I

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.089 
thought of that but you live and learn I
guess<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.770> uh<00:01:50.459> yeah<00:01:51.459> uh<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:53.590> great<00:01:53.829> now

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
guess but uh yeah uh that's great now

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.199 
guess but uh yeah uh that's great now
and<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.149> turns<00:01:55.359> out<00:01:55.509> I<00:01:55.569> did<00:01:55.869> cut<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.289> Springs<00:01:56.499> a

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
and it turns out I did cut the Springs a

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.230 
and it turns out I did cut the Springs a
perfect<00:01:58.209> amount<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:59.349> sets<00:01:59.709> exactly<00:02:00.700> where<00:02:01.209> I

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
perfect amount it sets exactly where I

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.239 
perfect amount it sets exactly where I
want<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:02.069> it<00:02:03.069> uh<00:02:04.349> it's<00:02:05.349> not<00:02:05.499> on<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.829> ground

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
want it to it uh it's not on the ground

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.490 
want it to it uh it's not on the ground
