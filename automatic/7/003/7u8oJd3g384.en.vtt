I<00:00:24.689> used<00:00:25.790> Teresa<00:00:26.790> Collins<00:00:27.119> Christmas<00:00:27.689> cottage

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
I used Teresa Collins Christmas cottage

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.970 
I used Teresa Collins Christmas cottage
and<00:00:28.399> the<00:00:29.399> smallest<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.750> grand<00:00:31.140> circle

nest<00:00:32.160> abilites<00:00:32.669> dies<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.899> use<00:00:34.079> any

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
nest abilites dies you can use any

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
nest abilites dies you can use any
die-cut<00:00:35.129> die<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.840> any<00:00:37.769> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.879> trace<00:00:39.359> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
die-cut die or any you can just trace it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
die-cut die or any you can just trace it
and<00:00:39.719> cut<00:00:39.929> it<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> doesn't<00:00:40.559> matter<00:00:40.890> what

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and cut it out it doesn't matter what

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.619 
and cut it out it doesn't matter what
size<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.429> is<00:00:41.839> just<00:00:42.839> cut<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.199> in<00:00:43.320> half<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> then

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.000 

take<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.989> half<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> measure<00:00:50.999> -<00:00:51.829> four<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.859> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
take one half and measure - four and a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.610 
take one half and measure - four and a
quarter<00:00:53.249> inches<00:00:53.730> measure<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.780> happens<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
quarter inches measure what happens and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.759 
quarter inches measure what happens and
mark<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
mark it

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.939 
mark it
I've<00:00:58.769> seen<00:00:59.190> different<00:00:59.489> versions<00:01:00.109> of<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.350> but

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I've seen different versions of this but

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.180 
I've seen different versions of this but
I<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:03.690> technique<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.040> not

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
I like this technique because you do not

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.780 
I like this technique because you do not
have<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> pattern<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.460> fold

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
have to have a pattern so then you fold

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.450 
have to have a pattern so then you fold
it<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.119> half<00:01:09.149> like<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:10.470> meet<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.189> end

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it in half like that just meet one end

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
it in half like that just meet one end
with<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> half<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.750> marked<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> can

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
with the half you marked and you can

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.030 
with the half you marked and you can
even<00:01:14.100> either<00:01:14.820> line<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.630> directly<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.649> just

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
even either line it up directly or just

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.639 
even either line it up directly or just
scoot<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.579> over<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.810> so

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
scoot it over just a little bit so

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:20.600 
scoot it over just a little bit so
that's<00:01:19.829> what<00:01:19.979> I'm<00:01:20.100> doing

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
that's what I'm doing

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.389 
that's what I'm doing
just<00:01:20.880> let<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.240> overlap<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.290> little<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.680> then

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
just let it overlap a little bit then

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.859 
just let it overlap a little bit then
you<00:01:23.549> take<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.030> end<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.130> fold<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.340> down<00:01:26.549> to

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
you take this end and fold it down to

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.749 
you take this end and fold it down to
meet<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> score<00:01:28.829> line<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.189> have

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
meet with the score line you just have

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
meet with the score line you just have
it<00:01:30.060> has<00:01:30.210> created<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it has created like that and then you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
it has created like that and then you
flip<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:37.530> over<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:39.469> you<00:01:40.469> fold<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.579> end<00:01:41.880> meet

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
flip it over and you fold this end meet

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.279 
flip it over and you fold this end meet
with<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.469> longer<00:01:43.829> end<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.810> your<00:01:45.810> tree<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
with the longer end and your tree is

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.620 
with the longer end and your tree is
already<00:01:46.500> done<00:01:46.859> then<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
already done then you just have to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.599 
already done then you just have to
decorate<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.859> I<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.909> added<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:52.609> sparkles

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
decorate it I just added some sparkles

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.330 
decorate it I just added some sparkles
from<00:01:55.070> 1<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.250> scrap<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.859> adhered<00:01:58.859> it<00:01:59.009> together

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
from 1 to scrap and adhered it together

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.569 
from 1 to scrap and adhered it together
with<00:01:59.549> some<00:01:59.700> glue<00:01:59.939> dots<00:02:00.829> it's<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.159> quick

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
with some glue dots it's a very quick

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.300 
with some glue dots it's a very quick
and<00:02:02.789> fun<00:02:03.299> Christmas<00:02:04.020> card<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.710> hope<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> try<00:02:05.219> it
