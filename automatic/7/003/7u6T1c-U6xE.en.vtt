00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
fret of the a for two measures and then

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.790 
fret of the a for two measures and then
for<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.430> bridge<00:02:05.320> you're<00:02:06.320> going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.530> be<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
for the bridge you're going to be on the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.650 
for the bridge you're going to be on the
first<00:02:07.070> fret<00:02:07.399> of<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.580> e<00:02:07.670> right<00:02:08.119> for<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> measure

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
first fret of the e right for a measure

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.820 
first fret of the e right for a measure
then<00:02:11.980> you're<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.160> third<00:02:13.459> fret<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.180> a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
then you're on the third fret of the a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.600 
then you're on the third fret of the a
and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.130> you're<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.370> do<00:02:16.489> this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then you're going to do this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.280 
and then you're going to do this
situation<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:19.780> when<00:02:20.780> you're<00:02:20.900> doing<00:02:21.140> there

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
situation here when you're doing there

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.020 
situation here when you're doing there
is<00:02:21.530> you're<00:02:21.860> going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.100> hit<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.250> fifth<00:02:22.730> fret

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
is you're going to hit that fifth fret

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.039 
is you're going to hit that fifth fret
of<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.480> twice<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.820> then<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.120> slide<00:02:26.630> all

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
of the a twice but then you slide all

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.729 
of the a twice but then you slide all
the<00:02:27.080> way<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> 17th<00:02:29.780> fret<00:02:30.079> of

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
the way up it's like the 17th fret of

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.550 
the way up it's like the 17th fret of
the<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:32.019> all<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.140> way<00:02:33.200> down<00:02:33.440> here<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.350> you're

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the a all the way down here and you're

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.310 
the a all the way down here and you're
sliding<00:02:36.980> up<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.370> back<00:02:37.579> so<00:02:37.820> you<00:02:37.880> got

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.340 

just<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> got<00:02:43.950> two<00:02:44.100> hits<00:02:45.350> slide

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
just like that so you got two hits slide

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.700 
just like that so you got two hits slide
up<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.710> back<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:47.280> hit<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:48.710> twice

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
up and back and then hit like twice

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:59.070 
up and back and then hit like twice
three<00:02:50.580> times<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.140> guys<00:02:52.290> I'll<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.620> slow

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.600 

just<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.890> second<00:03:01.280> time<00:03:01.459> you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
just like that and the second time you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.410 
just like that and the second time you
bring<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.879> down<00:03:02.030> you're<00:03:02.360> going<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.540> go<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:04.420> to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
bring it down you're going to go and to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.990 
bring it down you're going to go and to
go<00:03:05.660> back<00:03:05.840> down<00:03:06.080> into<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.440> first<00:03:06.680> fret<00:03:07.129> so<00:03:07.849> if<00:03:07.940> I

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
go back down into the first fret so if I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.970 
go back down into the first fret so if I
do<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.180> all<00:03:08.480> slow

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.350 

so<00:03:21.980> that's<00:03:22.129> how<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.310> get<00:03:22.459> back<00:03:22.610> into<00:03:22.879> it<00:03:23.150> and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
so that's how you get back into it and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.089 
so that's how you get back into it and
the<00:03:23.780> second<00:03:24.110> time<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.290> play<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.590> though<00:03:24.890> you

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
the second time you play it though you

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.220 
the second time you play it though you
don't<00:03:25.250> repeat<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.519> all<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.879> hit<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.239> first

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
don't repeat it all you hit the first

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.050 
don't repeat it all you hit the first
fret<00:03:27.709> of<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> E

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.850 

so<00:03:34.060> you're<00:03:34.210> on<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.390> third<00:03:34.660> fret<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.080> a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.290 

four<00:03:38.860> hits<00:03:39.070> on<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.340> third<00:03:39.490> fret<00:03:39.700> four<00:03:40.000> hits<00:03:40.210> on

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
four hits on the third fret four hits on

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.450 
four hits on the third fret four hits on
the<00:03:40.420> second<00:03:40.810> fret<00:03:41.050> so<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:41.980> kind<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.220> split<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
the second fret so you kind of split the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.810 
the second fret so you kind of split the
measure

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.040 

we're<00:03:47.820> now<00:03:47.910> third<00:03:48.150> fret<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> second<00:03:48.900> fret

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
we're now third fret to the second fret

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.570 
we're now third fret to the second fret
of<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:49.980> you're<00:03:50.070> gonna<00:03:50.160> slide<00:03:50.550> up

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
of the a and then you're gonna slide up

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.390 
of the a and then you're gonna slide up
to<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.910> 7th<00:03:51.450> fret<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.310> you

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
to the 7th fret just like that so you

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.330 
to the 7th fret just like that so you
got<00:03:57.500> got<00:03:58.500> kind<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.680> triplets<00:03:59.040> here<00:03:59.250> you're

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
got got kind of triplets here you're

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.900 
got got kind of triplets here you're
gonna<00:03:59.460> hit<00:03:59.610> it<00:04:00.350> three<00:04:01.350> times<00:04:01.670> three<00:04:02.670> times

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910

three more times and they're going to

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.940 
three more times and they're going to
hit<00:04:05.520> twice<00:04:06.020> then<00:04:07.020> you're<00:04:07.140> going<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.290> open<00:04:07.590> E

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
hit twice then you're going to open E

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.810 
hit twice then you're going to open E
