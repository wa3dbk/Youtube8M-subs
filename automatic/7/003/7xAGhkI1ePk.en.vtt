00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060 

in<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:05.230> video<00:00:05.500> we're<00:00:05.620> going<00:00:05.710> to<00:00:05.770> look<00:00:05.859> at<00:00:05.950> how

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.070 
in this video we're going to look at how

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.860 
in this video we're going to look at how
to<00:00:06.130> convert<00:00:06.340> between<00:00:06.820> metric<00:00:07.390> units<00:00:07.720> for

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
to convert between metric units for

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.680 
to convert between metric units for
volume<00:00:08.050> so<00:00:08.860> here<00:00:09.040> I've<00:00:09.130> drawn<00:00:09.370> two<00:00:09.519> cubes<00:00:10.030> one

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
volume so here I've drawn two cubes one

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.440 
volume so here I've drawn two cubes one
from<00:00:10.929> with<00:00:11.110> side<00:00:11.320> length<00:00:11.650> 1<00:00:11.950> meter<00:00:12.490> and<00:00:12.759> the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
from with side length 1 meter and the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.239 
from with side length 1 meter and the
wrong<00:00:13.629> with<00:00:13.869> side<00:00:14.079> by<00:00:14.110> 400<00:00:14.650> centimeters<00:00:15.099> now

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:15.249 
wrong with side by 400 centimeters now

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.100 
wrong with side by 400 centimeters now
let's<00:00:15.369> see<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:15.639> same<00:00:16.150> because<00:00:16.420> one<00:00:16.600> meter<00:00:16.810> is

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
let's see the same because one meter is

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.320 
let's see the same because one meter is
100<00:00:17.470> centimeters<00:00:17.830> what<00:00:18.699> I'm<00:00:18.820> gonna<00:00:19.000> do<00:00:19.150> now<00:00:19.269> is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
100 centimeters what I'm gonna do now is

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.669 
100 centimeters what I'm gonna do now is
just<00:00:19.480> work<00:00:19.689> at<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.869> volume<00:00:20.109> for<00:00:20.289> each<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.590> them

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:20.679 
just work at the volume for each of them

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.130 
just work at the volume for each of them
so<00:00:21.250> if<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.699> width<00:00:21.880> of<00:00:22.000> this<00:00:22.240> one<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.720> 1<00:00:22.929> meter

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
so if the width of this one is 1 meter

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.650 
so if the width of this one is 1 meter
then<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.859> height<00:00:24.039> of<00:00:24.189> it<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.429> 1<00:00:24.640> meter<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:25.119> the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
then the height of it is 1 meter and the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.079 
then the height of it is 1 meter and the
depth<00:00:26.349> of<00:00:26.439> it<00:00:26.589> is<00:00:26.710> 1<00:00:26.859> meter<00:00:27.009> so<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.820> volume

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
depth of it is 1 meter so the volume

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.150 
depth of it is 1 meter so the volume
would<00:00:28.210> be<00:00:28.269> 1<00:00:28.539> meter<00:00:28.660> 1<00:00:29.289> meter<00:00:29.349> times<00:00:29.800> 1<00:00:30.039> meter

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
would be 1 meter 1 meter times 1 meter

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.190 
would be 1 meter 1 meter times 1 meter
which<00:00:30.609> would<00:00:30.730> be<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:31.060> volume<00:00:31.240> would<00:00:31.749> be<00:00:31.810> 1

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
which would be the volume would be 1

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.880 
which would be the volume would be 1
meter<00:00:32.680> cubed<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:33.880> this<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.210> 1<00:00:34.390> meter<00:00:34.630> cube<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
meter cubed so this is 1 meter cube this

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.010 
meter cubed so this is 1 meter cube this
value<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:36.880> cube<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.330> volume<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.690> it's<00:00:37.870> going

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
value this cube the volume of it's going

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.510 
value this cube the volume of it's going
to<00:00:38.110> be<00:00:38.200> well<00:00:38.500> it's<00:00:38.800> going<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:38.980> be<00:00:39.070> 100

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
to be well it's going to be 100

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.210 
to be well it's going to be 100
centimeters<00:00:40.030> by<00:00:40.570> 100<00:00:41.050> centimeters<00:00:41.500> by<00:00:41.680> 100

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
centimeters by 100 centimeters by 100

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.430 
centimeters by 100 centimeters by 100
centimeters<00:00:42.630> when<00:00:43.630> I<00:00:43.660> times<00:00:43.990> those<00:00:44.200> together

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
centimeters when I times those together

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.470 
centimeters when I times those together
100<00:00:45.370> times<00:00:45.790> 100<00:00:46.470> times<00:00:47.470> 100<00:00:48.240> we're<00:00:49.240> gonna<00:00:49.360> get

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
100 times 100 times 100 we're gonna get

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.450 
100 times 100 times 100 we're gonna get
one<00:00:49.870> followed<00:00:50.470> by<00:00:50.500> six<00:00:50.680> zeros<00:00:51.130> 1<00:00:51.670> 2<00:00:52.030> 3<00:00:52.450> 4<00:00:52.990> 5<00:00:53.380> 6<00:00:53.800> so

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
one followed by six zeros 1 2 3 4 5 6 so

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.950 
one followed by six zeros 1 2 3 4 5 6 so
the<00:00:54.610> volume<00:00:54.880> for<00:00:55.030> this<00:00:55.120> home<00:00:55.300> is<00:00:55.540> going<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.840> be

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the volume for this home is going to be

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.790 
the volume for this home is going to be
1<00:00:56.200> million<00:00:59.880> centimeters<00:01:00.880> cubed<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:02.560> means

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
1 million centimeters cubed that means

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.679 
1 million centimeters cubed that means
that<00:01:03.100> one<00:01:03.280> meter<00:01:03.490> cubed<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.330> same<00:01:04.540> as

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
that one meter cubed is the same as

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.190 
that one meter cubed is the same as
volume<00:01:05.199> billion<00:01:05.530> centimeters<00:01:06.220> cubed<00:01:07.200> let's

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
volume billion centimeters cubed let's

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.830 
volume billion centimeters cubed let's
just<00:01:08.380> check<00:01:08.530> with<00:01:08.770> another<00:01:09.100> key<00:01:09.280> ice<00:01:09.690> cubes<00:01:10.690> so

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
just check with another key ice cubes so

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.150 
just check with another key ice cubes so
here<00:01:10.990> we've<00:01:11.110> got<00:01:11.290> two<00:01:11.530> meters<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:11.980> it's<00:01:12.070> going

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
here we've got two meters but it's going

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.940 
here we've got two meters but it's going
to<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.310> 2<00:01:12.490> meters<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:12.940> 2<00:01:13.360> meters<00:01:13.740> times<00:01:14.740> them

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
to be 2 meters and 2 meters times them

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.340 
to be 2 meters and 2 meters times them
together<00:01:15.250> will<00:01:15.460> be<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:15.820> meters<00:01:16.780> cubed

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
together will be it meters cubed

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.770 
together will be it meters cubed
remember<00:01:17.710> 2<00:01:17.980> times<00:01:18.340> 2<00:01:18.580> is<00:01:18.610> 4<00:01:19.060> times<00:01:19.090> 2<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.630> 8

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
remember 2 times 2 is 4 times 2 is 8

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
remember 2 times 2 is 4 times 2 is 8
meters<00:01:20.650> cubed<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.460> one<00:01:21.700> will<00:01:21.850> be<00:01:21.970> 200<00:01:22.540> times

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
meters cubed this one will be 200 times

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.250 
meters cubed this one will be 200 times
200<00:01:23.800> times<00:01:23.950> 200<00:01:24.880> that's<00:01:25.450> going<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.720> be<00:01:25.780> 2<00:01:25.990> times

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
200 times 200 that's going to be 2 times

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.110 
200 times 200 that's going to be 2 times
2<00:01:26.350> times<00:01:26.440> 2<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:27.100> followed<00:01:27.670> by<00:01:27.760> six<00:01:28.030> zeros

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
2 times 2 it followed by six zeros

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.640 
2 times 2 it followed by six zeros
there's<00:01:28.870> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.050> be<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.350> million

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
there's going to be it million

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.469 
there's going to be it million
centimeters<00:01:32.650> cubed<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.760> again<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.180> will<00:01:34.300> see

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
centimeters cubed so again you will see

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.600 
centimeters cubed so again you will see
that<00:01:34.600> conversion<00:01:35.260> rate<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.620> one<00:01:35.920> meter<00:01:36.159> cubed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
that conversion rate of one meter cubed

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.990 
that conversion rate of one meter cubed
is<00:01:36.820> 1<00:01:37.300> million<00:01:37.600> centimeters<00:01:38.440> cubed<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.790> that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
is 1 million centimeters cubed so that's

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.110 
is 1 million centimeters cubed so that's
the<00:01:40.180> conversion<00:01:40.659> rate<00:01:40.810> 1<00:01:41.440> meter<00:01:42.370> cubed<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.850> 1

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
the conversion rate 1 meter cubed is 1

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.840 
the conversion rate 1 meter cubed is 1
million<00:01:44.050> centimeters<00:01:44.590> cubed<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.370> let's<00:01:45.549> do<00:01:45.670> to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
million centimeters cubed so let's do to

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.880 
million centimeters cubed so let's do to
your<00:01:45.940> questions<00:01:46.360> convert<00:01:46.840> 5<00:01:47.110> meters<00:01:47.530> cubed

to go from meters into say I acute into

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.149 
to go from meters into say I acute into
centimeters<00:01:53.140> cubed<00:01:53.409> we're<00:01:53.950> going<00:01:54.100> to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
centimeters cubed we're going to

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.190 
centimeters cubed we're going to
multiply<00:01:54.670> by<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.180> million<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.960> we're<00:01:56.049> going<00:01:56.140> to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
multiply by a million so we're going to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.170 
multiply by a million so we're going to
times<00:01:56.380> 5<00:01:56.620> by<00:01:56.950> million<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:57.490> it's<00:01:57.610> going<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.790> be<00:01:57.880> 5

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
times 5 by million so it's going to be 5

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.050 
times 5 by million so it's going to be 5
million<00:02:00.630> centimeters<00:02:01.650> cubed<00:02:02.820> okay

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
million centimeters cubed okay

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.820 
million centimeters cubed okay
and<00:02:04.240> instead<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:04.990> 1<00:02:05.200> convert<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:07.830> 2,400,000

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
and instead of 1 convert to 2,400,000

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.129 
and instead of 1 convert to 2,400,000
centimeters<00:02:09.310> cubed<00:02:09.610> into<00:02:09.819> meters<00:02:10.269> cubed<00:02:10.569> well

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.139 
centimeters cubed into meters cubed well

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.000 
centimeters cubed into meters cubed well
here<00:02:11.469> you<00:02:11.590> only<00:02:11.709> go<00:02:11.859> from<00:02:11.980> centimeters<00:02:12.459> cubed

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
here you only go from centimeters cubed

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.410 
here you only go from centimeters cubed
intermedia<00:02:13.489> scripts<00:02:13.730> we're<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> divide

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
intermedia scripts we're going to divide

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.300 
intermedia scripts we're going to divide
by<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.720> million<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.560> dividing<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.069> value

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
by a million so dividing this value

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030 
by a million so dividing this value
million<00:02:16.580> will<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.849> two<00:02:17.299> point<00:02:17.810> four<00:02:18.200> meters

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
million will be two point four meters

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.979 
million will be two point four meters
cubed<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:20.510> that's<00:02:20.540> it

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
cubed so that's it

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.509 
cubed so that's it
so<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> mythic<00:02:21.560> remember<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.129> one<00:02:22.310> meter

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
so the mythic remember is that one meter

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.089 
so the mythic remember is that one meter
cubed<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.180> 1<00:02:23.569> million<00:02:23.840> centimeters<00:02:24.560> cubed

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
cubed is 1 million centimeters cubed

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.610 
cubed is 1 million centimeters cubed
there<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:25.730> common<00:02:26.180> mistake<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.110> exam<00:02:27.379> as

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
there was common mistake in the exam as

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.949 
there was common mistake in the exam as
people<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.489> 1<00:02:28.670> meter<00:02:28.819> cube<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.330> 100

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
people think the 1 meter cube is 100

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.600 
people think the 1 meter cube is 100
centimeters<00:02:30.500> cubed<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.190> obviously<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.549> not

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
centimeters cubed but obviously it's not

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.550 
centimeters cubed but obviously it's not
going<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:31.910> be<00:02:31.970> true<00:02:32.209> because<00:02:32.480> each<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
going to be true because each of the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.440 
going to be true because each of the
lengths<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.250> going<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:34.879> into<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> numbers

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
lengths is going to be into the numbers

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.660 
lengths is going to be into the numbers
as<00:02:35.569> times<00:02:35.810> about<00:02:35.989> 100<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.160> what<00:02:37.280> every<00:02:37.430> times

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
as times about 100 so what every times

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.309 
as times about 100 so what every times
those<00:02:37.849> three<00:02:38.090> lengths<00:02:38.420> together<00:02:38.599> it's<00:02:39.079> going

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
those three lengths together it's going

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.930 
those three lengths together it's going
to<00:02:39.470> make<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.739> 1<00:02:39.920> million<00:02:40.220> times<00:02:40.370> bigger

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
to make it 1 million times bigger

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.089 
to make it 1 million times bigger
so<00:02:41.540> what<00:02:41.780> Miller<00:02:41.989> cubed<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.470> 1<00:02:42.860> million

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
so what Miller cubed is 1 million

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.909 
so what Miller cubed is 1 million
centimeter<00:02:43.579> scoops
