00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.100
 start by cutting the eggplant 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.160
 first cut it horizontally 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.960

 you will thus have a kind of great gifts 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.850
 then place a pan on the stove 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.830
 let it warm with oil and when 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.460
 tactical in the eggplant you have 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:15.010

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.010

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.720
 when you will be in matches in this 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.720
 so you see 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:51.240
 clean and the oil and then add it 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.680
 let it fry for no more than 60 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.680
 second I recommend 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.980
 then add the hill tomatoes 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.790
 that have the characteristic of being 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:10.830
 small and round crushed of some 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.040
 of him entirely with half a glass of 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.040
 water 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.489
 cook this sauce for one 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.069
 thirty minutes on moderate heat ed 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.950
 here after 30 minutes the sauce will be 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.409
 ready if you like or to vary the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.860
 recipe you can fry together 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.510
 with smoked pancetta aubergines 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.049
 this point first add the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.650
 mozzarella then the pasta previously 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.030
 cooked and drained I recommend that you al 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.650
 tooth 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.629
 in particular it must be removed from 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.849
 fire two minutes ahead of time 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.000
 recommended by the manufacturer because he must 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.859
 finish cooking in this sauce but 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.250
 to learn more about cooking 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.560
 pasta look at my lesson number two 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.790
 leave it on the fire for a couple 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.150
 of approximately minutes 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.390
 so that the mozzarella begins 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.390
 to melt 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.300
 after which you begin to turn 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.720
 then add the cheese 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.819
 grated and continue turning until 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.319
 when the mozzarella will not be 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.319
 completely dissolved 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.390
 and this is the end result now 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.560
 you can serve and serve 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.430
 adding a final sprinkling of 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.430
 grated cheese
