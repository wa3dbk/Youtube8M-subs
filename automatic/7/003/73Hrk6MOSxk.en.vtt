00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 good and here we are with our beloved 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.610
 be good morning hermes like this I 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.869
 happy because I finish the butt of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.749
 pant we are going to finish the mold 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.849
 full of lady's trousers 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.349
 and start to see a little bit of the flaws that 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.810
 they make the pants as solved 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.759
 farm was barbarous we heard you 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 because no pants when I 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.439
 we cut or at least cut a 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.089
 trousers to the base they may have 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 adapt it for different types of 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.420
 body but the same a woman of tail 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.100
 flat some woman who has with the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.350
 stop if there is belly if not the belly 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.380
 we have to like that first 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 short the base I always say that the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.130
 trouser correction achieve a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.450
 perfect pants is achieved after 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.340
 have cut at least three 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.220
 pants because sometimes when 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 we cut the shots of the pants if 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.780
 we are wrong and we cut it wrong it is very 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.800
 difficult in that same channel or in power 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.540
 correct it 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.480
 then surely we will correct 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.780
 in the next pants but he was wearing a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.339
 small detail that was the shot between 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 hind legs because we had 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.490
 done the forward they remember the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 forward had 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.790
 a stake shot drawn with blue that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.960
 It was 15% in the fourth head say 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.550
 that's why if we had 25 to it was 375 and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.050
 I had already told them 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:29.710
 that the butt was twice as much bone 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.560
 375 twice more this would be seven 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.320
 centimeters and a half look how we are going to 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.480
 do I'm going to mark and I'm going to draw 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 like a wall and I'm going to do it in 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.800
 dotted lines not to be confused 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.540
 that if I know that the shot of the ass 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.240
 has to hit that wall and it's 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.800
 but attention will not reach the same 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.800
 height because if not when I want 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.330
 sew this seam of the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.910
 crotch not true the structure 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.350
 internal of the leg the butt and 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.890
 front has to have the same 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.110
 measure to be exactly the same and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.400
 so what we are going to do 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.460
 measure the leg here below doing 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.070
 and here it turns knee 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.980
 they come exactly the same in the 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.110
 drawings of the butt and the front and what 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.350
 What I do is just put myself 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.510
 from here and I say I have this measure and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.780
 I do triki triki triki triki triki triki 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.480
 until hitting the wall and is 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.730
 and I'm left with the same measure, that is , not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.709
 that make that middle of the butt be 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.660
 same as the front one then 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.569
 we do so we put our finger on the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 triki knee triki triki triki has 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.350
 what to say triqui triqui if it does not go out 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.890
 sad hahaha 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.950
 and we arrived here and notice that is the point 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.790
 from the bottom look how it went down a little 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.520
 about the front all the shot and the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.670
 back shot we draw it with ruler 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.910
 remember that here came with rule rule 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.910
 here in the waist rule between the two 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.940
 points of the forward shot and also 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.970
 we are going to draw it with a rule here 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.730
 and with rule here but this I'm going to draw 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.820
 in dotted lines because because the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.240
 middle part in the middle part say to 25 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.690
 12 and a half one and a half inwards that 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.180
 is the roundness that the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.940
 shot of the ass once I drew 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.920
 all this with rule and directly 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.910
 when he cut it when the scissors passed 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.950
 I'm going to round it out rounded angles 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.560
 practically without touching it there is no 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.460
 round dominates in grief I do not touch it and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.700
 just from where I and there I have the shot 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.260
 crotch of the rear attention with 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.110
 this because this one has a measure that does not 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.420
 he sees it as exaggerated as big 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.700
 and it's very important in pants 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.650
 respect that crotch measure that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.960
 it would be the horizontal development of the shot 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.490
 of the pants what happens sometimes as I do not 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.130
 come in Latin I say good he sliced 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.590
 a total bit is not going to notice brings 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.600
 a very ugly defect and it is very common that 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.100
 defect of the fat ladies that the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.440
 we see in mar del plata with envelopes 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.920
 that are walking from the s 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.920
 they are summarized that because there is a lack of travel 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.510
 horizontal crotch shot 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.680
 yes one even me when I work for 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.180
 women I have to make a pair of pants 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.590
 a woman who has thick legs that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.530
 It is wider 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.150
 I always leave you a little more 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.860
 concert just in case because sometimes 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.380
 it is preferable what a sense a 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.540
 little sea ​​and the pants fall in 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.570
 a little bit of mexico in my pants 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.920
 man's suits pants 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.810
 of a man's dress I bought myself a 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.520
 dress pants and I can not use it 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.510
 because it makes me uncomfortable because I'm walking 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.490
 and I feel that I am shocked by what happens 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.710
 when it crashes forward miss shot 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.860
 Crotch in interaction and many 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.660
 times the manufacturers to save you the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.980
 slices in the crotch direction no 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.590
 it's true because that's how they come in 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.770
 how best the mobiles in the only case 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.810
 that I allow them to reduce a little the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.000
 crotch shot is when we go to 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.770
 work stretch fabrics for example 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.020
 in a fabric of jogging on a fabric what 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.690
 be me and the chalk I do not feel that they have 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.690
 a little bounce because in that case the 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.020
 bounce plays like in our favor no 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.240
 closes 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.400
 that is, we have a shot between legs 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.280
 that stretches and plays in our favor and 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.740
 another little secret if they have a pair of pants 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.050
 that defect is not true that they sting 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.210
 that that happens a lot in the Bermuda shorts 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.009
 the lady because the bermuda is there that 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.930
 make shortie sucks in the crotch 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.539
 in a long pants out there does not suck 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.699
 so much but it gets in all folds 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.430
 when it's short this back of all 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.129
 folds like this makes the pants look very ugly 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.860
 it's not true a secret to fix a 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.330
 pants that has that defect is to treat 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.889
 to find a piece of it 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.220
 sometimes we can remove it from 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.820
 inside the pockets and add what 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.580
 that was called before the baby 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.500
 handles was a cut-out site 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.750
 even the old pants the 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.520
 man tailoring came was like a 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.650
 clipping cited that it was made 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.920
 so if I have a short shot you 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.290
 I added that triangle and that improved the 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:16.470
 fall of the trousers is preferable that 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:25.610
 about that nephew who form a little 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:25.610
 loose and not too much your country more red 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.810
 that is one of the flaws of the pants 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.520
 we follow them because in the next class 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.890
 I want to show you the flaws of the shot 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.450
 of the trousers and how to accommodate them when 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.700
 there is a big queue when going with the sheet 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.240
 when expansion because not to all the 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.430
 The same trousers are the same 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.490
 this truth to queue I've seen 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:51.210
 in Chile they do not see it here they do 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.050
 as a kind of sewing triangle 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.890
 here 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.890
 ah up 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.740
 we continue with the mónica teacher 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.670
 godfroid makes us some decorated flower pots 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.670
 with acrylics
