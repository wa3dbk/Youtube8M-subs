building on from far cry or lost game
FarCry<00:00:29.440> was<00:00:29.860> our<00:00:30.340> very<00:00:30.580> first<00:00:30.700> effort<00:00:31.180> to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
FarCry was our very first effort to

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.140 
FarCry was our very first effort to
build<00:00:31.630> a<00:00:31.930> video<00:00:32.230> game<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.850> while<00:00:33.850> we<00:00:34.000> had<00:00:34.120> a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
build a video game and while we had a

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.640 
build a video game and while we had a
lot<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.330> success<00:00:34.750> with<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.080> lot<00:00:35.200> of<00:00:35.350> fun<00:00:35.530> with

lot of success with it a lot of fun with

it we weren't able to quite unleash the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.770 
it we weren't able to quite unleash the
creativity<00:00:39.340> that<00:00:39.580> we<00:00:39.940> thought<00:00:40.150> we<00:00:40.450> wanted<00:00:40.720> to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
creativity that we thought we wanted to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.970 
creativity that we thought we wanted to
have<00:00:40.989> there<00:00:41.380> were<00:00:41.470> still<00:00:41.710> too<00:00:41.830> many

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980

have there were still too many
restrictions<00:00:42.220> that<00:00:42.760> we<00:00:43.059> had<00:00:43.629> on<00:00:43.660> ourselves<00:00:43.930> in

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
restrictions that we had on ourselves in

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.869 
restrictions that we had on ourselves in
terms<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.860> what<00:00:45.250> we<00:00:45.370> could<00:00:45.489> do<00:00:45.640> with<00:00:45.760> the

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
terms of what we could do with the

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.970 
terms of what we could do with the
levels<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:46.750> had<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:46.900> vision<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.470> we<00:00:47.770> could

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
levels and we had a vision that we could

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.799 
levels and we had a vision that we could
make<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.309> games<00:00:48.520> much<00:00:48.850> more<00:00:49.090> interesting<00:00:49.660> if

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
make the games much more interesting if

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.600 
make the games much more interesting if
we<00:00:50.230> could<00:00:50.379> make<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.650> environments<00:00:51.190> much<00:00:51.370> more

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
we could make the environments much more

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.250 
we could make the environments much more
interactive<00:00:51.850> it's<00:00:52.510> Ben's<00:00:52.690> kind<00:00:52.900> of<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.050> holy

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
interactive it's Ben's kind of the holy

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.930 
interactive it's Ben's kind of the holy
grail<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.620> video<00:00:54.010> game<00:00:54.220> design<00:00:54.580> for<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.790> long

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
grail of video game design for a long

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.270 
grail of video game design for a long
time<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.510> if<00:00:55.930> it's<00:00:56.110> in<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.290> environment<00:00:56.680> it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
time that if it's in the environment it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.920 
time that if it's in the environment it
should<00:00:57.519> feel<00:00:57.550> like<00:00:57.790> it's<00:00:58.210> really<00:00:58.540> there<00:00:58.780> you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
should feel like it's really there you

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.420 
should feel like it's really there you
could<00:00:59.080> really<00:00:59.409> be<00:00:59.530> able<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.769> interact<00:00:59.980> with<00:01:00.250> it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
could really be able to interact with it

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.299 
could really be able to interact with it
and<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.629> we<00:01:02.170> had<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.470> do<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:03.010> way<00:01:03.129> that

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
and so we had to do that in a way that

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.250 
and so we had to do that in a way that
was<00:01:03.400> systematic<00:01:04.120> it<00:01:04.269> wasn't<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:04.720> scripted

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
was systematic it wasn't just scripted

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.410 
was systematic it wasn't just scripted
it<00:01:05.409> wasn't<00:01:05.710> just<00:01:05.800> pre<00:01:06.100> can<00:01:06.370> but<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.180> at<00:01:07.300> any

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
it wasn't just pre can but that at any

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.330 
it wasn't just pre can but that at any
point<00:01:07.690> in<00:01:07.870> time<00:01:07.900> these<00:01:08.710> things<00:01:08.950> could<00:01:09.130> happen

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
point in time these things could happen

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.190 
point in time these things could happen
in<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.700> world<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.600> was<00:01:10.750> what<00:01:10.900> we<00:01:10.990> set

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
in the world and that was what we set

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.860 
in the world and that was what we set
out<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.350> do<00:01:11.560> with<00:01:11.710> FARC<00:01:11.950> with<00:01:12.370> crisis<00:01:12.909> from<00:01:13.659> the

Far<00:01:14.050> Cry<00:01:14.200> engine<00:01:14.620> can<00:01:14.979> you<00:01:15.040> give<00:01:15.190> any<00:01:15.310> concrete

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
Far Cry engine can you give any concrete

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.480 
Far Cry engine can you give any concrete
examples<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.690> how<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:16.960> try<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.320> do<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.740> well

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
examples of how you try to do this well

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.430 
examples of how you try to do this well
for<00:01:18.729> example<00:01:18.790> in<00:01:19.390> every<00:01:19.690> level<00:01:20.020> that's<00:01:20.260> ever

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
for example in every level that's ever

been built prior to this you can hide

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.240 
been built prior to this you can hide
behind<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.140> tree<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.560> tank<00:01:23.799> couldn't<00:01:24.130> roll

it run over it and get to you and that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.130 
it run over it and get to you and that
broke<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.280> immersion<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.360> had<00:01:28.510> titanium

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
broke the immersion and we had titanium

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.870 
broke the immersion and we had titanium
trees<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:29.650> didn't<00:01:29.890> respond<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.640> fact

that you had this great big explosion

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.530 
that you had this great big explosion
just<00:01:32.770> happened<00:01:33.160> in<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.310> world<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:34.150> know<00:01:34.270> that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
just happened in the world you know that

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.510 
just happened in the world you know that
that<00:01:34.960> made<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.260> clear<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.890> weren't<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.310> a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
that made it clear that you weren't in a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.100 
that made it clear that you weren't in a
real<00:01:36.670> world<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.120> were<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.450> video<00:01:37.690> game<00:01:37.720> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
real world you were in a video game and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.160 
real world you were in a video game and
we<00:01:38.800> wanted<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.130> make<00:01:39.430> that<00:01:39.700> not<00:01:40.570> only<00:01:40.720> feel

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
we wanted to make that not only feel

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.800 
we wanted to make that not only feel
more<00:01:41.440> realistic<00:01:41.770> but<00:01:42.340> also<00:01:42.490> how<00:01:42.880> interacting

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
more realistic but also how interacting

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.350 
more realistic but also how interacting
gameplay<00:01:44.230> so<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.070> if<00:01:45.190> there<00:01:45.340> was<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.550> if<00:01:46.150> there

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
gameplay so that if there was a if there

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.700 
gameplay so that if there was a if there
was<00:01:46.450> cover<00:01:46.690> in<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:46.960> world<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.440> wanted<00:01:47.650> to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
was cover in the world and you wanted to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.580 
was cover in the world and you wanted to
take<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.640> out<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:49.150> could<00:01:49.300> take<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.510> out<00:01:49.780> by

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
take it out you could take it out by

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.710 
take it out you could take it out by
expending<00:01:50.950> some<00:01:51.340> ammo<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.120> that<00:01:52.480> way

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
expending some ammo on it and that way

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.690 
expending some ammo on it and that way
the<00:01:53.200> AI<00:01:53.320> had<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.680> respond<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.370> fact<00:01:54.610> that

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
the AI had a respond to the fact that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.190 
the AI had a respond to the fact that
now<00:01:55.030> there<00:01:55.240> was<00:01:55.300> no<00:01:55.480> hiding<00:01:55.630> place<00:01:55.810> there

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
now there was no hiding place there

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.720 
now there was no hiding place there
anymore<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:56.710> they<00:01:57.010> had<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.220> find<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.490> new<00:01:57.610> way

quicker or you can use your cloak and
actually<00:02:39.240> become<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.690> invisible<00:02:39.930> harder<00:02:40.560> to

allows you to decide how you're going to
play<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> scene<00:02:47.580> out<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.180> allows<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.600> go

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
play a scene out and it allows you to go

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.199 
play a scene out and it allows you to go
play<00:02:48.840> back<00:02:49.110> multiple<00:02:50.040> times<00:02:50.100> different<00:02:51.060> ways

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
play back multiple times different ways

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.970 
play back multiple times different ways
and<00:02:51.420> see<00:02:51.600> how<00:02:51.690> things<00:02:51.959> work<00:02:52.110> out<00:02:52.290> isn't<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
and see how things work out isn't that a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
and see how things work out isn't that a
very<00:02:53.280> hard<00:02:53.580> thing<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:54.060> balance<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.600> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
very hard thing to balance out it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.750 
very hard thing to balance out it
greatly<00:02:55.260> increases<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.860> amount<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.340> testing

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
greatly increases the amount of testing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.490 
greatly increases the amount of testing
time<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.390> put<00:02:57.540> into<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.810> level<00:02:58.110> because

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
time we have to put into a level because

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500 
time we have to put into a level because
obviously<00:02:58.709> when<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.310> build<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.640> level<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.180> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
obviously when you build a level if you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.210 
obviously when you build a level if you
build<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.810> around<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.170> idea<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.590> certain

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
build it around the idea that certain

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.979 
build it around the idea that certain
areas<00:03:02.459> are<00:03:02.790> out<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.120> bounds<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.750> can't

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
areas are out of bounds and you can't

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.930 
areas are out of bounds and you can't
get<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.350> them<00:03:04.500> therefore<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.459> don't<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.790> to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
get to them therefore you don't have to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.880 
get to them therefore you don't have to
worry<00:03:06.150> about<00:03:06.330> what<00:03:07.050> will<00:03:07.080> happen<00:03:07.200> if<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.709> do

worry about what will happen if you do

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.860 
worry about what will happen if you do

get there in the AI gets there then

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.449 
get there in the AI gets there then
suddenly<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.410> have<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> ability<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:11.100> jump

suddenly you have the ability to jump

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.400 
suddenly you have the ability to jump
twice<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.940> high<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.239> could<00:03:12.450> before<00:03:12.840> now

all<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.800> sudden<00:03:14.130> you're<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.489> an<00:03:14.580> unexpected

all of a sudden you're in an unexpected

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.360 
all of a sudden you're in an unexpected
situation<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.650> designer<00:03:17.010> might<00:03:17.220> not

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
situation and the designer might not

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.440 
situation and the designer might not
have<00:03:17.489> thought<00:03:17.550> about<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.970> before<00:03:18.209> you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
have thought about it before you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.240 
have thought about it before you
actually<00:03:18.750> got<00:03:19.050> there<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.650> yes<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.220> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
actually got there so yes we have to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.340 
actually got there so yes we have to
think<00:03:20.550> more<00:03:20.610> carefully<00:03:20.910> about<00:03:21.209> things<00:03:21.690> we

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
think more carefully about things we

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.479 
think more carefully about things we
have<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:22.620> about<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.340> if

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
have to think about the what if

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.330 
have to think about the what if
situations<00:03:24.209> what<00:03:24.450> if<00:03:24.600> instead<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.340> following

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
situations what if instead of following

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.040 
situations what if instead of following
the<00:03:26.370> vision<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> game<00:03:27.120> designer<00:03:27.510> we

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
the vision of the game designer we

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.690 
the vision of the game designer we
decide<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.440> go<00:03:28.560> down<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.769> different<00:03:28.890> path<00:03:29.280> and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
decide to go down a different path and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.949 
decide to go down a different path and
take<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.850> different<00:03:30.060> approach<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.630> problem

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
take a different approach to the problem

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.449 
take a different approach to the problem
and<00:03:31.350> we<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> make<00:03:31.709> sure<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.130> those<00:03:32.250> are

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
and we have to make sure that those are

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.759 
and we have to make sure that those are
just<00:03:32.580> as<00:03:32.760> fun<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.750> takes<00:03:33.959> an<00:03:34.140> additional

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
just as fun and that takes an additional

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.530 
just as fun and that takes an additional
amount<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.100> time<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:35.610> at<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.910> end<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.299> makes

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
amount of time but at the end it makes

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.120 
amount of time but at the end it makes
for<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.079> has<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.410> lot<00:03:37.620> more<00:03:37.650> replay

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
for a game that has a lot more replay

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
for a game that has a lot more replay
value<00:03:38.340> than<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.450> playing<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.780> through<00:03:39.959> one

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
value than just playing it through one

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.300 
value than just playing it through one
time<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.739> put<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:40.920> away<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.160> never

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
time and then you put it away and never

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.890 
time and then you put it away and never
want<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.610> see<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.820> again<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.239> also<00:03:42.390> gives<00:03:42.570> a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
want to see it again and it also gives a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.870 
want to see it again and it also gives a
lot<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.200> potential<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.010> very<00:03:44.610> fun

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
lot of potential for a very fun

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.460 
lot of potential for a very fun
multiplayer<00:03:45.239> game<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.079> something

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
multiplayer game is that something

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.720 
multiplayer game is that something
you're<00:03:46.590> looking<00:03:46.739> at<00:03:47.040> yeah<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.549> be

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
you're looking at yeah we have to be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.430 
you're looking at yeah we have to be
careful<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.120> balance<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> multiplayer<00:03:49.110> fun

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
careful to balance the multiplayer fun

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.530 
careful to balance the multiplayer fun
with<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.769> multiplayer<00:03:50.190> exploits<00:03:50.850> there's<00:03:51.390> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
with the multiplayer exploits there's a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.330 
with the multiplayer exploits there's a
fine<00:03:51.750> line<00:03:51.780> between<00:03:52.019> being<00:03:52.560> something<00:03:53.190> that's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
fine line between being something that's

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.740 
fine line between being something that's
innovative<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.030> fun<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.420> something<00:03:54.630> that's

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
innovative and fun and something that's

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.170 
innovative and fun and something that's
being<00:03:55.019> an<00:03:55.170> unfair<00:03:55.530> advantage<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.730> doesn't

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
being an unfair advantage but it doesn't

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.789 
being an unfair advantage but it doesn't
open<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.750> lot<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.989> possibilities<00:03:58.410> that

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
open up a lot of possibilities that

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.229 
open up a lot of possibilities that
weren't<00:03:59.040> there<00:03:59.160> before<00:03:59.220> thank<00:03:59.820> you<00:03:59.910> very<00:04:00.060> much

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
weren't there before thank you very much

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.230 
weren't there before thank you very much
for<00:04:00.269> your<00:04:00.480> time<00:04:00.600> thank<00:04:01.110> you
