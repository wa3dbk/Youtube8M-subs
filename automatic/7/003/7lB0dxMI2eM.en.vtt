00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.170
 and cook with david let's prepare 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.500
 Chicken Coke Ingredients Chicken Two 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.980

 a can of Coca-Cola salt and pepper 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.010
 oil 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.890
 we'll start feeding the chicken in this 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.660
 case I used chicken wings and two 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.820
 small thighs 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 but you can do with the parts that 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.620
 more like them as long as they have 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.770
 the same size to be cooked to the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.770
 time 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 in a saucepan with a little oil let's go 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.299
 placing the chicken and let lasting 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.299
 on both sides over high heat 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 while the chicken is worshiped we will cut the 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.890
 julienne onion 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.140
 once I'm going to that degree what 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.140
 we booked in a separate bowl 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.810
 we lower the fire and in the same case 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.330
 we have taken the chicken we add the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.470
 onion 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.570
 we salt and mix well 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.570
 we're going to press it on medium heat 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.360
 when we see that the onion is more or 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.260
 less soft we add the pill 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.260
 chopped broth 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.610
 a trickle of about two or 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.610
 three tablespoons 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.450
 we mix the ketchup well with the onion 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.480
 we add the chicken that we had reserved 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.200
 we cover with the cocacola we will cook 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.200
 medium low heat of 15 to 30 minutes 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.050
 during cooking we will mix and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.290
 giving wilson a lot 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.540
 the chicken should be cooked and the sauce should 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.540
 reduce remaining creamy 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.290
 and we have our chicken ready 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.670
