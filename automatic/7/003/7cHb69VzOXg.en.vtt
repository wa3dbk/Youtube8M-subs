okay<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:10.980> Norwood<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:11.790> attack<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.809> if<00:00:12.990> this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
okay so Norwood we attack in so if this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.460 
okay so Norwood we attack in so if this
went<00:00:13.469> back<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.610> way<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.179> that's<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.199> best

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
went back this way so that's the best

00:00:16.470 --> 00:01:01.570 
went back this way so that's the best
point<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.660> may<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.720> your<00:00:18.869> panel

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:02:23.729 

okay

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:45.280 

but<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.920> maybe<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.370> hard<00:02:43.760> work<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.569> you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
but this is maybe the hard work and you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.990 
but this is maybe the hard work and you
need<00:02:48.700> 20<00:02:49.700> over<00:02:50.030> there<00:02:50.769> because<00:02:53.709> part<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:55.670> no

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
need 20 over there because part is no

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.900
