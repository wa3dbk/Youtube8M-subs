00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.770 

there's<00:01:09.740> sometimes<00:01:10.190> as<00:01:10.580> an<00:01:10.880> extra<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.540> think

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
there's sometimes as an extra I think

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.470 
there's sometimes as an extra I think
there's<00:01:11.960> an<00:01:12.140> extra<00:01:12.470> storm<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:12.920> there<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.220> the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
there's an extra storm in there on the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.090 
there's an extra storm in there on the
on<00:01:14.480> when<00:01:14.840> you're<00:01:15.020> adding<00:01:15.230> your<00:01:15.500> finger<00:01:15.860> there

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
on when you're adding your finger there

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.840 
on when you're adding your finger there
but<00:01:16.490> I'm<00:01:17.180> sure<00:01:17.360> you'd<00:01:17.540> figure<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.990> out<00:01:18.850> and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
but I'm sure you'd figure that out and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.280 
but I'm sure you'd figure that out and
then<00:01:20.120> right<00:01:20.330> after<00:01:20.480> that<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.780> want<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.200> get

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
then right after that you want to get

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.950 
then right after that you want to get
yourself<00:01:21.710> into<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.130> D<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:25.420> then<00:01:26.420> adding<00:01:26.930> your

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
yourself into a D and then adding your

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.950 
yourself into a D and then adding your
pinkie<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.280> third<00:01:29.240> fret<00:01:29.510> sixth<00:01:29.930> string

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
down same strum pattern again and then

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:47.110 
down same strum pattern again and then
you're<00:01:34.400> taking<00:01:34.760> off<00:01:34.910> your<00:01:35.120> pinky<00:01:44.410> okay<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:46.120> all
