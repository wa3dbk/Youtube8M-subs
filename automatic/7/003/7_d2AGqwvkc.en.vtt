00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.040
 my session with the newborn 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.049
 just happened she had 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.629
 tomorrow she will do two weeks 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 intouch 14 days ago and this is the 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.539
 time limit that can do what is 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.849
 good to take newborn photos up to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.660
 15 days to prepare this house for 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.880
 up studio of natural light and 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 specifically with the studio to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 newborn the main thing at the time 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.700
 to take a photo of a newborn to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 prepare the environment and prepare 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
 temperature of the environment and so that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.240
 people heat the environment because 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 newborn he needs zygo heat 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.690
 if he lets it go cold it gets 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.690
 restless gets know do not get restless 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.940
 to help the baby to sleep and to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.400
 stay calm and relax 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 we put a heater up there 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.430
 People heat the house, are you sure? 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.860
 All right, to warm up, to come in, to have 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.379
 sure that the baby is warm and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.510
 but who had we still use 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.940
 those portable heaters 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 This is the heater I used to 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.540
 vote directly baby not too close 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.090
 but it is enough to close a little 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.120
 even warmer because in those photos 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.980
 we take the baby to fraldinha 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.080
 avoid any accidents 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.730
 It is best to keep enem well. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 and does not feel the difference of 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.190
 temperature once you took the outfit 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 it and the skirt steak that I did that to me 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.400
 to adjust to an environment because 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.500
 then the house is already heated and has a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 heater and I'll show you how 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.070
 I did the serap to do a middle studio. 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.320
 improvised to say so to take 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.610
 these hypotheses which, in fact, have 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.479
 I'm crazy to show you. 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.250
 You guys I 'm super basic I have 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.930
 in my living room that has a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 window facing south 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 here in the United States the windows 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.710
 facing the sus are equivalent to 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.189
 windows facing north of brazil 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.960
 ie windows in Brazil handle Pronorte 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:14.500
 a direct sun during part of the day 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.720
 and it is usually in the afternoon then as the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.750
 It's four o'clock this afternoon. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.760
 I closed the curtains to have this light 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.450
 but matched by an environment and race 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.980
 that way you are for you 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.410
 first I have to think that he is 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.470
 zinho fan okay I put support 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.200
 Here that same line is he's 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.020
 turned by a non-direct baby and does not want 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.460
 a super hot type of heat at neither time 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.890
 you do not have to keep an eye out 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.280
 nor does it get super heated and has been 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 very sensitive then much heat or 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.890
 very cold do not help the heater zinho 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.650
 the bandit way 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.480
 This is good, and it's not 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.030
 folded because I just got off the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.950
 dryer the blankets my complaint 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.080
 was gone but I had done this before 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.330
 come with my blankets that 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.130
 I have and I did he was 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.860
 I never cleaned the dryer again 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.230
 just the max money they stay 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.950
 with what else because they 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.260
 were kept in the closet and there was a 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.100
 little ice cream and I thought it was going to be bad 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.470
 pro baby 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.190
 so what I did was use this one 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.960
 a hair dryer hair dryer 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.670
 I just voted in the dryer for 20 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.140
 minutes to make them very hot 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.120
 then no time to double because the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.810
 people ended up not even using it but I'm going 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.030
 Show you just like an example. 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.190
 here in the corner 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.020
 This is the main one I have here. 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:54.070
 This one I used is an ordinary booth. 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.320
 drop table and there I 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.450
 I just looked for two blankets that I have 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.310
 and I did not use clips or anything 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.860
 I might even have used a clamp that they 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.060
 strong and strong hooks 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.820
 But I did not need it, I just 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.680
 blanket in such a way that it would not fall 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.790
 because he is heavy I put two layers 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.830
 blanket 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.570
 one that is the blanket I wanted to use but 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.750
 He's a little thin so I got this one. 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.300
 blanket a bit thicker to give a 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.430
 little more support and do this 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.789
 blanket here more 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.310
 the defense still get to take this 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.039
 become the change in time 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.780
 When it takes to take a photo, we do not want to 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.300
 many folds in the bottom is for more 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.650
 to be out of focus, we want to leave 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.570
 less damage possible 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.580
 as I do not have puff that is usually the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:48.720
 that is used in the professional studio I 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:55.770
 Who I did I put this ibope through 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:58.110
 your name and also with the cover 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.050
 who will do this will give more support 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.050
 it was and not even in the hour of enem here it goes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.759
 have more support and that he will give 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.860
 will you give that fundat had that 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:14.699
 ceded are able to see but will 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.120
 do the enem is going to give the situation more 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.220
 do enem in the photo 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.610
 so if you do not need more support 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.860
 I can easily get a little skirt 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.810
 with a blanket like that did not miss anything 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.449
 to give more support let's say I 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.370
 I want more support than this one on my leg. 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:41.060
 that is falling 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.060
 I just came down here and gently 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:49.050
 add stronger and there you can do 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:56.820
 to give more interest you can put 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:06:00.080
 another discovery is like this and there you go 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.050
 changing the serap any way you want 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.560
 and if the belenenses do not have a diaper 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.349
 can be put a piece is the diapers 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.449
 protectors hot by andrÃ© thinks the 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.400
 our generation is not a mattress 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.930
 we can put under the 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.159
 also covered not to make a 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.430
 major damage 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:23.699
 if you need more lusa than you are 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:27.240
 the window or you want to decrease the 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.390
 Shadows that are making us not even 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:35.520
 would you like 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:41.740
 super is delicate and soft in the last enem 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:43.090
 This is going to bring more light to 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.190
 this side of enem 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.620
 anything white is good if I 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:53.020
 Wish I could get you this blanket. 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.220
 here and put here that will give the same 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.980
 It is made 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.550
 Ok so this is what I usually use 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.380
 these are my tips and I hope you 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.200
