00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.860
 the first video in a series where I go 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 pass the tools so that you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.680
 prepare a diet that combines 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 with you with your lifestyle with 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.040
 How do you like to eat with the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.410
 hours you like to eat or 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.720
 that fits in your day to day in a way 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.610
 that you buy the diet without big 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.100
 sacrifice and achieve the goal 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.520
 final because it's no use to go on a diet 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.230
 What works for someone and what is in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.150
 I study the magazine what you have to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.470
 stay a long time without eating what you 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.180
 have to eat something that you do not 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.880
 likes that it's no use to lose weight 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.500
 fast and then re-fatten everything 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.240
 again because what you've done is nothing 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 You made a very 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.870
 great for getting those say 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.480
 reach the goal before you start 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 this first step it is necessary not to have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.880
 fear of the balance who is and will use the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.380
 weigh in the balance to see which is the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.910
 the number it presents 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.770
 Just for you, no secret, nobody wants to know. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 of anything else and take the measure of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.579
 circumference of the belly and can not 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 take measurements on the belly now and 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.719
 here below the peta much more 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.060
 The idea of ​​being faithful to the law is the 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.310
 result in three weeks 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.200
 You'll be arrested again and you'll do it. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.119
 this in the meantime you do not 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.009
 will use the scale on the tape more 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.189
 first step is to keep a diary 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.189
 to feed 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.329
 then the idea during the day I eat 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.859
 anything and write your business 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.689
 on writing paper 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.969
 imagine at ten six in the morning and took a 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.069
 glass of water is also worth the 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.600
 calories is not important important is 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.289
 important you wrote how much you 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.420
 drink what time you eat what you eat 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.090
 When you're hungry, will you help? 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.549
 to identify your food errors 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.009
 So how long are you going to do? 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.389
 this is ideal if it is five or seven 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 days right 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:56.310
 It's important for you to get it. 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.679
 understand the variations of your week not 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 is what may have influenced the is another 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.429
 important note to note in your diary 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.409
 what made you how much easier it is for us 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.409
 You know that by doing something wrong and 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.360
 does it anyway but normally what I 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.400
 as I think it is not right either 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.390
 this diary will help you to look 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 from another angle later 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.069
 I did not realize that I ate two 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.800
 really I could have eaten one are you going 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.510
 start saying understand consciousness is the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.110
 first step so register 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.819
 to feed 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
 After making this diary, I'll 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.010
 help you identify the mistakes that you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 committed and corrects them so it 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.110
