Cyclery everyone knows how much a noisy
chain<00:00:07.859> or<00:00:08.250> poor<00:00:08.700> shifting<00:00:09.120> performance<00:00:09.599> can

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
chain or poor shifting performance can

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.440 
chain or poor shifting performance can
really<00:00:10.320> ruin<00:00:10.650> your<00:00:10.860> day<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.550> your<00:00:11.849> ride<00:00:12.059> and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
we're going to show you some options

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.519 
we're going to show you some options
today<00:00:14.580> either<00:00:14.969> wet<00:00:15.330> or<00:00:15.540> dry<00:00:15.719> lubes<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.410> can

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
today either wet or dry lubes that can

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650 
today either wet or dry lubes that can
solve<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.070> problem<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.480> weather

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
solve that problem and the weather

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.120 
solve that problem and the weather
conditions<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.410> might<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> use

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
conditions that you might want to use

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
conditions that you might want to use
either<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.420> first<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> take<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
either or so first we're going to take a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.170 
either or so first we're going to take a
look<00:00:22.439> at<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.859> they<00:00:22.980> call<00:00:23.189> dry<00:00:23.609> lubes

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
look at what they call dry lubes

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.050 
look at what they call dry lubes
now<00:00:24.510> these<00:00:24.750> lubes<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:26.250> put<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.670> wet

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
now these lubes you actually put on wet

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.169 
now these lubes you actually put on wet
but<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:27.840> they'll<00:00:28.019> dry<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.680> waxy<00:00:29.279> film<00:00:29.609> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
but then they'll dry to a waxy film so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
but then they'll dry to a waxy film so
what<00:00:30.330> right<00:00:30.570> here<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
what right here we have the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.229 
what right here we have the
rock-and-roll<00:00:31.619> lubricants<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
rock-and-roll lubricants this is

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.780 
rock-and-roll lubricants this is
actually<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.170> agent<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.800> gets<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
actually the agent that gets the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.790 
actually the agent that gets the
lubricant<00:00:36.270> onto<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.750> chain<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
lubricant onto your chain and this is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
lubricant onto your chain and this is
actually<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.520> lubricant<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
actually the lubricant here at the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
actually the lubricant here at the
bottom<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.739> waxy<00:00:41.219> substance

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
bottom it's just this waxy substance

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.510 
bottom it's just this waxy substance
that<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.510> mix<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> rest<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that you mix up with the rest of the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
that you mix up with the rest of the
lube<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> pour<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
lube and then you pour it on to your

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
lube and then you pour it on to your
change-up<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.460> onto<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:47.730> chain<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
change-up and onto your chain and that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.110 
change-up and onto your chain and that
waxy<00:00:49.350> substance<00:00:49.530> coats<00:00:50.309> your<00:00:50.520> chain<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
waxy substance coats your chain and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330 
waxy substance coats your chain and
really<00:00:51.390> repels<00:00:51.780> dirt<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> keeps<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.070> chain

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
really repels dirt and keeps your chain

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.580 
really repels dirt and keeps your chain
very<00:00:53.670> clean<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:54.690> how<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> wax<00:00:55.350> based

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
very clean that's how all the wax based

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
very clean that's how all the wax based
lubricants<00:00:56.309> work<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> rock-and-roll<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
lubricants work and the rock-and-roll is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
lubricants work and the rock-and-roll is
really<00:00:58.859> nice<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.489> cleans<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.270> lubed

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
really nice because it cleans and lubed

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
really nice because it cleans and lubed
your<00:01:00.809> chain<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> same<00:01:01.500> time<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.850> want

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
your chain at the same time if you want

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
your chain at the same time if you want
something<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.470> repels<00:01:05.100> dirt<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.519> has

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
something that really repels dirt it has

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
something that really repels dirt it has
a<00:01:05.670> clumping<00:01:06.210> mechanism<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.170> clumps<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
a clumping mechanism that clumps the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
a clumping mechanism that clumps the
dirt<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.610> sheds<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.360> off

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
dirt and then it all sheds right off

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870 
dirt and then it all sheds right off
that<00:01:10.350> would<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> clean<00:01:11.010> ride<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.610> white

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that would be the clean ride from white

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
that would be the clean ride from white
lightning<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.260> Teflon<00:01:14.189> based

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
lightning and then the Teflon based

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.810 
lightning and then the Teflon based
lubes<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.150> try<00:01:15.540> flow<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> finish<00:01:17.070> line<00:01:17.340> dry

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
lubes are try flow and finish line dry

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
lubes are try flow and finish line dry
and<00:01:18.409> those<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.860> great<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:21.210> repelling

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and those are really great for repelling

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
and those are really great for repelling
the<00:01:21.960> dirt<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.979> even<00:01:23.250> letting<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the dirt like just not even letting the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490 
the dirt like just not even letting the
dirt<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.509> chain<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.170> doesn't

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
dirt get on to your chain it doesn't

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
dirt get on to your chain it doesn't
stick<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.850> keeps<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.240> chain

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
stick at all and that keeps your chain

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
stick at all and that keeps your chain
very<00:01:27.810> quiet<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.500> clean<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.909> next

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
very quiet and clean all right so next

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
very quiet and clean all right so next
we're<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.720> over<00:01:31.140> some<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.740> they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we're going to go over some what they

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
we're going to go over some what they
call<00:01:32.040> wet<00:01:32.460> lubes<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> those<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.840> your

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
call wet lubes and those are your

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.100 
call wet lubes and those are your
oil-based<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:34.890> bio<00:01:35.310> based<00:01:35.700> lubes<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.509> some

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
oil-based or bio based lubes and some

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
oil-based or bio based lubes and some
options<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> wet<00:01:38.280> Lube<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.360> really

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
options for a wet Lube which are really

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
options for a wet Lube which are really
great<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.470> wet<00:01:40.740> conditions<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.670> they

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
great for wet conditions because they

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
great for wet conditions because they
don't<00:01:42.000> wash<00:01:42.450> off<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> try<00:01:44.130> flow

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
don't wash off and so this is try flow

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.999 
don't wash off and so this is try flow
