00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
knew was that after a certain time if

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.259 
knew was that after a certain time if
the<00:02:39.010> certain<00:02:39.250> period<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.519> time<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:40.060> weather

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
the certain period of time the weather

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.580 
the certain period of time the weather
would<00:02:40.569> disappear<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:42.579> will<00:02:42.760> show<00:02:43.120> exactly

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
would disappear and it will show exactly

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.160 
would disappear and it will show exactly
like<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.739> location<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.400> anything<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.700> that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
like the location or anything like that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.059 
like the location or anything like that
so<00:02:47.170> because<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:47.980> don't<00:02:48.250> use<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.849> GPS<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.500> sims

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
so because I don't use the GPS and sims

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.589 
so because I don't use the GPS and sims
for<00:02:51.400> some<00:02:51.519> reason<00:02:51.760> what<00:02:51.879> Samsung<00:02:52.269> products

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
for some reason what Samsung products

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.569 
for some reason what Samsung products
have<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.780> try<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.019> force<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.829> use<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:54.129> gps

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
have to try to force you to use the gps

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.050 
have to try to force you to use the gps

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.010 
I think that calculating the memo those
are<00:04:16.490> the<00:04:16.580> only<00:04:16.700> two<00:04:16.970> things<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.300> really<00:04:17.540> used<00:04:17.810> at
