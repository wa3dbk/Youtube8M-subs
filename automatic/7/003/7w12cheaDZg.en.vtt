00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
now and then let's use the earth attack

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.100 
now and then let's use the earth attack
I<00:03:10.890> mean<00:03:11.070> Terra<00:03:11.370> attack<00:03:11.760> earth<00:03:12.150> Terra<00:03:12.660> same

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
I mean Terra attack earth Terra same

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.390 
I mean Terra attack earth Terra same
thing<00:03:14.690> there<00:03:15.690> he<00:03:15.840> goes<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.530> he<00:03:16.770> throws<00:03:17.100> his

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
thing there he goes and he throws his

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700 
thing there he goes and he throws his
axe<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.240> think<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> axe<00:03:18.750> actually<00:03:19.200> goes

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
axe and I think the axe actually goes

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.620 
axe and I think the axe actually goes
