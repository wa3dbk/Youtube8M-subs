00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.139 

this<00:00:02.620> is<00:00:02.800> a<00:00:02.830> power<00:00:03.310> distribution<00:00:03.610> board<00:00:04.060> I

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:04.149 
this is a power distribution board I

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:05.880 
this is a power distribution board I
just<00:00:04.330> picked<00:00:04.510> up<00:00:04.600> from<00:00:04.720> banggood<00:00:05.230> this<00:00:05.590> one<00:00:05.799> is

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:05.890 
just picked up from banggood this one is

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.549 
just picked up from banggood this one is
36<00:00:06.400> by<00:00:06.549> 36<00:00:07.210> millimeters<00:00:07.720> so<00:00:08.109> it's<00:00:08.320> not<00:00:08.440> the

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
36 by 36 millimeters so it's not the

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.869 
36 by 36 millimeters so it's not the
same<00:00:08.740> size<00:00:09.010> as<00:00:09.280> an<00:00:09.430> Asda<00:00:09.700> 32<00:00:10.209> or<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:11.520> cc3d<00:00:12.520> board

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
same size as an Asda 32 or a cc3d board

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.420 
same size as an Asda 32 or a cc3d board
now<00:00:13.480> it's<00:00:14.260> a<00:00:14.469> you<00:00:14.680> know<00:00:14.740> here's<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.039> 50

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
now it's a you know here's a 50

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.769 
now it's a you know here's a 50
millimeter<00:00:15.610> just<00:00:16.000> to<00:00:16.119> show<00:00:16.299> some<00:00:16.330> size

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
millimeter just to show some size

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.320 
millimeter just to show some size
comparisons<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:18.150> here's<00:00:19.150> another

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
comparisons and here's another

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.210 
comparisons and here's another
distribution<00:00:20.019> board<00:00:20.259> and<00:00:20.470> this<00:00:20.650> one<00:00:20.859> doesn't

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
distribution board and this one doesn't

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.519 
distribution board and this one doesn't
have<00:00:21.250> any<00:00:21.400> special<00:00:21.880> outputs<00:00:22.480> it<00:00:22.689> just<00:00:22.900> has<00:00:23.019> you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
have any special outputs it just has you

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.019 
have any special outputs it just has you
know<00:00:23.650> a<00:00:23.679> single<00:00:24.099> input<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.490> then<00:00:24.759> they<00:00:24.880> all

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
know a single input and then they all

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.849 
know a single input and then they all
output<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.779> same<00:00:25.960> power<00:00:26.230> so<00:00:26.470> it's<00:00:26.589> just<00:00:26.679> like

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
output the same power so it's just like

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.899 
output the same power so it's just like
a<00:00:26.890> big<00:00:27.039> splitter<00:00:27.460> this<00:00:28.329> one<00:00:28.570> has<00:00:28.829> your<00:00:29.909> battery

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
a big splitter this one has your battery

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.700 
a big splitter this one has your battery
inputs<00:00:31.240> over<00:00:31.359> here<00:00:31.570> you<00:00:31.689> plug<00:00:31.869> your<00:00:32.050> positive

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
inputs over here you plug your positive

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.350 
inputs over here you plug your positive
and<00:00:32.800> negative<00:00:32.860> onto<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.489> two<00:00:33.820> sides<00:00:34.090> here

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
and negative onto the two sides here

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.319 
and negative onto the two sides here
then<00:00:34.899> has<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.079> switch<00:00:35.469> switched<00:00:36.370> output<00:00:37.180> here

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
then has a switch switched output here

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.209 
then has a switch switched output here
for<00:00:37.539> LEDs<00:00:37.960> that's<00:00:38.289> connected<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.860> this<00:00:38.980> switch

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
for LEDs that's connected to this switch

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.760 
for LEDs that's connected to this switch
then<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.030> has<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.180> 12<00:00:40.660> volt<00:00:40.930> output<00:00:41.140> up<00:00:41.379> here<00:00:41.590> and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
then it has a 12 volt output up here and

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.680 
then it has a 12 volt output up here and
a<00:00:41.829> 5<00:00:42.100> volt<00:00:42.370> output<00:00:42.489> so<00:00:43.239> I'm<00:00:43.300> going<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.480> hook<00:00:43.539> up

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
a 5 volt output so I'm going to hook up

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.869 
a 5 volt output so I'm going to hook up
the<00:00:43.809> 3s<00:00:44.289> battery<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.770> this<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.129> 4s<00:00:45.489> battery

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
the 3s battery of this and a 4s battery

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.569 
the 3s battery of this and a 4s battery
to<00:00:46.059> this<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.390> we'll<00:00:46.480> see<00:00:46.510> if<00:00:46.719> those<00:00:47.579> outputs

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
to this and we'll see if those outputs

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.130 
to this and we'll see if those outputs
are<00:00:48.699> close<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.600> what<00:00:49.719> they<00:00:49.840> say<00:00:49.989> they're

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
are close to what they say they're

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.959 
are close to what they say they're
supposed<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.469> be<00:00:50.649> have<00:00:51.190> this<00:00:51.309> power<00:00:51.579> adapter

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
supposed to be have this power adapter

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.970 
supposed to be have this power adapter
soldered<00:00:52.359> on<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.629> here<00:00:52.840> now<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:53.289> I'm<00:00:53.769> going<00:00:53.859> to

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
soldered on to here now and I'm going to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.919 
soldered on to here now and I'm going to
go<00:00:54.070> ahead<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.280> attach<00:00:54.370> this<00:00:54.760> LED<00:00:55.269> strip<00:00:55.600> on<00:00:55.780> to

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
go ahead and attach this LED strip on to

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.220 
go ahead and attach this LED strip on to
the<00:00:56.050> LED<00:00:56.760> pins<00:00:57.760> there<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.269> then<00:00:58.690> we'll<00:00:58.840> hook

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
the LED pins there and then we'll hook

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.720 
the LED pins there and then we'll hook
up<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.559> some<00:00:59.739> power<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.129> see<00:01:00.280> what<00:01:00.370> happens

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
up to some power and see what happens

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.369 
up to some power and see what happens
here<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:01.000> have<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.239> LEDs<00:01:01.629> just<00:01:01.929> soldered<00:01:02.230> onto

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
here I have the LEDs just soldered onto

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.200 
here I have the LEDs just soldered onto
the<00:01:02.620> back<00:01:02.800> temporarily<00:01:03.070> just<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:03.789> we<00:01:03.879> can<00:01:04.000> see

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
the back temporarily just so we can see

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.120 
the back temporarily just so we can see
what<00:01:04.420> happens<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:05.050> I'm<00:01:05.800> going<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:05.980> go<00:01:06.070> ahead

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
what happens so I'm going to go ahead

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.850 
what happens so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:06.400> get<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.060> thing<00:01:07.300> plugged<00:01:08.110> into<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.470> 3s

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
and get this thing plugged into a 3s

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.140 
and get this thing plugged into a 3s
battery<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.430> well<00:01:09.520> hopefully<00:01:09.940> it'll

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
battery and well hopefully it'll

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.480 
battery and well hopefully it'll
hopefully<00:01:10.570> they<00:01:11.020> just<00:01:11.320> light<00:01:12.010> up<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.400> then

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
hopefully they just light up and then

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.430 
hopefully they just light up and then
we'll<00:01:12.640> start<00:01:12.880> doing<00:01:13.000> some<00:01:13.150> measurements<00:01:13.480> here

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
we'll start doing some measurements here

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.350 
we'll start doing some measurements here
it<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.650> I'm<00:01:14.860> going<00:01:15.070> I'm<00:01:15.760> going<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.030> connect<00:01:16.270> the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
it is I'm going I'm going to connect the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.750 
it is I'm going I'm going to connect the
3s<00:01:16.720> battery<00:01:17.170> good<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.980> LEDs<00:01:18.370> lit<00:01:18.580> up<00:01:18.700> like

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
3s battery good the LEDs lit up like

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.570 
3s battery good the LEDs lit up like
they're<00:01:19.030> supposed<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.680> let's<00:01:20.680> see<00:01:20.980> if<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.310> can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
they're supposed to let's see if we can

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.180 
they're supposed to let's see if we can
get<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.150> voltage<00:01:22.450> reading<00:01:22.990> off<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.320> this<00:01:26.190> coming

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
get a voltage reading off of this coming

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.540 
get a voltage reading off of this coming
in<00:01:27.310> at<00:01:27.520> 12.5<00:01:28.510> 3<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.740> that's<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.100> coming<00:01:30.340> in

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
in at 12.5 3 so that's just coming in

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.710 
in at 12.5 3 so that's just coming in
just<00:01:30.820> like<00:01:30.910> it's<00:01:31.090> supposed<00:01:31.360> to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
just like it's supposed to

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.070 
just like it's supposed to
with<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.640> battery<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:34.510> know<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:34.840> coming

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
with the battery you know just coming

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.140 
with the battery you know just coming
right<00:01:35.350> over<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:35.950> let's<00:01:36.550> see<00:01:36.670> if<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.850> switch

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
right over to it let's see if the switch

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.590 
right over to it let's see if the switch
works<00:01:37.390> oh<00:01:38.760> yeah<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.570> little<00:01:40.600> switch<00:01:40.990> works<00:01:42.600> so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
works oh yeah the little switch works so

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.870 
works oh yeah the little switch works so
the<00:01:43.870> switch<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.380> for<00:01:44.710> controlling<00:01:45.040> these<00:01:45.280> LED

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the switch is for controlling these LED

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.180 
the switch is for controlling these LED
connections<00:01:46.710> we're<00:01:47.710> going<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:47.920> leave<00:01:48.010> those
