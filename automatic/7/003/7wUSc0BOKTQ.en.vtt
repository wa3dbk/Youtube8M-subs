from publix it says its natural it has a
little<00:00:53.760> bit<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> salt<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.710> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
making your own because then you could

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.970 
making your own because then you could
always<00:00:59.100> eliminate<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.850> extra<00:01:00.329> salt<00:01:00.980> but
