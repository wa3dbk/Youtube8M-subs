00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
between my swing and the avatars swing I
put<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> develop<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> choice<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
put this down to develop a choice you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
put this down to develop a choice you
take<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.090> eyes<00:01:39.210> off<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> action<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> swing

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
take your eyes off the action to swing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990 
take your eyes off the action to swing
so<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> game<00:01:40.860> gives<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> time<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> look<00:01:41.759> back
