00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 the challenge of today in chicago 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.230
 is creating websites around the world 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.029
 brazilian version w3c são paulo distante 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 of my house only 7 thousand 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 Chicago is the third largest 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 city ​​of the united states with 2.7 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.759
 millions of inhabitants 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 pioneer in the construction of skyscrapers 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.450
 chicago concentrates some of the largest 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.690
 buildings in the world as they 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 such is this 108-story giant and 520 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.810
 meters high became the most 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 building in the world for 24 years 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:50.270
 wow this building really is very tall 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.190
 soul gum is giving me vertigo 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.500
 despite being a chicago metropolis 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 has a unique quality of life 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.130
 where we can ride your bike 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 Beautiful bike paths by the lake 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.559
 michigan to take a boat ride in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.430
 cross the city or simply walk 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 on foot 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.810
 admiring the lentíssimos parks 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.580
 famous monuments and beautiful architecture 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.800
 of its buildings in 1871 all this part 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.229
 the city caught fire and in his 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.940
 reconstruction architects took advantage of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.050
 and lavish creativity 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.700
 the result was the face of São Paulo in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.520
 chicago also found one of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.120
 the world's busiest airports. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.220
 hair international airport a giant 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.500
 with seven lanes for landing and takeoff 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.570
 five terminals and 70 million 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 passengers per year in a city with 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.750
 many beautiful examples of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 architecture, I imagine that the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.700
 main airport in the city ​​as well 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.670
 Nothing is beautiful there. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 looks is that there is CEPEA site 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 the aviation department of chicago in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.720
 reality the king does not have a website 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.360
 Exclusive to enter the real dot com 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.490
 we are redirected to the cbda website 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.630
 which controls the two largest airports 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.990
 of the city 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.759
 hair and homicide on one more site 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 stopped in time that seems to have been 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.959
 made more than ten years ago 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.510
 here are some problems first 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.530
 cda logo that is hidden there in the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.540
 right corner 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.340
 It is not immediately clear that there is 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.110
 here the pages about the hair I donated 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.600
 that stay here 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.640
 small menu links in times of 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.710
 tablets and smartphones where we are 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.290
 navigating more with a finger than 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.240
 with small cursor links like 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 They are not at all friendly. 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.970
 this news title a fingerprint I get 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.280
 two links at once complicated, right? 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.680
 the idea is to recreate this site thinking not 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.300
 only in navigation based on the cursor of the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.640
 mouse over using your finger too 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.810
 I would like to highlight the two main 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.870
 site items 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.150
 the airports and make the links both the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.070
 menu as one of the most friendly texts 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.170
 for navigation with your fingers 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.760
 you need to increase buttons 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.230
 texts and group news from a 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.150
 so that they are small rectangles 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.300
 easy to click with your finger 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.270
 so come on there will be fire works screen 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.709
 make a 1920's by 1080 screen and I'll 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.520
 work within a thousand space 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.230
 pixels 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.510
 you must first set the site 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.340
 we are talking about airplanes just imagine 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.810
 a stump with a little piece of heaven 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.330
 I'll put this image with background 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.760
 then to obfuscate the other elements 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.920
 make a rectangle with radial gradient 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.560
 from white to transparent to give 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.180
 this effect defends rounded placement 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.010
 then cepea logo 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.299
 you have to put it back 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.820
 aviation department of chicago 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.280
 as the site tuaw because in the logo 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.530
 You find such information as the site 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.810
 encompasses two airports to highlight 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.310
 the way to get to the pages 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.590
 these airports 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.150
 so he created two large buttons for 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.459
 each airport to comply with two 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.260
 goals to highlight right away where 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.620
 click to have information of each 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.190
 airport and 2 make it very easy to click 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.750
 for who is navigating with the little finger 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.580
 below it places a blue bar following the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.040
 font color pattern in fonts 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.140
 relatively large places each item 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.060
 menu also places a search on a 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.060
 and big box for easy click 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.549
 for those who use tablets it's time to 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.500
 do the search for flights as we have two 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.450
 large buttons on the right side places 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 this box on the left to do 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.620
 a counterpoint places boxes and buttons 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.410
 also great for facilitating the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.140
 mid-way navigation to and from 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.599
 I think of putting something in the background that 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.270
 connect website to owerri airport 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.320
 then places a photo used as if 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.360
 was scribbled showing the shape 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.670
 the airport tower puts a mark 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.770
 very clear water so as not to disturb 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.350
 the content but even being a brand 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.920
 of the water keeps the visible traces of the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.750
 tower 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.580
 playing to the right side to not 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.320
 stay below content 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.150
 I still put a photo called 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.670
 content I 'll work on it already 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.710
 under the search I put the news and 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.260
 information such as the current page but 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.180
 in a more compact way I understand 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.820
 two positive points a better space 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.590
 and click facilitation. 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.660
 since it is easier to touch your fingers in a 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.180
 news item with four lines forming a 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.190
 box than just a news line 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.740
 on the right hand side, it 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.750
 time information service are 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.330
 relevant for airports proof below 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.640
 the parking lot status three of 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.410
 traffic to the airport go back to the 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.330
 photo of the top and places the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.950
 Ciccone airport information that 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.620
 keep as in the current page 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.460
 I end with the footer menu in my 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.850
 signature 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.100
 ready is there looks there is this look 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.160
 sincere is not my dear friend be 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.230
 sincere which layout is the best 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.170
 layout is more organized easier 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.980
 to navigate more current 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.960
 hey the brat not chinese layouts in the 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.810
 we worry not only with users of 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.880
 desktops and laptops but also with the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.190
 browsing tablet users 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.110
 using the touch of the fingers so the 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.420
 fonts and large buttons to 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.700
 this audience is a beautiful one using 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.450
 shapes basic fonts colors and few 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.580
 images 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.680
 a good example of how you can do 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.980
 a professional layout employing only 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.740
 basic design techniques and there is 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.430
 therefore fulfilling my purpose and I 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.430
 I am 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.310
 any being analyzed by me the brunão 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.410
 to learn more design techniques 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.300
 I know the design course is well courses 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.760
 blah blah dot com.br 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.500
 I'm waiting for you there now that I'm 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.330
 happy with the mission accomplished 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.670
 I'm jumping around joyfully and 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.620
 bouncing on lakeside michigan 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.380
 we are in the next challenge 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.380
 of recreating the sites the world there
