00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.790
 the steel man the movie based on 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 superman follows a bit the wake of the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.360
 batman trilogy or rather the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.650
 dark knight and it's a great movie 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.599
 despite what he says in many 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.480
 critical but good now I do not want 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.439
 do a review and I will do a review 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.660
 probably one of these days is the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.430
 area 1 today I wanted to talk about a topic 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.550
 that a lot of people were interested 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.950
 we know that marvel superheroes 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 they follow a joint history the universe 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.579
 set everything all the movies of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 marvel fernÃ¡ndez departing belong to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.940
 the same land so to speak and then 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 many of them came out in a movie 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 joint of the avengers to me 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.400
 I personally did not like the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 Avengers were the story a little 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.940
 simpleton and after seeing the man of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.790
 steel is very short in terms of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 destruction and special effects but 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.150
 well I do not want to enter a spoiler or anything 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.850
 about the movie and seeing it is a 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.070
 very good movie and what was 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.810
 saying that a lot of people thought that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.890
 since they have done the batman trilogy 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.020
 recently and in this first movie of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.299
 Superman left the producer who has 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 created the batman trilogy many 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.850
 they thought he wanted the same now what 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 same with the league of justice 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.200
 and that in this world we will see all the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.430
 top of tc together for now 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.220
 we have the green lantern movie 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.119
 that has been mec and we have the great 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.369
 Batman trilogy 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.110
 well many people expected to see 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.970
 some batman in this new movie 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.659
 of the steel man in the movie of 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.890
 superman and there is one thing a lot of people 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.539
 you have not seen it in fact I have not seen 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.450
 this then I started looking for it in 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.860
 internet so right now I os os 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.780
 I confirm that yes there is one thing in the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.520
 movie if you have not seen it from 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.049
 I increase the movie or you do not have not 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.450
 You have realized that thing you 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.270
 I recommend pausing the video and you know the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.460
 again to the cinema and try to find it 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.409
 because if you do not lose the grace if you do not 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.840
 continue this video well because in 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 literally 5 seconds I will teach you 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.950
 where is button 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.890
 what is little you will say in the last 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.599
 scene where there is a fight between the two 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.190
 the hero and the villain you can not put 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.930
 weapons but almost the end of the movie 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.180
 superman crashes into a satellite that 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.660
 is in Earth orbit obviously 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.190
 as you can see there is a w there is worth 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.510
 little thing the quality of the image is very 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.209
 bad because at the moment we have it 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.370
 dvd version nio blu-ray or anything but it 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.250
 see clearly that the symbol is that of 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.030
 wayne industris wayne wayne enterprises 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.760
 rather and that's basically the company 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.440
 from bruce wayne or put the family way 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 rather who as we all know 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.989
 batman and apart from the w you can 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.120
 visualize a few letters a little 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.250
 of wayne so it is one hundred percent 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.680
 confirmed that that jumps and belongs to you 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.299
 to the batman company of Wayne and for 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.670
 So much is one hundred percent confirmed 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.010
 that batman exists in this universe 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.840
 apart some references to the company 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.670
 of lex luthor that obviously yes that 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.160
 has to exist because he exploded is 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.970
 of the superman universe and therefore of the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.980
 dc universe too 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.160
 and apparently they are setting up a 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.870
 little the roll so that in the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.730
 next movie or the next one to that 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.620
 go out to explode as one of the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.990
 villains but good that 's a subject 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.330
 Quite apart and you see what comes out 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.600
 several times lex luthor but I guess that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.690
 for all the fans of the cdc saga yo 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.920
 I am an incredible fan of the tc I love 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.890
 dc I loved everything that has to do 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.480
 with dc much more than with marvel for 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.520
 all of us has been discovering 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.770
 pretty interesting discovery this 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.800
 that they have put an interest on 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.670
 wayne enterprises because I would 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.510
 I was waiting but I have not seen it 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.070
 unfortunately because I am a little bit I am 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.510
 a little distracted from those things I never 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.180
 I realize what ex-sister sometimes 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.350
 yes and nothing thanks to the internet we can 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.030
 have this information 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.620
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.080
 interest as I said in the next 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.970
 days maybe you see one I do not know if one 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.070
 review or rather personal opinions 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.870
 mine in plan videoblog about the movie 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.280
 I tell you that I loved it and 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.070
 I recommend everyone to go see her 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.240
 because it's a movie piece and nothing 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.620
 I hope you like the video as 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.080
