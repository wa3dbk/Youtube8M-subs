are watching this now there have been

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
are watching this now there have been
some<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> positional<00:00:55.230> collection<00:00:55.680> cards

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
some of the positional collection cards

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
some of the positional collection cards
that<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:57.180> surpassed<00:00:57.600> these<00:00:57.930> ones<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.620> at

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
that have surpassed these ones but at

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.970 
that have surpassed these ones but at
the<00:00:59.460> time<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.090> played<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.710> about

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the time that we played this was about

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.080 
the time that we played this was about
the<00:01:02.219> best<00:01:02.370> team<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.059> possibly

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the best team that you could possibly

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.479 
the best team that you could possibly
create<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.229> after<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> game<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
create in this game after the game I

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
create in this game after the game I
actually<00:01:05.760> went<00:01:06.000> back<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.750> calculated

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
actually went back and just calculated

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually went back and just calculated
the<00:01:07.710> cost<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.330> been<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the cost that it would have been to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.920 
the cost that it would have been to
build<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> team<00:01:10.760> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> current<00:01:12.270> time<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
build this team at the current time I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.870 
build this team at the current time I
think<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.710> calculated<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
think we calculated that it was

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.350 
think we calculated that it was
something<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.689> 4.2<00:01:16.560> million<00:01:16.950> coins<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
something like 4.2 million coins to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.749 
something like 4.2 million coins to
build<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.720> team<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.770> anyways<00:01:20.400> we'll<00:01:20.610> see

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
build this team so anyways we'll see

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
build this team so anyways we'll see
what<00:01:20.880> happens<00:01:21.049> opening<00:01:22.049> kickoff<00:01:22.380> he<00:01:22.680> boots<00:01:22.950> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
what happens opening kickoff he boots it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340
