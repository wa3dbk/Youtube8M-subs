it may seem a bit odd that this reaction

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.830 
it may seem a bit odd that this reaction
requires<00:03:01.220> ATP<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> primary

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
requires ATP and one of the primary

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.230 
requires ATP and one of the primary
roles<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.380> calluses<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.520> ATP<00:03:06.060> for

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
roles of my calluses is to make ATP for

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
enosis makes more ATP than it uses but

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.860

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.310 
the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction
is<00:04:31.470> an<00:04:32.250> isomerase<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.150> we<00:04:33.750> won't<00:04:33.960> say<00:04:34.139> any

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.770 
more about it here the third step in
glycolysis<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.490> conversion<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:39.120> fructose

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
glycolysis is the conversion of fructose

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.360 
glycolysis is the conversion of fructose
6-phosphate<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.800> fructose<00:04:41.310> 1<00:04:42.090> 6<00:04:42.150> bisphosphate

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
6-phosphate to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.920 
6-phosphate to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate
by<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.430> addition<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.030> another<00:04:45.180> phosphate

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
by the addition of another phosphate

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.280 
by the addition of another phosphate
group<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:47.340> let's<00:04:47.490> go<00:04:47.639> through<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.940> steps<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
group so let's go through the steps the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.920 
group so let's go through the steps the
substrates<00:04:49.800> are<00:04:50.100> fructose<00:04:50.910> 6-phosphate<00:04:51.360> and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
substrates are fructose 6-phosphate and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.600 
substrates are fructose 6-phosphate and
again<00:04:52.770> ATP<00:04:53.580> as<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.330> source<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.870> phosphate

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
again ATP as the source of the phosphate

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.340 
again ATP as the source of the phosphate
so<00:04:56.610> this<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.000> second<00:04:57.389> time<00:04:57.600> we're<00:04:58.200> using

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:56.379 
each other a concept we came across in

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:58.980 
each other a concept we came across in
an<00:06:56.499> earlier<00:06:56.740> slide<00:06:56.919> and<00:06:57.449> so<00:06:58.449> they<00:06:58.719> can<00:06:58.869> be

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
an earlier slide and so they can be

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.519 
an earlier slide and so they can be
interconverted<00:06:59.580> one<00:07:00.580> to<00:07:00.759> the<00:07:00.849> other

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:01.529 
interconverted one to the other

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.950 
interconverted one to the other
