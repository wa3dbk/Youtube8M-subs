been in and around this field for so
long<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.329> her<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:57.750> rallied<00:00:58.379> around

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
long all of her people rallied around

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.130 
long all of her people rallied around
her<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> research<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.420> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
her with all of the research and so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
her with all of the research and so
they've<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.980> largely<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.640> credit<00:01:03.090> fish<00:01:03.329> oil

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
they've really largely a credit fish oil

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.200 
they've really largely a credit fish oil
to<00:01:03.899> pulling<00:01:04.530> him<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> coma<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.880> fast

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to pulling him out of a coma now we fast

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
to pulling him out of a coma now we fast
forward<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.630> year<00:01:06.659> later<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.439> he's<00:01:07.770> living<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
forward a year later and he's living a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
forward a year later and he's living a
normal<00:01:08.460> life<00:01:08.700> oh<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.630> goodness

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
normal life oh my goodness

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
normal life oh my goodness
so<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:11.340> fish<00:01:11.729> oil<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> heard<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> Barry

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so with fish oil have you heard of Barry

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
so with fish oil have you heard of Barry
Sears<00:01:13.380> he's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.130> popular<00:01:14.400> integrative

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
Sears he's a very popular integrative

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
Sears he's a very popular integrative
medical<00:01:15.600> doctor<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.009> he's<00:01:17.189> done<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
medical doctor and so and he's done a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
medical doctor and so and he's done a
lot<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.759> research<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.360> fish<00:01:18.750> oil<00:01:19.020> or

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
lot of research because fish oil or

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
lot of research because fish oil or
fatty<00:01:19.650> acids<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.490> 30%<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.210> our<00:01:21.299> brains

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
fatty acids make up 30% of our brains

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
fatty acids make up 30% of our brains
and<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> coma<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and so if you're in a coma and you have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
and so if you're in a coma and you have
brain<00:01:24.360> swelling<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.990> goes<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.530> strokes<00:01:26.369> as

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
brain swelling this goes for strokes as

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
brain swelling this goes for strokes as
well<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.390> goes<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.990> MS<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.799> goes<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.250> any

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
well this goes for MS this goes for any

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.030 
well this goes for MS this goes for any
type<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.670> brain<00:01:30.479> injury<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.200> altitude

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
type of brain injury even altitude

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.539 
type of brain injury even altitude
sickness

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
sickness

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
sickness
you<00:01:33.119> need<00:01:33.390> these<00:01:33.689> omega-3<00:01:34.409> fatty<00:01:34.619> acids<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you need these omega-3 fatty acids and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
you need these omega-3 fatty acids and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
he all of them had brain damage and the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
he all of them had brain damage and the

so<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.350> research<00:01:49.710> comes<00:01:50.040> full<00:01:50.610> circle<00:01:51.170> now

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so this research comes full circle now

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.760 
so this research comes full circle now
last<00:01:52.680> year<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:54.450> started<00:01:54.930> giving<00:01:55.140> grants

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
last year and they started giving grants

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.310 
last year and they started giving grants
the<00:01:56.159> victim<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:57.210> started<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.750> giving<00:01:58.200> him

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the victim they started in giving him

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200 
the victim they started in giving him
through<00:01:58.500> his<00:01:58.619> feeding<00:01:58.890> tube<00:01:58.979> 20<00:01:59.670> grams<00:01:59.939> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
through his feeding tube 20 grams of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
through his feeding tube 20 grams of
fish<00:02:00.450> oil<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.840> day<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.770> would<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.070> 40

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
fish oil a day so that would be like 40

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
fish oil a day so that would be like 40
of<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:02.939> pills<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.509> day<00:02:03.540> through<00:02:04.140> his<00:02:04.320> feeding

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
of these pills a day through his feeding

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.730 
of these pills a day through his feeding
tube<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.219> within<00:02:05.729> two<00:02:06.119> days<00:02:06.229> Erica<00:02:07.259> he<00:02:07.500> was

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
tube and within two days Erica he was

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
tube and within two days Erica he was
able<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> call<00:02:08.429> his<00:02:08.729> mom<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.209> he<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:09.450> able<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
able to call his mom and he was able to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.650 
able to call his mom and he was able to
speak<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.349> fish<00:02:10.649> oil<00:02:10.950> helps<00:02:11.270> keeps<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.450> brain

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
speak so fish oil helps keeps your brain

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.520 
speak so fish oil helps keeps your brain
from<00:02:12.959> swelling

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
from swelling

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
from swelling
it<00:02:13.680> helps<00:02:13.920> prevent<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:14.640> slows<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.090> yes

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it helps prevent that or slows that yes

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.600 
it helps prevent that or slows that yes
so<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.590> bump<00:02:16.890> your<00:02:17.100> knee<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.459> it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
so if you if you bump your knee and it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.910 
so if you if you bump your knee and it
swells<00:02:17.970> that's<00:02:18.569> inflammation<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.620> body's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
swells that's inflammation is the body's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
swells that's inflammation is the body's
body's<00:02:20.610> reaction<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> injury<00:02:21.569> if<00:02:21.750> that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
body's reaction to injury if that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.530 
body's reaction to injury if that
happens<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.860> brain<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.360> could

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
happens in the brain that is that could

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.280 
happens in the brain that is that could
be<00:02:24.660> fatal

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
be fatal

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.840 
be fatal
or<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.740> could<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:25.920> long-lasting<00:02:26.640> where<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
or that could be long-lasting where you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.699 
or that could be long-lasting where you
can<00:02:27.000> never<00:02:27.120> speak<00:02:27.540> again<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.470> why<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
can never speak again do we know why the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.470 
can never speak again do we know why the
official<00:02:29.160> does<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.640> exactly<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:30.300> know

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
official does that exactly do we know

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.890 
official does that exactly do we know
because<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.440> all<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.010> high<00:02:32.310> powered

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
because of all the high powered

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.600 
because of all the high powered
anti-inflammatory<00:02:33.900> compounds<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.739> if<00:02:35.340> your

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
anti-inflammatory compounds and if your

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.840 
anti-inflammatory compounds and if your
brain<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:35.910> made<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.720> fatty<00:02:37.530> acids<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.310> then

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
brain is made of fatty acids and then

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.330 
brain is made of fatty acids and then
it's<00:02:39.030> damaged<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.750> give<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.410> fatty<00:02:40.770> acids

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's damaged and you give it fatty acids

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.550 
it's damaged and you give it fatty acids
it<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.670> start<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.120> regenerate<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it can start to regenerate so you the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.500 
it can start to regenerate so you the
swelling<00:02:44.040> starts<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.580> shrink<00:02:44.819> considerably

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
swelling starts to shrink considerably

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.930 
swelling starts to shrink considerably
but<00:02:45.959> then<00:02:46.110> also<00:02:46.260> regeneration<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.459> happen

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
but then also regeneration can happen

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.270 
but then also regeneration can happen
okay<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> protects<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> protects<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
okay it protects it protects so the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.590 
okay it protects it protects so the
neuro<00:02:50.459> chemical<00:02:50.970> messengers<00:02:51.390> can

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
neuro chemical messengers can

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.660 
neuro chemical messengers can
communicate<00:02:52.200> interesting<00:02:52.890> yeah<00:02:53.100> let's<00:02:53.580> talk

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
communicate interesting yeah let's talk

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.850 
communicate interesting yeah let's talk
about<00:02:53.820> who<00:02:54.150> should<00:02:54.690> take<00:02:54.840> fish<00:02:55.320> oil<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
about who should take fish oil on a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.500 
about who should take fish oil on a
regular<00:02:56.250> basis<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.910> how<00:02:57.000> do<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.330> how

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
regular basis and how do you know how

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.110 
regular basis and how do you know how
much<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.900> take<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.500> how<00:02:58.650> frequently<00:02:59.190> sure<00:02:59.940> on

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
much to take and how frequently sure on

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.150 
much to take and how frequently sure on
a<00:03:00.150> regular<00:03:00.690> basis<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.319> would<00:03:01.380> suggest<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:02.130> a

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
a regular basis I would suggest about a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.979 
a regular basis I would suggest about a
thousand<00:03:02.700> milligrams<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.330> day<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.840> as

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
thousand milligrams a day just as

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.440 
thousand milligrams a day just as
general<00:03:04.500> Maine<00:03:04.709> which<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.430> which<00:03:05.850> if

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
general Maine which is what which if

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.059 
general Maine which is what which if
you're<00:03:06.630> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> take<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.290> barlines<00:03:07.650> fish

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you're going to take the barlines fish

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.610 
you're going to take the barlines fish
oil<00:03:08.310> then<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.150> would<00:03:09.300> be<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.720> take<00:03:09.750> two<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
oil then that would be to take two to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.590 
oil then that would be to take two to
three<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.950> day<00:03:11.220> two<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.790> three<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.030> these<00:03:12.180> two<00:03:12.360> to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
three a day two to three of these two to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.570 
three a day two to three of these two to
three<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.900> those<00:03:13.140> pills<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.650> day<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
three of those pills a day and do you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.520 
three of those pills a day and do you
notice<00:03:14.850> Erica<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.510> these<00:03:15.660> are<00:03:15.840> darker<00:03:16.260> color

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
notice Erica that these are darker color

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.979 
notice Erica that these are darker color
than<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.950> usually<00:03:17.130> see<00:03:17.579> right<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.450> want<00:03:18.870> to

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
than you usually see right you want to

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.080 
than you usually see right you want to
look<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.470> fish<00:03:19.709> oil<00:03:19.950> that's<00:03:20.220> darker<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.760> color

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
look for fish oil that's darker in color

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.180 
look for fish oil that's darker in color
because<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.110> one<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.440> looked<00:03:22.680> very<00:03:22.739> pale

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
because the one that looked very pale

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.670 
because the one that looked very pale
yellow<00:03:23.220> there's<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.269> lot<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.570> toxicity<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.410> fish

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
yellow there's a lot of toxicity in fish

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.140 
yellow there's a lot of toxicity in fish
oil<00:03:25.860> where<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.280> hear<00:03:26.519> there's<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.910> lot<00:03:26.940> of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
oil where you hear there's a lot of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.240 
oil where you hear there's a lot of
metals<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.720> them<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.860> means<00:03:29.070> that

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
metals in them and so that means that

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.940 
nervous system cinnamon is fantastic now
I<00:05:08.490> suggest<00:05:08.970> everybody<00:05:09.630> put<00:05:10.229> cinnamon<00:05:10.560> in

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
I suggest everybody put cinnamon in

I suggest everybody put cinnamon in
their<00:05:11.130> coffee<00:05:11.160> in<00:05:11.760> their<00:05:12.000> smoothies<00:05:12.479> and

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
their coffee in their smoothies and

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.590 
their coffee in their smoothies and
however<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.530> can<00:05:13.740> get<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.010> okay<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.700> so<00:05:15.240> when

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
however you can get it okay and so when

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.300 
however you can get it okay and so when
they<00:05:15.810> were<00:05:16.139> doing<00:05:16.169> research<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:16.950> stroke

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
they were doing research on stroke

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.850 
they were doing research on stroke
victims<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.180> basically<00:05:19.110> if<00:05:19.350> you<00:05:19.530> have<00:05:19.830> a

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
victims and basically if you have a

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.250 
victims and basically if you have a
stroke<00:05:20.280> oxygen<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.210> cut<00:05:21.419> off<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.780> brain

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
stroke oxygen is cut off to the brain

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.110 
stroke oxygen is cut off to the brain
glucose<00:05:22.680> you're<00:05:22.979> starving<00:05:23.460> your<00:05:23.639> brain<00:05:23.850> cells

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
glucose you're starving your brain cells

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.450 
glucose you're starving your brain cells
very<00:05:24.510> very<00:05:24.870> quickly<00:05:25.260> yes<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:25.949> so<00:05:26.100> they<00:05:26.220> had<00:05:26.430> a

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
very very quickly yes and so they had a

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.969 
very very quickly yes and so they had a
control<00:05:27.120> group<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.690> they<00:05:28.320> were<00:05:28.380> watching

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
control group and they were watching

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.950 
control group and they were watching
that<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:29.400> decline<00:05:29.760> in<00:05:30.060> brain<00:05:30.330> cells<00:05:30.600> and

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
that this decline in brain cells and

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.750 
that this decline in brain cells and
then<00:05:31.470> with<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.860> experiment<00:05:32.400> group<00:05:32.520> they

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
then with the experiment group they

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.469 
then with the experiment group they
added<00:05:33.240> cinnamon<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:34.470> they<00:05:34.860> had<00:05:35.039> a<00:05:35.479> 40%

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
added cinnamon to it and they had a 40%

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.290 
added cinnamon to it and they had a 40%
slower<00:05:36.960> decline<00:05:37.889> in<00:05:38.070> brain<00:05:38.220> cells<00:05:38.610> Wow<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.180> it

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
slower decline in brain cells Wow so it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.790 
slower decline in brain cells Wow so it
shows<00:05:39.510> that<00:05:39.720> cinnamon<00:05:40.169> can<00:05:40.320> really<00:05:40.560> protect

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
shows that cinnamon can really protect

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.040 
shows that cinnamon can really protect
us<00:05:41.190> any<00:05:41.490> type<00:05:41.729> of<00:05:41.760> cinnamon<00:05:42.330> that's<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.960> we

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
here and then other things that protect

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.440 
here and then other things that protect
the<00:05:55.050> brain<00:05:55.260> so<00:05:55.800> for<00:05:56.070> brain<00:05:56.310> swelling<00:05:57.180> if<00:05:57.330> you

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
the brain so for brain swelling if you

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.140 
the brain so for brain swelling if you
have<00:05:57.630> sinus<00:05:58.080> infections<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.919> have

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
have sinus infections you have

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
of walnuts a day doesn't even have to be

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.950 
of walnuts a day doesn't even have to be
every<00:06:11.789> day<00:06:11.910> it<00:06:12.000> could<00:06:12.120> be<00:06:12.180> three<00:06:12.479> times<00:06:12.720> a<00:06:12.840> week

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
every day it could be three times a week

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.100 
every day it could be three times a week
and<00:06:13.200> then<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.560> then<00:06:14.039> olive<00:06:14.639> oil<00:06:14.849> is<00:06:15.180> fantastic

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
and then and then olive oil is fantastic

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.779 
and then and then olive oil is fantastic
and<00:06:16.380> if<00:06:16.590> your<00:06:16.740> health<00:06:17.010> and<00:06:17.250> for<00:06:17.400> your<00:06:17.550> brain

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
and if your health and for your brain

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.779 
and if your health and for your brain
and<00:06:18.120> so<00:06:18.510> is<00:06:18.630> avocado<00:06:18.930> oil<00:06:19.440> that's<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:20.490> good<00:06:20.669> one

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
and so is avocado oil that's a good one

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.339 
and so is avocado oil that's a good one
to<00:06:21.000> cook<00:06:21.270> with<00:06:21.450> because<00:06:21.870> it<00:06:21.990> has<00:06:22.020> a<00:06:22.110> high<00:06:22.320> smoke

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
to cook with because it has a high smoke

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.469 
to cook with because it has a high smoke
point<00:06:22.710> it's<00:06:23.070> actually<00:06:23.190> better<00:06:23.610> to<00:06:23.789> cook<00:06:24.270> with

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
point it's actually better to cook with

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.490 
point it's actually better to cook with
an<00:06:24.690> olive<00:06:24.930> oil

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500
