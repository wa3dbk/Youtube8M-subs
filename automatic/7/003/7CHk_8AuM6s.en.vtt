00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.920
Hi I'm Tom Purvis. For years you've seen
me tell you how to get in great shape

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.960
with Bowflex home gyms.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.860
Well now I have another secret to share
with you: with Bowflex you can get fast

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.380
results with just the turn of a dial,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.520
thanks to the Bowflex SelectTech free
weight system. The Bowflex SelectTech

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.380
unique weight system lets you go from
five pounds to fifty two and a half pounds

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.980
quickly, easily, and safely. And this is
what makes this product so terrific. For

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.400
years dumbbells have always made for
great workout, but they've always

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.200
presented a huge logistical problem. I
mean you'd have to have nearly two walls

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.980
lined with dumbbells to get the same number of free weights that you do in just one

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.990
pair SelectTech dumbbells. SelectTech
takes up one tenth of the space of

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
normal free weights and at half the normal price.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.890
That's precisely the kind of innovation
you'd expect from Bowflex.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.090
We've taken a great tool for working out
and just made it practical for the home.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.130
The secret is the patented locking
mechanism that seeks and locks

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.540
only the weight you select. It works just
like a safe

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.770
except you always know the combination. Just rotate the dial to the weight you want and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.670
bam

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.620
SelectTech tumblers automatically fasten to the weight you want to lift. You want to lift 15

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.570
pounds? No problem, just set the dial to 15 and lift. It's just that quick.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.610
You want a bigger challenge, say 40
pounds? Move the dials to 40 and lift.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.630
It's just that quick. You want even
fifty two and a half pounds? No problem,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.220
just dial and lift. And for added safety

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.140
our engineers have created a spring-loaded locking pin that prevents the knob from

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.750
rotating when you lift SelectTech from
its base.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.420
So you never have to worry about
dropping plates like you can with

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.250
old-fashioned dumbbells.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.670
This innovative design allows us to
shrink

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.560
30 separate dumbbells down to two,
saving you a lot of space and a ton of

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.690
money. But here's the key

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.340
no matter what weight you choose, you won't get the results you crave unless you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.620
perform each exercise correctly.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.269
A huge part of success in working with
dumbbells is based in technique. And

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.110
that's why I'm going to show you how to
do each rep properly and demonstrate on

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.790
more than 30 basic exercises including
over 80 variations that you can do with

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.090
this equipment.
