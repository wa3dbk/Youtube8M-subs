00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.190

 do not 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.949
 [Music] 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.270
 with all my friends 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.130
 opened a woman for boy who had 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.580
 because we see 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.130
 and the truth is that he was many years old 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.850
 and 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.300
 [Music] 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 wheels 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.720
 [Music] 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.720
 with this code 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 yes 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.610
 the density I think my mind 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.610
 [Music] 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.870
 it's the only thing that arrives to do this 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.600
 but I want 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.310
 but the face list 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:26.420
 [Music] 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:29.959
 whatever 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.959
 [Music] 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.350
 but he says no 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.350
 this pastor know each other 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.900
 [Music] 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.700
 people 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.619
 [Music] 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.159
 for the truth you told I could 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.040
 buy the crap company why 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.250
 the allowed 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.250
 l 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.650
 since we are 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.160
 but let's say the humor that is 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.650
 regarding the store and the study of 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.240
 lifetime 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.240
 many criticize it 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.120
 I want more
