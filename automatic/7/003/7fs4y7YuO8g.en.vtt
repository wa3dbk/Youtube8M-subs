00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
aerosol because I like the way it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.469 
aerosol because I like the way it
spreads<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.439> opposed<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.149> has

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
spreads more as opposed to one that has

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810 
spreads more as opposed to one that has
just<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.869> normal<00:01:40.229> spritz<00:01:40.890> spray<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.580> leaves

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
just a normal spritz spray that leaves

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
just a normal spritz spray that leaves
the<00:01:41.970> hair<00:01:42.149> feeling<00:01:42.420> wet<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.080> will<00:01:43.380> spray<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the hair feeling wet I will spray and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.450 
the hair feeling wet I will spray and
then<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.119> will<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.750> over<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.530> areas<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
then I will go over the areas just to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
then I will go over the areas just to
tuck<00:01:47.789> in<00:01:48.030> any<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> stray<00:01:49.229> hairs<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.830> I'm
