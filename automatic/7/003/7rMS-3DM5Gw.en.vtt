america new fractional technology for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.990 
america new fractional technology for
non-surgical<00:00:48.570> facelift<00:00:48.899> thing<00:00:49.680> that's<00:00:50.670> great

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
non-surgical facelift thing that's great

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
non-surgical facelift thing that's great
because<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> lot<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> people<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:51.989> afraid<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
instant results how fast does it work

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.170 
instant results how fast does it work
okay<00:00:58.649> well<00:00:58.980> you'll<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.399> yourself<00:00:59.760> probably

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
okay well you'll see yourself probably

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.389 
okay well you'll see yourself probably
in<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.870> week's<00:01:01.230> time<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> best<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
in about a week's time but the best is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.210 
in about a week's time but the best is
four<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> six<00:01:03.750> weeks<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.010> nice<00:01:05.189> thing

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
four to six weeks and the nice thing

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.810 
four to six weeks and the nice thing
about<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.260> used<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.619> topical<00:01:08.610> numbing

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
about this is used as topical numbing

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.170 
about this is used as topical numbing
and<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.930> basically<00:01:10.500> no<00:01:10.950> downtime<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.939> no

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
wound this is a very unique technology

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
wound this is a very unique technology
that<00:01:19.680> bypassed<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> surface<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.240> skin

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that bypassed the surface of the skin

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
that bypassed the surface of the skin
goes<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> dermis<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.670> cause<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
goes right in the dermis the cause that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.330 
goes right in the dermis the cause that
changes<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> remodeling<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> College<00:01:26.189> of

changes the remodeling of the College of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
changes the remodeling of the College of
tightening<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> skin<00:01:27.390> lifting<00:01:27.930> reduce<00:01:28.710> pore

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
tightening the skin lifting reduce pore

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.179 
tightening the skin lifting reduce pore
size<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.579> remove<00:01:30.270> scars<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> incredible

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
size and remove scars that is incredible

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.100 
size and remove scars that is incredible
and<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> lasts<00:01:33.030> about<00:01:33.180> yeah<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.840> actually

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and it lasts about yeah well actually

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.880 
and it lasts about yeah well actually
the<00:01:34.409> changes<00:01:35.400> induces<00:01:36.030> permanent<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the changes induces permanent so the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.109 
the changes induces permanent so the
changes<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.369> permanent<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> very

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
changes are permanent so it's a very

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.200 
changes are permanent so it's a very
long<00:01:39.570> lasting<00:01:39.990> procedure<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.909> very

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
long lasting procedure it's a very

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.660 
long lasting procedure it's a very
intensive<00:01:42.899> okay<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.590> show<00:01:43.890> us<00:01:44.070> how<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.250> going

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
intensive okay so show us how it's going

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
intensive okay so show us how it's going
to<00:01:44.729> work<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.420> would<00:01:45.720> anything<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
to work so you would anything like this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
to work so you would anything like this
so<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> machine<00:01:47.880> yes<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
so this is the machine yes this is the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.100 
so this is the machine yes this is the
handpiece<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.490> comes<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.540> head<00:01:52.079> like

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
handpiece and it comes with a head like

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.760 
handpiece and it comes with a head like
this<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.270> inside<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.740> are

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this and inside it is there they are

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.520 
this and inside it is there they are
micro<00:01:56.579> needles<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> barely<00:01:57.630> penetrate

push the foot pedal there

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.770 
push the foot pedal there
the<00:02:12.060> energy<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.540> being<00:02:12.720> released<00:02:12.959> into<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
the energy is being released into the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.559 
the energy is being released into the
dermis<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> skin<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:18.180> causes

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
dermis or the skin and it and it causes

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.610 
dermis or the skin and it and it causes
collagen<00:02:19.700> remodeling<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.360> typing<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.840> skin<00:02:22.140> so
