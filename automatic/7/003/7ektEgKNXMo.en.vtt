behind me I'm looking everywhere to try
and<00:04:06.349> get<00:04:06.470> past<00:04:06.680> him<00:04:06.829> but<00:04:06.980> can't<00:04:07.190> into<00:04:07.459> these

corners trying to go around his outside

corners trying to go around his outside
there<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.799> again<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:10.519> no<00:04:10.819> it's<00:04:11.120> not<00:04:11.329> working

there and again that no it's not working

there and again that no it's not working
I'm<00:04:11.900> absolutely<00:04:12.709> all<00:04:12.829> over<00:04:12.859> but<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.400> can't<00:04:13.430> get

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
I'm absolutely all over but I can't get

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.000 
I'm absolutely all over but I can't get
past<00:04:14.079> still<00:04:15.079> looking<00:04:15.500> behind<00:04:15.620> him<00:04:15.829> could<00:04:15.980> I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
past still looking behind him could I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.440 
past still looking behind him could I
get<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.280> through<00:04:16.549> here<00:04:16.760> rally<00:04:17.000> outside<00:04:17.180> it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
get it through here rally outside it

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.240 
get it through here rally outside it
would<00:04:17.570> be<00:04:17.660> spectacular<00:04:17.959> stuff<00:04:18.680> if<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.889> did<00:04:19.070> but

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
would be spectacular stuff if I did but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.180 
would be spectacular stuff if I did but
that's<00:04:19.400> going<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.609> be<00:04:20.799> unlikely<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.889> be<00:04:22.010> pulled

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
that's going to be unlikely to be pulled

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.409 
that's going to be unlikely to be pulled
off<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.460> I've<00:04:22.550> got<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.849> I've<00:04:22.940> hit<00:04:23.150> him<00:04:23.300> in

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419

to<00:04:32.389> three<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.599> fourth<00:04:32.900> because<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.320> that<00:04:33.669> damn

to three and fourth because of that damn

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.520

Force<00:04:35.060> India<00:04:35.360> that's<00:04:35.630> come<00:04:35.840> through<00:04:35.870> hit<00:04:36.320> me

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
Force India that's come through hit me

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.250 
Force India that's come through hit me
and<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.400> had<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.910> domino<00:04:38.450> effect<00:04:38.479> into<00:04:39.169> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
and that had a domino effect into the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.770 
and that had a domino effect into the
salba<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.919> we've<00:04:40.669> both<00:04:40.880> lost<00:04:41.150> positions<00:04:41.660> so

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
salba and we've both lost positions so

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.330 
salba and we've both lost positions so
that<00:04:41.810> guy<00:04:42.080> should<00:04:42.320> have<00:04:42.349> a<00:04:42.500> penalty<00:04:42.770> in<00:04:42.919> theory

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
that guy should have a penalty in theory

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.650 
that guy should have a penalty in theory
but<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> chances<00:04:43.849> of<00:04:43.940> him<00:04:44.090> having<00:04:44.389> one<00:04:44.539> are

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
but the chances of him having one are

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.629 
but the chances of him having one are
unlikely<00:04:45.139> but<00:04:45.500> I've<00:04:45.650> committed<00:04:46.070> badly<00:04:46.430> there

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
unlikely but I've committed badly there

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.950 
unlikely but I've committed badly there
and<00:04:46.910> that's<00:04:47.419> going<00:04:47.599> to<00:04:47.690> be<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:47.810> penalty

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
and that's going to be a penalty

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.379 
and that's going to be a penalty
absolutely<00:04:48.949> old<00:04:49.070> yep<00:04:49.460> there<00:04:49.789> we<00:04:49.940> go<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.240> was

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
absolutely old yep there we go that was

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.629 
absolutely old yep there we go that was

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
racing it's the first one that I think

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.480 
racing it's the first one that I think
is<00:04:54.169> actually<00:04:54.289> justified<00:04:54.919> even<00:04:55.160> though<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.280> did

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
is actually justified even though I did

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.029 
is actually justified even though I did
try<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.120> in<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.229> gym<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.830> went

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.409 
try and in the gym so that you went
straight<00:04:58.190> rather<00:04:58.550> than<00:04:58.700> knocking<00:04:58.909> into<00:04:59.330> him

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
straight rather than knocking into him

straight rather than knocking into him

just charge it inside first opportunity
to<00:05:46.740> get<00:05:46.980> so<00:05:47.190> I<00:05:47.220> must<00:05:47.490> be<00:05:47.670> doing<00:05:48.300> something

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
right so I just I don't know but we are

this<00:05:55.050> guy<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.290> chances<00:05:55.800> of<00:05:55.830> me<00:05:56.010> not<00:05:56.190> finishing

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
this guy the chances of me not finishing

this guy the chances of me not finishing
last<00:05:56.850> now<00:05:57.000> are<00:05:57.150> highly<00:05:57.450> unlikely<00:05:57.570> because<00:05:58.170> of

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
last now are highly unlikely because of

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.470 
last now are highly unlikely because of
penalties<00:05:58.740> but<00:05:59.190> at<00:05:59.280> least<00:05:59.370> if<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.670> get<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.850> cross
