off spaces if you're not using them I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.210 
off spaces if you're not using them I
have<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:18.410> if<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.560> turn<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:19.949> they

slow<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.760> might<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.720> go<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
slow what you might want to do is go to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
slow what you might want to do is go to
doc<00:00:28.560> instead<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:30.000> hide<00:00:30.240> automatically<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.700> have

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
doc instead to hide automatically I have

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.020 
doc instead to hide automatically I have
it<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.920> set<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> scale<00:00:35.700> effect

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
it like that set it to scale effect

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.549 
it like that set it to scale effect
rather<00:00:36.600> than<00:00:36.989> ginia<00:00:37.500> fecht<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.230> turn<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
rather than ginia fecht you can turn the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.400 
rather than ginia fecht you can turn the
size<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.040> magnification<00:00:41.460> down<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:43.290> will

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
size and magnification down that will

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.240 
size and magnification down that will
also<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.399> less<00:00:44.610> processing<00:00:45.090> speed<00:00:46.250> energy

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
also use up less processing speed energy

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
also use up less processing speed energy
saver<00:00:50.840> should<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> first<00:00:52.350> three

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
saver should have the first three

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.479 
saver should have the first three
checked<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:55.410> might<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> turn<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.280> down

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
checked you might want to turn this down

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:06.219 
checked you might want to turn this down
a<00:00:56.550> bit<00:00:57.829> also<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.980> one<00:01:03.680> yeah<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:04.949> about<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
a bit also this one yeah that's about it

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.100 
a bit also this one yeah that's about it
and<00:01:09.290> go<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> display<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.960> bad

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and go to display if it's really bad

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.820 
and go to display if it's really bad
then<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> change<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.640> settings<00:01:15.060> here

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
then you can change the settings here

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.260 
then you can change the settings here
like<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.070> display<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> might<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> change

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
like in display you might want to change

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.429 
like in display you might want to change
it<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> thousands<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:20.869> have<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.960> our<00:01:22.080> millions

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it to thousands I have in our millions

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.870 
it to thousands I have in our millions
you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.340> reduce<00:01:23.610> your<00:01:23.670> resolution<00:01:25.130> as<00:01:26.130> I've

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you can reduce your resolution as I've

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.690 
you can reduce your resolution as I've
done

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810 

your<00:01:30.700> brightness<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:32.800> can<00:01:33.010> do<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.250> with<00:01:33.400> f1

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
your brightness you can do that with f1

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.850 
your brightness you can do that with f1
and<00:01:34.030> f2<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:39.310> are<00:01:39.460> some<00:01:40.530> tactics<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.620> you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
and f2 there are some tactics that you

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.550 
and f2 there are some tactics that you
can<00:01:42.010> do<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:43.000> example<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.750> can<00:01:43.930> turn<00:01:44.110> off<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
can do for example you can turn off the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
can do for example you can turn off the
dock<00:01:44.800> or<00:01:45.870> sorting<00:01:46.870> out<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.140> dock<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.650> the
