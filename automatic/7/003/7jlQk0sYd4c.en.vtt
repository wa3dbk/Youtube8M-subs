00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
which is still a big camera

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.950 
which is still a big camera
it's<00:02:24.620> not<00:02:24.740> as<00:02:24.920> big<00:02:25.100> as<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> d3s<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.750> brought

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
but if we were to compare it let's say

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.600 
but if we were to compare it let's say
hang<00:02:53.720> on<00:02:53.870> for<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> minute<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:58.280> we<00:02:58.400> were<00:02:58.520> to

there's definitely you know a bit of a
an<00:03:07.820> intimidation<00:03:08.450> factor<00:03:08.600> when<00:03:09.470> you're

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
an intimidation factor when you're

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.560 
an intimidation factor when you're
pointing<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.040> thing<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.490> people's<00:03:10.880> faces<00:03:11.120> at

kind of an informal event or an informal
party<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.960> mean<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.200> in<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.500> sense<00:03:15.560> that

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
party and I mean that in the sense that

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.870 
party and I mean that in the sense that
you<00:03:16.040> know<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.250> wasn't<00:03:16.460> like<00:03:16.670> some

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
you know this wasn't like some

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.760 
you know this wasn't like some
work-for-hire<00:03:17.270> where<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.080> know<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.230> went<00:03:18.590> and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
work-for-hire where you know I went and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.970 
work-for-hire where you know I went and
I<00:03:19.220> was<00:03:19.370> hired<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.910> take<00:03:20.360> pictures<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.800> there

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
I was hired to take pictures and there

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.890 
I was hired to take pictures and there
was<00:03:22.070> an<00:03:22.160> expectation<00:03:22.460> and<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.540> think<00:03:23.780> that

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
was an expectation and I think that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.600 
was an expectation and I think that
there's<00:03:24.050> probably<00:03:24.110> gonna<00:03:24.950> be<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.580> know

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
there's probably gonna be you know

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.850 
there's probably gonna be you know
differing<00:03:26.330> views<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:27.050> whole<00:03:27.260> thing<00:03:27.530> but

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
differing views on this whole thing but

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220 
differing views on this whole thing but
whatever<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.730> case<00:03:28.880> may<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.390> decided<00:03:29.960> to

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
whatever the case may be I decided to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.410 
whatever the case may be I decided to
travel<00:03:30.650> light<00:03:30.830> into<00:03:31.040> travel<00:03:31.370> small<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.910> just

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
travel light into travel small and just

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.300 
travel light into travel small and just
bring<00:03:32.600> one<00:03:32.810> lens<00:03:33.020> I<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.380> brought<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> 35<00:03:34.070> F

but not so wide that you get distortion
and<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:42.740> know<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:42.920> can<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:43.190> fill<00:03:43.490> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
and you know you can really fill the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.220 
and you know you can really fill the
frame<00:03:43.790> well<00:03:44.030> getting<00:03:44.450> close<00:03:44.690> enough<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.110> your

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
frame well getting close enough to your

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.590 
frame well getting close enough to your
subject<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.240> know<00:03:47.330> when<00:03:47.480> you're

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
subject so that you know when you're

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.140 
subject so that you know when you're
doing<00:03:47.690> party<00:03:48.170> shots<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.650> really<00:03:49.130> like<00:03:49.340> 35<00:03:50.120> I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
doing party shots I really like 35 I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.660 
doing party shots I really like 35 I
think<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.870> really<00:03:51.200> good<00:03:51.350> way<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.590> go<00:03:51.830> F<00:03:52.250> to

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
think it's a really good way to go F to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.460 
think it's a really good way to go F to
you<00:03:53.060> know<00:03:53.150> you've<00:03:53.330> got<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> nice<00:03:53.750> wide<00:03:54.230> aperture

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
you know you've got a nice wide aperture

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.560 
you know you've got a nice wide aperture
so<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.250> can<00:03:55.400> shoot<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.940> little<00:03:56.450> bit

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
so that you can shoot a little bit

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.690 
so that you can shoot a little bit
better<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:56.930> low<00:03:57.050> light<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.500> actually<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.190> opted

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
better in low light and actually I opted

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.199 
better in low light and actually I opted
to<00:03:58.730> use<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.530> built<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:00.709> flash<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.790> use<00:04:02.060> the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
to use the built on flash and I use the

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.320 
to use the built on flash and I use the
flash<00:04:02.420> in<00:04:02.630> TTL<00:04:03.170> granted<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.070> know<00:04:04.190> these<00:04:04.940> are

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
flash in TTL granted you know these are

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.480 
flash in TTL granted you know these are
party<00:04:06.020> shots<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.560> that's<00:04:06.650> really<00:04:07.130> what<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.310> was
