00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.980
 the very beginning of its existence 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.720
 Astana drawings with only five 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.370
 the forest goal set itself the only 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.470
 the goal is to win and only win on 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.120
 all possible tournament defeat final 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.190
 or the top 3 for the team were considered 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.930
 disastrous performance now dragons 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.670
 together with ninja pajamas meego regent 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 represents the avant-garde world prices by 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.120
 counter-strike global offencive being 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
 favorites in any tournament in which 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.870
 they are involved but now the organization 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.410
 takes a new course whose name is league 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.420
 legends 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.860
 The game Lego Friends is very popular 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 prize just huge but 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.490
 tournament coverage at very high 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.650
 level but as always not without 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.840
 a few but the first is 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.410
 the process of keeping the compositions of the top five 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.970
 league of legends 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.800
 it's very difficult to sponsor because they 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.750
 require much more than players in 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.580
 counter-strike and here is the second but probably 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.259
 will outweigh 1 at the moment or you 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.390
 world league of legends filled under 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.729
 tie out and hit the prize area not that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.890
 so difficult almost impossible to think 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.660
 the task of organizing sandra gams is not easy 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.550
 take the composition for prestige she needs 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.380
 victories and more than once a year many can 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.600
 ask why not the second dota yes all 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.490
 because 2 dose also reserved 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.590
 places for the world elite practically 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.300
 each tournament in general perspective 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.069
 it's hard to say 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.610
 about the next now the league of legends will be 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.619

 the most interesting novelty is of course 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.810
 cooperative mode and it is assumed that 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.000
 several players will fight in it 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.920
