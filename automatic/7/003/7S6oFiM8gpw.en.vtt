00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.810 

something<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.879> square<00:00:46.979> now<00:00:47.979> at<00:00:48.370> this<00:00:48.549> point

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
something the square now at this point

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.640 
something the square now at this point
you're<00:00:49.030> going<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.180> take<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:50.170> point<00:00:50.379> right

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
here is very important that's going to

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.240 
here is very important that's going to
be<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.170> hole<00:00:53.379> in<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.710> center<00:00:54.040> of<00:00:54.070> your

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
be the hole in the center of your

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.189 
be the hole in the center of your
cartouche<00:00:54.729> to<00:00:55.239> let<00:00:55.390> some<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.659> the<00:00:55.720> steam<00:00:55.780> out

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
cartouche to let some of the steam out

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.960 
cartouche to let some of the steam out
one<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.799> the<00:00:56.890> reasons<00:00:57.220> just<00:00:57.460> like<00:00:57.640> you<00:00:57.790> use

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
one of the reasons just like you use

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.570 
one of the reasons just like you use
part<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.299> chisel<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:58.989> doesn't<00:00:59.860> let<00:00:59.949> any<00:01:00.220> steam

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
part to chisel it doesn't let any steam

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.600 
part to chisel it doesn't let any steam
it<00:01:00.729> again

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
it again

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.760 
it again
oil<00:01:02.000> with<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.660> cartouche<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.260> just<00:01:03.440> lets<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
oil with the cartouche it just lets the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.439 
oil with the cartouche it just lets the
simmer<00:01:04.010> because<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:04.640> at<00:01:04.760> least<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.120> some<00:01:05.330> of

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
simmer because there at least as some of

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.330 
simmer because there at least as some of
the<00:01:05.540> steam<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.530> at<00:01:06.620> this<00:01:06.710> point<00:01:06.980> that's<00:01:07.160> where

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
the steam so at this point that's where

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.740 
the steam so at this point that's where
your<00:01:07.460> whole<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.730> gonna<00:01:07.880> be<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.540> you're<00:01:08.660> gonna

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
your whole is gonna be and you're gonna

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.170 
your whole is gonna be and you're gonna
go<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.200> keep<00:01:09.320> lending<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.890> other<00:01:10.040> folds<00:01:10.640> to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
go and keep lending and other folds to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.050 
go and keep lending and other folds to
that<00:01:11.420> make<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.110> bit<00:01:12.290> rate<00:01:12.530> left<00:01:12.800> airplane<00:01:13.250> we

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
that make it a bit rate left airplane we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.970 
that make it a bit rate left airplane we
all<00:01:14.180> used<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.420> do<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.650> me<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.830> nice

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
all used to do that and to me a nice

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.940 
all used to do that and to me a nice
boat<00:01:16.310> make<00:01:17.240> there<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:17.810> then<00:01:18.020> one<00:01:18.290> here<00:01:20.950> fold

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
boat make there and then one here fold

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.840 
boat make there and then one here fold
gonna<00:01:22.310> fold

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
gonna fold

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.140 
gonna fold
so<00:01:23.300> now<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.630> looks<00:01:23.950> like<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:26.000> can<00:01:26.030> see

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
so now it looks like so and you can see

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.630 
so now it looks like so and you can see
that<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:26.570> have<00:01:26.660> a<00:01:26.720> fold<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:27.250> fold<00:01:28.250> here<00:01:28.460> at

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
that you have a fold here fold here at

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.250 
that you have a fold here fold here at
fault<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.600> now<00:01:29.750> it's<00:01:29.900> going<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.080> create

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
fault here so now it's going to create

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.650 
fault here so now it's going to create
out<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.440> little<00:01:30.590> hole<00:01:30.860> say<00:01:31.550> making<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.240> triangle

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
out a little hole say making a triangle

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.200 
out a little hole say making a triangle
fold<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.410> triangle<00:01:33.740> cut<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.729> you're<00:01:34.850> gonna<00:01:34.940> take

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
fold a triangle cut so you're gonna take

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.719 
fold a triangle cut so you're gonna take
to<00:01:35.360> cut<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.660> for<00:01:35.869> me<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.229> then<00:01:37.100> move<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.610> this

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
to cut this for me and then move it this

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.480 
to cut this for me and then move it this
way<00:01:37.790> away<00:01:38.150> from<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.900> make<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.350> cut<00:01:39.680> that

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
way take a little triangle you're gonna

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.980 
way take a little triangle you're gonna
come<00:01:42.830> up<00:01:42.860> here<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.030> last<00:01:44.210> piece<00:01:44.600> and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
come up here to the last piece and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.660 
come up here to the last piece and
you're<00:01:45.440> gonna<00:01:45.619> stop<00:01:45.860> making<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.190> little<00:01:46.399> circle

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you're gonna stop making a little circle

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
you're gonna stop making a little circle
I'm<00:01:49.670> gonna<00:01:49.910> circle<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.540> how<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.509> is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
I'm gonna circle this how and this is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.960 
I'm gonna circle this how and this is
what<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.899> looks<00:01:54.050> like
