00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.580
 time for new when my colleague 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.680
 lost and government debt trainer 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.360
 asked where castaignos was because he 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.960
 was missing at the training 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 when she schreuder goes there ted 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.440
 lions and announcements about doing how 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.760
 let him share 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 Well I he was planning an opinion 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.140
 about i don't know where i am right now 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.960
 has but we have luc permission 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 to handle a transfer 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.769
 that means that it just doesn't 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 comes back to the ring no that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 means he has a chance 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
 transfer off the or the unions if it is not 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 if it succeeds then 3 then you come back 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.800
 but we go there from that succeeds 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.879
 and then it wouldn't come back in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 death 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.850
 That means that there is currently 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 a concrete coal and club 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.210
 interested and that there 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.850
 can be negotiated, there is 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 negotiated indeed club does that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 that is up to the club to announce 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 domestic or foreign club please 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.059
 say something about that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.859
 they would come where the I don't do it 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.010
 does not make announcements about it 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.010
 is 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.060
 if castaignos leaves there has that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.299
 of course what consequence for tents because 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.430
 with austria coming from young fc twente 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.439
 happening and citizen currently 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.650
 If the injury is injured, the rinse is somewhat thinner 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.590
 it would be a transfer from luc 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 castaignos only mean the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.570
 annoying financial position of fc 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.020
 twente 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.040
 what is expected is brightened up or 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 It also means that for FC Twente 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.890
 room for investment 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.310
 to do 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 yes it both means a bit 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.909
 we have to reach a certain amount 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.420
 everyone knows that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.229
 both in transfer proceeds and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.899
 reduction of salary expenses 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.810
 showering 6 they already twente themselves around with that 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.560
 club 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.820
 we are basically a sound 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.520
 so expected within a few days 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.049
 basically just that there is positive message 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.610
 comes across Luc Castaignos so he 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.380
 go to another club 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.810
 yes and it's up to you to judge if 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.090
 that is positive or negative but that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.619
 smoke comes from the chimney 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.149
 expect 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.679
 how you find it yourself Luc Castaignos the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.610
 city ​​is the peak of recent years 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.730
 been to fc twente 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.130
 it now goes away what do you think of it 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.680
 yes fun is just a really good one 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.030
 play tent has a lot of good ones 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.910
 players 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.980
 I'm never confused about that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.780
 it is this year's financial 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.370
 situation needs it there must be a little 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.260
 forced 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 but in principle we are in the Netherlands 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.269
 naturally so dependent on it 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.580
 buying, developing and selling 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.209
 players but the normal cycle is bad 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.950
 and we have large shadow lists now 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.910
 as long as you have that apple there is nothing to it 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.470
 hand 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.000
 especially if you are a layman and fc 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.200
 twente looks and you are now a couple 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.090
 busy for weeks then you could 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.760
 wonder where have you been in recent weeks 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.459
 been busy with it because there is not much left 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.579
 movement yes but that is not due 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.579
 that depends on the fact that that 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.109
 windows just didn't move there were none 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.760
 transfer 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.760
 as an individual club you can do that there 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.350
 blue was very big you can do little 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.970
 influence 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.319
 so that club that they are all now 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.109
 started again 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.930
 It you see it everywhere the transfer them 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.160
 and then we had to wait 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.930
 difficult is it for you to get inside the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.280
 current space that fc twente financially 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.040
 has to look for example 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.799
 a good successor for luc castaignos 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.200
 Well Tents is up when they joined me 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.359
 they just got the situation 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.340
 explained that was also the reason why they 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.049
 came to me she was there 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.840
 so then i dont have to complain about that 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.359
 just how and how to handle it and that is 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.680
 everything but the list is ready as 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.109
 that actually always goes at club die 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.220
 there is always a list ready 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.970
 you sometimes experience that and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.889
 finally a little bit 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.130
 disappointing are those players feasible for 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.800
 twente well you make those lists 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.500
 based on feasibility 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.970
 and if it takes a long time then the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.130
 Sometimes safes evaporate from too 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.100
 those players go elsewhere to 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.890
 but in schouten is a permanent process 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.980
 and we always have a list for that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 every position for every player so me 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.280
 never get confused 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.290
 we've been working here for a few weeks here at FC 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.530
 twente what is your first impression after 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.560
 great club for big club everyone 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.380
 is shocked and committed by the or what 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.420
 now there is this process 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.940
 has occurred in many places elsewhere too 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.490
 played and yes 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.810
 get it right again maybe not like that 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.460
 soon one you have been to vitesse 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.550
 lined 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.660
 yes and there it was often 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.850
 restless 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.950
 yes that was the ar yes as far as that is concerned 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.600
 noah they compared the rest here 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.100
 arnhem 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.850
 was this morning was the first training 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.110
 people might still be there 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.460
 well looked a bit skeptical 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.090
 what's going to happen 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.140
 supporters will report they will go 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.950
 for example protest against it 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.690
 tore 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.950
 about whom supporters groups say yes 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.570
 he would no longer be a trainer of them 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.740
 students have to be actually is everything 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.770
 lost 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.919
 went very quietly yes and why would 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.830
 it's not about them excellent trainer 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.710
 fits perfectly with FC Twente and yes 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.360
 everyone knows it so I yes to me as 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.560
 nothing really 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.180
 That has a little to do with 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.830
 that letter that has recently been taken from 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.880
 from the board of fc twente to the 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.950
 subplots groups 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.330
 let's save the side no that would 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.760
 You can have father who supporters 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.840
 I didn't look into it 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.210
 but I'm actually here for this 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.860
 technical matters and all those others 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.720
 things then I don't know too much 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.550
 that is also a bit of an advantage when you get in 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.740
 abroad was there at the time 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.260
 it was so hungry I did it all 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.120
 of many inherited and wear and 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.010
 that is also less so 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.590
 Well you are in the technical business 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.970
 you are also the trainer 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.710
 luc castaignos is going to leave what finds 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.260
 you can say torn it yourself 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.030
 have to ask them but it is so 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.650
 that juda 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.930
 mutually agree or gives that 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.840
 not at all a difficult position for me 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.919
 we do everything in consultation including ours 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.710
 technical staff 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.300
 knows very well what the situation is and 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.400
 situation is that we have to sell 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.729
 until we become a certain amount to ai 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.290
 have that the curia long and wide about 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.539
 souring and talking but it is a fact 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.210
 and that he accepts away and so we go 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.190
 dealing with it is now mainly about luc 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.320
 castaignos but andreas bjelland is too 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.850
 a player for whom clips or a club 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.680
 way of england 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.169
 would still be interested 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.039
 always so that every every every every player 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.630
 Buying FC Twente is yes if you do 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.250
 so it says and seems like that or four 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.289
 players traded 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.320
 there is place certain games themselves or those 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:45.530
 wants to go and were in that wants to go on the 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.500
 Secondly it is true that on it 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.419
 moment we have achieved that amount 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.710
 and it no longer needs well you do it 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.510
 neither anymore 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.389
 fc twente is open in principle 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.490
 for a bid on any games 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.930
 yes but not only fc twente all clubs 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.660
 in the Netherlands are in such 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.220
 position can imagine me if you 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.530
 technical director give them the ajax that you 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.349
 have it easy 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.030
 I don't think so you actually have one 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.229
 what other environment you are dealing with 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.919
 have got 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.750
 and just did watch the smallest club in 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.849
 the premier league the who has more money 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.130
 than total gentlemen the vision from the 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:24.020
 television applies well with that is the 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.490
 Dutch position thumb wheel 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.039
 last question for his supporters 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.360
 very dissatisfied with FC Twente have 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.280
 no longer fancy the season 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.599
 they said 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.949
 what can you say to those supporters 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:35.419
 which may make them more hungry 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:36.770
 get to come to the stadium 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:39.229
 during the first match 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.370
 Well at the moment there is no player yet 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.110
 attracted 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.789
 the moment that happens is must 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.199
 we ask another christian 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.000

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:49.669

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.800
 a little bit if you like those lists 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.510
 in sees and thinks yes that would be the 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.310
 you can say you can 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.449

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.139
