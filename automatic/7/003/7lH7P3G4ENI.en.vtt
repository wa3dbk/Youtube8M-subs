they do not have a full tang which is
something<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.930> I<00:02:11.110> was<00:02:11.320> looking<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
something that I was looking for and the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.300 
something that I was looking for and the
ones<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.580> our<00:02:15.730> carbon<00:02:16.270> steel<00:02:17.310> which

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
ones that I have our carbon steel which

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.070 
ones that I have our carbon steel which
means<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.850> they<00:02:19.180> will<00:02:19.830> rust<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.900> can

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
means that they will rust as you can

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.290

about<00:02:25.720> her<00:02:25.870> kind<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.920> getting<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.520> way<00:02:28.380> but

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
about her kind of getting in the way but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:54.020 
about her kind of getting in the way but
let's<00:02:30.940> try<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.240> work<00:02:31.450> around<00:02:31.660> them

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.710 

and<00:02:54.480> I've<00:02:54.930> noticed<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:55.980> toward<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
and I've noticed that up toward the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.220 
and I've noticed that up toward the
front<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.990> blade<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.950> tapers<00:02:59.280> off<00:02:59.730> and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
front of the blade it tapers off and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.990 
front of the blade it tapers off and
when<00:03:01.230> you're<00:03:01.350> making<00:03:01.980> feather<00:03:02.310> sticks<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
when you're making feather sticks and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.260 
when you're making feather sticks and
things<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:06.000> some

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
things like that you can really do some

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.230 
things like that you can really do some
delicate<00:03:06.840> work<00:03:07.220> up<00:03:08.220> toward<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.700> tip<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.209> that

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
delicate work up toward the tip of that

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:21.220 
delicate work up toward the tip of that
knife<00:03:09.569> blade

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.869 

nada<00:03:22.390> anyways<00:03:26.680> not<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.709> great<00:03:28.159> feather<00:03:28.489> stick

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
nada anyways not a great feather stick

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.619 
nada anyways not a great feather stick
because<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.590> knots<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.299> whatnot<00:03:32.299> in<00:03:32.510> it

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
because of the knots and whatnot in it

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:41.080 
because of the knots and whatnot in it
but<00:03:32.840> uh<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:35.049> fall<00:03:36.049> livin<00:03:37.150> f1<00:03:38.260> does<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:40.090> great

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
but uh the fall livin f1 does a great

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.080 
but uh the fall livin f1 does a great
job<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:43.120> bushcraft<00:03:44.120> type<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.750> work<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.670> blade

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
job for bushcraft type of work the blade

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.680 
job for bushcraft type of work the blade
is<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:48.340> fairly<00:03:49.340> thick<00:03:51.099> which<00:03:52.390> might<00:03:53.390> think

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
is a fairly thick which might think

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.280 
is a fairly thick which might think
