00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.509
 Come on, come here! 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.669
 Edu, come here! 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.279
 Come on, work a little! 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.609
 Today we will explain to you what kind of weekly gifting we have to do 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 rabbits we have as pet animals. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.279
 Important: 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.279
 one important thing is brushing. 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.730
 We continue: 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.920
 The brushing of a rabbit must be 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.400
 vigorous and made with a special brush, because 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.430
 you see well, 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 take 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760
 all hair 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.060
 all the dead hair. 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.140
 There are hard brushes 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 with some special close bristles 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.229
 each other 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.370
 to be able to take off 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.470
 all this annoying hair for the animal and which can additionally create 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.610
 complications. 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.010
 After brushing we can take advantage 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.730
 to cut his nails. 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.780
 Cutting nails 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.760
 is an important thing. 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.990
 We brought Edu without the nails, 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.259
 well, to name it completely, he's called Eduard Man Scissors 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.470
 and you will immediately find out why. 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.380
 Because he has some huge nails, I did not cut them off 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.510
 for a month. 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.250
 And forget, 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.060
 look at the back legs, 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.460
 what thick nails he raised. 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.000
 Even the front ones, although not exactly the ones behind, are quite large. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.670
 How do we cut them off? 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.960
 We will cut them with a forfaith, 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.430
 small and with great precision. 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.359
 In addition, 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.890
 we have to know 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.360
 like cutting 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.119
 It is only done on the white portion, never have to reach 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.960
 to the veins. We're at a distance 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.789
 about 1-2 mm of the vein. It is very easy, 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.949
 because rabbits have white nails 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.869
 and it sees very well where it can be cut. 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.169
 When the nails are black is a little more complicated. 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.989
 After I cut their nails, 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.980
 if you want, you can sip them a little with a manicure pillow. 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.739
 With the saw we'll get rid of those corners 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.579
 what bothers us so much. 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.589
 Do you know why your nails are so long? 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:39.519
 They are long because they grow naturally to dig the galleries. 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.089
 So if you have a garden 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.169
 where animals can dig, 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.839
 including putting some small stones on them, you'll see them 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.319
 they will have their own nails and you will not have to worry about them 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.809
 or cut them so often. 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:53.849
 And that's all. 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.890
 Just do not call Edward the Scissor Man, it's just Eduard ... Pa! Pa!
