00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:01.601
 - In this episode, I talk 

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.263
 Mobile TV budget video, 

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:06.294
 I am talking about wine. 

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:07.849
 Yeah, I am still talking about it. 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.407
 I talk about how I stay at the top. 

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:13.542
 Technology from San Francisco. 

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.708
 You have been asking questions. 

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.288
 I will continue to answer for you. 

00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:22.445
 (light music) 

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:25.039
 Everyone, this is Gary VAY-NER-Bamboo 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.338
 And you see 29 episodes 

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:29.298
 #AskGaryVee shows. 

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:31.099
 Interesting is about 29%, 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.184
 I don't have one. 

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:34.364
 So, we are here. 

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:36.731
 The SF office you have not seen. 

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:38.524
 Most of you are in my entire VaynerNation 

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.244
 Never seen SF office 

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.152
 So this is an exciting episode of my current market. 

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.993
 Here in San Francisco. 

00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:46.598
 Peek into a huge crew here. 

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:47.845
 Shout out your guy. 

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:49.449
 I am very happy to do this with you. 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.906
 Also, I want a little bit of the new format bit today. 

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.858
 I want a little bit short 

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:55.643
 Such feedback, the problem of the day, 

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:57.560
 What kind of three-question format do you think? 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.526
 The format of the five questions? 

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.721
 Yes, I have no problem in the early days. 

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.581
 Handle it. 

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:04.584
 - [Mayanmurfee] Ben asked, 

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:06.676
 "What are your thoughts recently? 

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:10.764
 25% of mobile advertising online video? " 

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.883
 - Therefore, for small businesses or entrepreneurs, 

00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:16.174
 Hongmeng Group is the agent of Damo Group 

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.254
 In my world VaynerMedia these days 

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:20.181
 And they did a lot of what is called the working medium, 

00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:21.816
 The flower you spend is distributed. 

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:23.805
 Do not create content. 

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.908
 This is how we do a lot in social channels. 

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:28.733
 But not on TV, newspapers, radio, all that kind of thing 

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.275
 So I just want to think about setting up the stage. 

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:34.380
 This makes me afraid of things 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.221
 And general statement types 

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.489
 Yes, when people think of online video, 

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:41.903
 They want to spend five, 10% 

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:42.926
 Total budget, 

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:44.645
 Let us call it $100,000. 

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.202
 In film and television production, 

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:47.756
 Quality, Dongdong 

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.631
 And in the distribution of 95 

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.863
 Then what did they spend, 

00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:52.420
 Maybe up to 80. 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.017
 Maybe 80 to 90. 

00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:54.784
 Let's say, 80. 

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:57.325
 I want to be polite here today in San Francisco 

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.208
 Because it has a little more polite atmosphere 

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:00.833
 Than New York. 

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.130
 80% of the time, 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.833
 Their right hook form jumps. 

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.713
 What online video means most people? 

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:08.187
 Let me explain what this means. 

00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:10.380
 This is a pre-roll ad on YouTube. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.215
 People tabs come out 

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.483
 It is not actually used. 

00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:15.137
 You go to espn.com and the video pops up 

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:17.356
 And take more than 30 seconds to use 

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.660
 This makes me annoyed. 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.295
 What are you waiting for, what I am most worried about 

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:21.325
 When I heard people assign 

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:23.409
 And its bigger story, this is part 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.736
 People talk about mobile TV budget 

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:26.974
 Go to other places. 

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:30.517
 My problem is actually I like live TV ads. 

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.871
 I prefer banner ads on the site than I do. 

00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.800
 And intro video 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.347
 This is blocking users 

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:37.705
 From doing what they want. 

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.074
 So this is not traditional or digital. 

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:42.090
 This is the value you bring 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.412
 When I heard about mobile TV 

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:46.008
 And turn it into an online video, 

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.070
 I know what is going on in the real world of practitioners. 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.415
 Is people spending money on online videos 

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:53.417
 This is an annoying customer 

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.590
 And put it somewhere they don't want it 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.972
 And invest more money percentage 

00:02:57.972 --> 00:03:00.165
 Creating great videos in practice 

00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:02.005
 Then find a more primitive way 

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:03.308
 To be distributed. 

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.250
 Having said that, 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.794
 Facebook's dark post video is native to me 

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:08.465
 Is a very attractive option, 

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:09.703
 Especially if you have already seen it, 

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:10.723
 Audio cannot be played 

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.226
 But if you go in, you click on it. 

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.584
 So this is my general idea, 

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:15.220
 This is in theory its greatness 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.258
 The traditional dollar we are moving over 

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:20.805
 But I saw a lot of people misplaying numbers. 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.095
 - [mayanmurfee] Laura asks, 

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:24.100
 "Friday, we drink wine. 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.610
 What is a good family to drink alone 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.909
 A bottle of wine yourself? " 

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.663
 - Laura, me, 

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:31.817
 Laura? - [Voiceover] Laura. 

00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:34.083
 - Laura, I am a big white wine fan. 

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.237
 I am really obsessed with the place. 

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:40.213
 These days are Italian white pipi 

00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:42.002
 So NPG. 

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:42.913
 And I mean 

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:45.192
 Look for something like Sopho. 

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.792
 Looking for Didufo, Greece. 

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.399
 Look for Fiano. 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:52.001
 These other varieties white Italy 

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.842
 There are a lot of people out there who don't know them. 

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:56.050
 They are not aware of their quality. 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.479
 I think that between $8 and $22, 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.658
 You can get a huge array 

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.353
 Huge high quality acid 

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:05.417
 Drink by yourself 

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:06.840
 But waiting for me to drink 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.323
 But now I want a little cheese 

00:04:08.323 --> 00:04:10.041
 Still able to fold into 

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.194
 So Italian white wine is very much for me. 

00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:16.337
 And Stunwin because I know you are going to be with DRock, 

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:18.043
 When you edit this episode, 

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:21.031
 Throw a couple of logos here. 

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:22.382
 Actually took over my entire face. 

00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:25.325
 Showing seven eight Italian white logo 

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.128
 In the range of eight to twenty dollars 

00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:29.048
 People can slow motion video 

00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:29.867
 And the name of the capture 

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:32.298
 Or link below. 

00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:33.383
 - [mayanmurfee] asked Matthew, 

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.020
 "Please talk about the upcoming company. 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.762
 And predict their success. 

00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:39.748
 Where and how to find the rise of these companies? " 

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:43.021
 - Matt, that's why I like this damn show. 

00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.311
 We are entering the actual tangible things 

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.871
 Not just that buzz I have to do on stage 

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:48.623
 Because I only have one hour 

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.872
 And I let you pay attention and then drilled you. 

00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:52.510
 This is the quality of this exhibition. 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.095
 Here are two private facts you should do every day. 

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:56.036
 I have to add one third. 

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.183
 three things. 

00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.901
 Jason Hessehorn. 

00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:01.973
 Pause because I was thinking about Google it 

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:03.118
 Then what I want to say is the soldier. 

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:03.895
 Then I was caught. 

00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:04.795
 You know, I have never been caught 

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:06.636
 So a bit rusty, here in San Francisco. 

00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:07.766
 Google Jason Hessehorn. 

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.911
 What is the media referee, I think it is. 

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.803
 He has a newsletter. 

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:12.682
 Great way to stay on top of it. 

00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:13.709
 Techmeme 

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:16.293
 TECHMEME 

00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:17.474
 Recode. 

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.989
 These are two blogs, I think, 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:20.782
 Ok, Techmeme's all the news aggregates. 

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:21.841
 I go there every morning. 

00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:23.397
 See what bubbling. 

00:05:23.397 --> 00:05:24.830
 Recoding I just want to be general 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.832
 TechCrunch's and this is mostly just solid 

00:05:26.832 --> 00:05:28.390
 But all the convergence of Techmeme 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.001
 So I go to the technology MEM every morning. 

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:31.957
 Everything I read. 

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.300
 This helps me see things 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.705
 Then my little bit of the most interesting crack. 

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.781
 I went to iTunes every morning in the App Store. 

00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:40.457
 Click the application tab 

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:44.869
 And look forward to 150 before paying and free apps 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:46.914
 In the iTunes store 

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:49.167
 Get feeling when things are bubbling. 

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:52.020
 Regardless of yak, Snapchat, 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.954
 Many of these things I watched organic growth 

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.173
 Through the channel 

00:05:57.173 --> 00:05:59.269
 Before TechMemes and recoding 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.619
 Even told them 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:02.423
 So it is about the work of input. 

00:06:02.423 --> 00:06:05.074
 That's two tips for your day. 

00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:06.350
 Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for watching. 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.950
 29 episodes displayed in #AskGaryVee 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.015
 Here in San Francisco. 

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:12.171
 Again, let me know what you are thinking 

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.663
 The format of these three questions 

00:06:13.663 --> 00:06:15.582
 With five. 

00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:17.142
 You have been asking questions. 

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.931
 I will continue to answer them. 

00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:19.773
 Oh, nonsense, and so on. 

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:21.674
 subscription. 

00:06:22.777 --> 00:06:24.199
 I need to subscribe 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.804
 Because I can't put so many right uppercuts 

00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:28.725
 Society is so subscribed.
