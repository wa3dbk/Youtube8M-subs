00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.300
 we are doing the implosion of one of 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.859
 the two buildings that prevented the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.009
 development of the square jairo varela 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.710
 that's going to be important is the 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.079
 avianca post office building that already 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.600
 we have in look until soon we have 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.559
 the resources that we buy and it is already 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.720
 perfectly smooth all the space what 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.339
 nice thing about this is that it integrates with the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.290
 avenida colombia there is a project 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.829
 spectacular architectural 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.019
 they are donating a Dutch group and 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.680
 we have several here I come today with the 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:57.220
 maestro santiago cárdenas who is 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.020
 very famous painter to see that he can not 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.740
 it occurs to him to help improve 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.740
 space 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.819
 difficulty was in that that building 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.960
 it was about 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:24.429
 occupants who did not want to deliver it a 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 negotiation is very complicated until 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.740
 finally we could do it with the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 narcotics and finally the last 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.080
 person came out this morning I was 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.900
 in an apartment and I did not want to do it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.940
 but abandonment that comes now because the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.830
 engineers tell me that the second stage 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.479
 it takes nine months to be there 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.550
 working day and night to see if you can 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.340
 advancing the process will increase the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.930
 parking space and upload 250 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 and it is going to continue with this space that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 for what we have already seen has a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 utility and a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.670
 extraordinary beauty so that 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.290
 We are very pleased that this is 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.930
 one more step in the process 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.030
 Modernization of Cali in the next 15 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.030
 days we will be removing debris and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.989
 we started the excavation of two basements 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.350
 for the construction of parking lots we 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.410
 sixty parking spaces are needed 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.350
 we finished the platform which is going to 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.010
 unite with the mail platform 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.380
 and we're going to make a building similar to 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.040
 that we have already built where we are going to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.740
 make three floors for restaurants and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.350
 terraces so that they come and they are 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.250
 Caleños enjoying this area so 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.250
 pretty city
