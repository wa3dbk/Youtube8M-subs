00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139
 two 

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.410
 what we have talked with the guys 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.300
 before the match or rather after 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.519
 of the game of Barcelona is we have the 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.179
 party in bilbao may be the last 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.910
 match of the season but let's 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.599
 do it as we know how we are 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.920
 the best 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:25.460
 can be in the character league of 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.740
 literally leave the skin of the court 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.420
 and the truth 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.420
 he's awesome with that team 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.820
 against everything we have what is 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.760
 happening with the team more with the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 injuries 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 alex mumbru played in barcelona not after 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.149
 of the match with 18 38 temperatures with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 fever and was in bed every day 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.829
 has not trained nor good has come here 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.839
 a day to see the gift of the doctor and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.390
 before the game I was also bad 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.530
 I think it's an example 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.430
 is an example for young players 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.900
 that he has to follow 16 and he does Maltese or 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.900
 if you get from 8 meters 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 or the attitude of the unne 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.460
 the heart of laurel heart of all 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 the guys I'm very very proud of the ex 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.030
 from that very proud team 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.979
 then he will not talk today 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.750
 I will not speak today I basketball 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.560
 I think he deserves that team in 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.560
 recognition 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.650
 sometimes there are no words 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.090
 and nothing I thank you very much and on Tuesday 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.790
 let's fight again let's fight 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 again they asked on television 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.549
 before match can be the last 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.640
 match as is 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.070
 nobody likes that he has to already the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.450
 last match with the season 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 especially to us 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.159
 and he said that good to me I would like 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.039
 be the fifth final and win the league 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.259
 Of course I have arrived there is a last 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.369
 match of the season but not 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.369
 we wanted to end like this 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.849
 questions 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.590
 and when it came to the end of book you 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.800
 you were excited not so much as those 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.240
 well a little yes a little yes I think that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.250
 It is very human and very normal why 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.670
 we are fighting we have fought all the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.560
 season against many things and I think 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.730
 that that wants a chance that deserves that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.730
 team an acknowledgment 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.740
 at the end they are a little fired when 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 has occurred to people and this does not 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.540
 look let's see let's give a thing if 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.180
 we lose on Tuesday we will not have the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.820
 fortune to come back here and from the people 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.700
 of the season as always as each 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.550
 season that's why the people who have come 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.070
 today because team believes in him 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.770
 like basketball likes the team 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.020
 then we have to get to do them and 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.520
 describe them about this is another one that will be 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.730
 that's why with nothing else there is not a theme 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.890
 of the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.890
 hopefully we will hopefully the team 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.159
 got a victory and make a 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.659
 true miracle on Tuesday but 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.210
 well we all know that it is very very 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.290
 hard 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.040
 and we say goodbye to another nice people 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.040
 when you leave each time 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.810
 we told axel what possibilities 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.080
 I saw you on Tuesday I suppose you grab 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.790
 to whatever it is not for nothing 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.379
 and that gives us the string players 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.829
 with the attitude with character that has 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.450
 that team because it's a team that I think 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.209
 you because you follow the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.090
 team every day I remember that 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.890
 we have some excuse 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.680
 economic theme of the subject of injuries 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.829
 nothing a team always with the head 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.829
 high 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.819
 the waves good thanks to you
