00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
next up let's start testing the product

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
next up let's start testing the product
by<00:01:07.979> placing<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:08.850> products<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> checking<00:01:09.869> if

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
by placing some products and checking if

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
by placing some products and checking if
it's<00:01:10.200> able<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> attract<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> weight<00:01:11.640> or<00:01:11.850> not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's able to attract the weight or not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
it's able to attract the weight or not
so<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.380> tried<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so here as you can see I have tried the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.340 
so here as you can see I have tried the
placing<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.509> lightweight<00:01:15.810> objects

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
placing some very lightweight objects

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.070 
placing some very lightweight objects
maybe<00:01:16.710> something<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> range<00:01:17.880> of

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
maybe something which is in the range of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.230 
maybe something which is in the range of
one<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:19.350> cages<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.700> me<00:01:20.850> scale<00:01:21.090> could

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
one to two cages but the me scale could

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
one to two cages but the me scale could
not<00:01:21.420> detect<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> next<00:01:22.650> step<00:01:22.770> when<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> sharted

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
not detect that next step when I sharted

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
not detect that next step when I sharted
adding<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:23.790> weight<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:25.229> more

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
adding more weight so that's more

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.490 
adding more weight so that's more
pressure<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:26.009> pressing<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> top<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
pressure by pressing it on the top it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.280 
pressure by pressing it on the top it
started<00:01:28.860> showing<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.939> display<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.960> finally

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
started showing the display now finally

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
started showing the display now finally
here<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.710> actual<00:01:32.159> demo<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.939> see

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
here is the actual demo here you can see

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
here is the actual demo here you can see
that<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> numbers<00:01:33.659> keep<00:01:33.840> fluctuating<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that the numbers keep fluctuating and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.960 
that the numbers keep fluctuating and
that<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> something<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.850> pretty

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that is something which is pretty

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
that is something which is pretty
confusing<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
confusing for me so here you can see the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.780 
confusing for me so here you can see the
first<00:01:37.799> time<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.040> tried<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> showed<00:01:38.579> me<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
first time I tried it showed me in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.630 
first time I tried it showed me in
seventy<00:01:39.240> nine<00:01:39.360> point<00:01:39.570> eight<00:01:39.920> while<00:01:40.920> within<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
seventy nine point eight while within a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
seventy nine point eight while within a
few<00:01:41.790> seconds<00:01:42.150> again<00:01:42.689> tested<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> same<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
few seconds again tested the same and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
few seconds again tested the same and
this<00:01:44.070> time<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.430> showed<00:01:44.700> me<00:01:44.850> seventy<00:01:45.240> nine

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
this time it showed me seventy nine

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.660 
this time it showed me seventy nine
point<00:01:45.600> nine<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.250> pretty<00:01:47.430> confusing

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
point nine now that is pretty confusing

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359 
point nine now that is pretty confusing
because<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.720> could<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.470> keep<00:01:50.040> showing

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
because how could the it keep showing

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.310 
because how could the it keep showing
different<00:01:51.060> results<00:01:51.390> every<00:01:51.720> time<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.079> start

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
different results every time you start

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
different results every time you start
using<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.890> device<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.270> fixing<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
using this device and are then fixing it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.730 
using this device and are then fixing it
at<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.560> specific<00:01:56.100> number<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:56.880> count<00:01:57.380> again<00:01:58.380> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
at one specific number or count again we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.399 
at one specific number or count again we
want<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> test<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.659> tried<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.290> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
want to test this and we tried to do it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.130 
want to test this and we tried to do it
with<00:02:01.439> different<00:02:02.009> people<00:02:02.420> try<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> place<00:02:03.930> some

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
with different people try to place some

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.300 
with different people try to place some
objects<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> didn't<00:02:05.040> work

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
objects but it didn't work

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
objects but it didn't work
so<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:06.210> technically<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> have

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so it's technically if you have

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.139 
so it's technically if you have
something<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.160> which<00:02:08.580> weighs<00:02:08.849> more

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
something which is which weighs more

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420 
something which is which weighs more
than<00:02:09.209> ten<00:02:10.140> cases<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.830> somewhere<00:02:11.099> around<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
than ten cases or somewhere around that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.800 
than ten cases or somewhere around that
that's<00:02:12.000> where<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that's where it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.229 
that's where it
starts<00:02:13.250> detecting<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> weight<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.880> shows

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
starts detecting the weight and shows

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.970 
starts detecting the weight and shows
you<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> results<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> same<00:02:16.140> next<00:02:16.800> step

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you the results of the same next step

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
you the results of the same next step
you<00:02:17.280> need<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.580> also<00:02:17.760> ensure<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.330> have

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you need to also ensure that you have

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.449 
you need to also ensure that you have
the<00:02:18.750> mean<00:02:18.900> scale<00:02:19.170> up<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.650> option<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.430> your

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
the mean scale up the option on your

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.670 
the mean scale up the option on your
meal<00:02:20.790> fit<00:02:21.540> application<00:02:22.140> or<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.470> need<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
meal fit application or you need to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
meal fit application or you need to
download<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.190> same<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:24.120> once<00:02:24.360> you've

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
download the same and then once you've

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
download the same and then once you've
set<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> starts<00:02:26.010> off<00:02:26.130> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
set up this is how you it starts off it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.370 
set up this is how you it starts off it
says<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.640> pair<00:02:26.849> step<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.510> scale<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
says to pair step on to the scale so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020 
says to pair step on to the scale so
once<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.099> screen<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.849> need<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
once you have this screen you need to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.360 
once you have this screen you need to
again<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> your<00:02:31.200> scale<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.739> step<00:02:32.190> on

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
again go back to your scale and step on

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.110 
again go back to your scale and step on
it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.710 

following<00:02:36.120> which<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.390> would<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
following which you would get the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.710 
following which you would get the
notification<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.730> app<00:02:38.970> has<00:02:39.300> perfectly

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
notification that the app has perfectly

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.979 
notification that the app has perfectly
set<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.170> up<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.500> they're<00:02:41.160> here<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.750> first

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
set it up and they're here the first

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.059 
set it up and they're here the first
time<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.200> start<00:02:43.290> using<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.800> would

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
time you start using it you would

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.860 
time you start using it you would
actually<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.550> an<00:02:44.670> update<00:02:45.030> following<00:02:45.720> which

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
actually get an update following which

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.180 
actually get an update following which
it<00:02:46.080> would<00:02:46.200> show<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.590> complete<00:02:46.920> score

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it would show you the complete score

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.979 
it would show you the complete score
again<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.060> best<00:02:48.239> part<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.540> it's

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
again the best part is that it's

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.320 
again the best part is that it's
perfectly<00:02:49.410> able<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.890> recognize<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.090> there

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
perfectly able to recognize that there

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.170 
perfectly able to recognize that there
are<00:02:51.420> different<00:02:51.690> people<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.280> top

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
are different people going on to the top

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.270 
are different people going on to the top
of<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.540> weighing<00:02:55.110> scale<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
of this weighing scale and then it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.890 
of this weighing scale and then it
allows<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.700> add<00:02:56.880> different<00:02:57.269> profiles<00:02:57.660> and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
allows you to add different profiles and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.630 
allows you to add different profiles and
that<00:02:58.319> is<00:02:58.440> pretty<00:02:58.650> interesting<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.310> if

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that is pretty interesting because if

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.160 
that is pretty interesting because if
you<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.819> different<00:03:00.120> family<00:03:00.390> members<00:03:00.720> who

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
you have different family members who

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.530 
you have different family members who
are<00:03:01.319> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.560> use<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.890> scale<00:03:02.519> then<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.330> can

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
are going to use this scale then you can

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.949 
are going to use this scale then you can
always<00:03:03.720> create<00:03:03.989> different<00:03:04.470> profiles<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
always create different profiles and

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.320 
always create different profiles and
start<00:03:06.959> using<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.380> overall<00:03:08.099> after<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.849> descends

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
start using it overall after it descends

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.089 
start using it overall after it descends
the<00:03:09.450> weighing<00:03:09.870> scale<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> would<00:03:10.319> save<00:03:10.650> again

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
the weighing scale I would save again

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.890 
the weighing scale I would save again
it's<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.400> smart<00:03:11.730> weighing<00:03:11.940> scale<00:03:12.180> which<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it's a smart weighing scale which is the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.320 
it's a smart weighing scale which is the
most<00:03:13.080> important<00:03:13.530> factor<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:14.760> wish<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.000> it

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
most important factor but I wish that it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.120 
most important factor but I wish that it
would<00:03:15.510> actually<00:03:15.900> store<00:03:16.709> all<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.100> data

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
would actually store all the data

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.430 
would actually store all the data
offline<00:03:17.670> considering<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.780> would<00:03:18.900> track

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
offline considering that it would track

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.259 
offline considering that it would track
the<00:03:19.470> data<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.100> then<00:03:20.310> ensure<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.670> okay<00:03:21.060> this

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
the data and then ensure that okay this

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.270 
the data and then ensure that okay this
person<00:03:21.720> has<00:03:21.870> climbed<00:03:22.140> onto<00:03:22.380> scale<00:03:22.769> let's

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
person has climbed onto scale let's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.099 
person has climbed onto scale let's
