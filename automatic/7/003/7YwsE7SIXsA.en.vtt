00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.250
 O 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 This is an image made with the next is the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.259
 50 I'm here on the Paulista blog and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.270
 showing a little is how to make 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.740
 You tall shoot actually then here. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 I can make this image because the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.130
 zinho display here can turn me 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.170
 I have a control of what I am. 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.780
 framing up from the top of my head 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.490
 You will cut a little work to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.770
 and the audio you heard from the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.939
 Directional book microphone though 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.579
 have a little noise I think 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.320
 ensures better audio now this audio 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 that you hear there from the internal microphone 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 of the camera just for you to make a difference 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.610
 When we turn off some how 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.030
 stay 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.369
 and now I recorded using this rebel t4 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.289
 go and it 's really cool to use for me 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.549
 report to record a trip 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.530
 something like it has a viewfinder 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.420
 articulating it is easy to see exactly 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.849
 because I'm recording it here when I say it 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.440
 for the camera but the oil can not be trusted 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.510
 only on the internal microphone that is the one 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.069
 you listen to the voice now it's cool you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.019
 use another type of microphone because 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.750
 it captures everything around and the noise should 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.470
 have a lot louder than my voice 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.960
 now i write using lumix and jeff 5 is 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 a really easy lightweight camera really 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.620
 do this kind of shooting thinking a 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.900
 I did not come to play video 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.430
 to book your trips do some 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 It's a joke that works great. 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.970
 well and I'm holding her by the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.680
 true because it has no display 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 articulable besides being unable to see 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.090
 exactly photographing in which the risk 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.520
 touch screen display should do 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.040
 some bullshit and all the cameras that the 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.170
 We already filmed it is delivering its 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.450
 best audio quality in the segment 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.340
 of the compact it preserves the bass and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.709
 really have an audio quality with 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.690
 a good stereo internal microphone 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.880
 now you watch through the lens 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.709
 samsung galaxy wants the network to have 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.170
 camera of the moment white is more 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.690
 of all the cameras it serves 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.489
 very well if I already want subsidy 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.989
 now youtube share on networks 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.360
 because it runs the system 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.110
 android has all the project applications 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.570
 said 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 now with a more professional camera 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.870
 it leaves a little to be desired if you 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.360
 want a social cause 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.230
 she is obliged to cross more professional 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.230
 I think you come sir 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.020
 our turn in the backpack had urban a 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.420
 like this moment with this machine in hand 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.550
 in what is its position herself 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.940
 dreams on the internet where your old 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.940
 province
