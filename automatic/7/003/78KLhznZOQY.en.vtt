 In today's video I bring you the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.550
 Profile daniks mix is a movie with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 the psychic theme and plays a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.949
 control type support in the game 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 place is very fragile and precise. 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 and control their powers to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.120
 to protect in combat their parts are 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.879
 obtained facing floride found 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.950
 in invasions of infested mix has a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 version that in addition to a polarity 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.340
 additional has the armor its version 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 normal 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.500
 the first power of the next is a found 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.719
 no one invades the mind of your enemy 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.399
 causing him to fight alongside the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.160
 toucans for a while 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.289
 Nixon can control one enemy at a time 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.570
 the enemy controlled munich attack 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.809
 themes during this period. 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.729
 damage that he or she suffered from the group is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.780
 accumulated and released at the end of the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 mental 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.610
 time is affected by the duration of power 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.189
 distance affected by the range of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 power 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.979
 the second skill is psyche box links 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 for mental projects that fit your 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.400
 own trajectory to find the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.470
 nearby enemies 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.180
 it is necessary that the targets be in the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 field of view of nicks so that the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 projects enemies meetings the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 obstacle to the environment with barricades or 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 columns do not obstruct the projectiles 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.320
 the owner of this ability is affected by 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.840
 power strength 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 Chock is the third skill daniks 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.590
 nicks uses a psychic explosion to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.740
 confuse and cause hysteria in enemies 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 on the enemy battlefield under the effect 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 of power will attack nearby targets 100 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 two allies or enemies as soon as 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.149
 power is used the affected enemies are 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.009
 disoriented for a short time 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.890
 this power can only be used again 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.020
 its duration lasts or if all 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.629
 the affected enemies were killed 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.260
 time is affected by the duration of power 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.409
 and at a distance by the reach of power 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.900
 the last ability and absorbs nick 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.760
 meditation center absorbing every year 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.530
 received and becoming immune to any type 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.720
 control of enemies 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.030
 it creates a bubble that stores in the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.810
 tank and allies and enemies causes 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.480
 area 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.090
 once activated the power starts to consume 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 energy with time and with the damage that is 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.010
 stored to re-use the power or 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.959
 with the end of your energy 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.870
 no one leaves meditation chooses this 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.810
 bubble releasing the accumulated damage and a 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.609
 an additional power of this kind is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.790
 unable to receive power during the 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:55.200
 meditation be it energy saimon or 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.299
 even attractive range increased radius 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.609
 distance from explosion 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.829
 the strength of power giving base and the power 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.170
 accumulation of enemy damage 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.579
 Now I'll talk a little bit like playing with 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.190
 links 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.349
 As I said attachment is a good femme 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.690
 fragile and can not cause damage 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.150
 massively fast as we saw in the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 video of your new style of play 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.370
 you need a little more patience and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.190
 careful to use your powers more 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.709
 control is excellent for isolating a 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.349
 threat even if the target 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.530
 does not help much in combat is 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.780
 one less opponent punishing his group 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.389
 use more control on targets 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.419
 important as enemies with classes 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.980
 Brazilian environments or heavy 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.049
 broke it has a power that I do not use 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.889
 a lot since you totally prefer 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.540
 unix supportcomm causes power does 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.609
 annex one of the best controls in the game 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.099
 but this comes at a price 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.980
 can not be reused while active 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.780
 Another caution is remembering what causes 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.849
 still allows your enemies to attack 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.730
 in your group since the attack will be in 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.590
 any close target but that's the power 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.629
 that makes nixon one of the best marfrig 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.049
 without the game or those we use 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.090
 in high-level missions 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.159
 absorbs is very interesting and can be 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.680
 used to protect its allies one 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.959
 created can or even you 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.909
 depending on the situation is a power well 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.250
 has a high cost as well. 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.960
 but can eliminate groups of enemies and 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.450
 block paths with ease 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.020
 impressive 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.400
 well this was the profile daniks hope 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.020
 You liked the video and have 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.510
 helped you to know a little more 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.400
 on this greater front remembering that 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.680
 this video does not translate the reality of 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.520
 game is just a style of play 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.290
 My role as a player is passing to you. 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.990
 get now with the build I use on it 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.990
 we see the next and had staff
