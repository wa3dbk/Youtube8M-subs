okay welcome back we have for a Cure and
we<00:00:08.220> have<00:00:08.400> our<00:00:08.639> head<00:00:09.059> controls<00:00:09.540> we<00:00:09.840> can<00:00:09.870> rotate

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
we have our head controls we can rotate

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.940 
we have our head controls we can rotate
this<00:00:10.559> control<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.120> controls<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.920> can

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this control and we have controls we can

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.950 
this control and we have controls we can
do<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> movement<00:00:14.849> from<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.120> eyes<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.809> use

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
do the movement from the eyes we can use

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.170 
do the movement from the eyes we can use
our<00:00:16.170> individual<00:00:16.949> eye<00:00:17.100> control<00:00:17.520> left<00:00:18.000> eye

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
our individual eye control left eye

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
our individual eye control left eye
control<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> right<00:00:18.900> eye<00:00:18.930> control<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.949> can

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
control and right eye control and we can

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.029 
control and right eye control and we can
do<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.369> scaling<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.480> out

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039

you want something happy I've gone ahead
and<00:00:35.520> sculpt<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.239> expressions<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.380> pro

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and sculpt some expressions for like pro

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
and sculpt some expressions for like pro
text<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> surprise<00:00:38.879> said<00:00:39.210> uh<00:00:39.480> blah<00:00:39.840> blah<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
text and surprise said uh blah blah and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.119 
text and surprise said uh blah blah and
they<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.950> quick

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
they are not very good it's just a quick

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
they are not very good it's just a quick
test<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.390> say<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.840> angry<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.590> have

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
test but like say for angry we can have

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
test but like say for angry we can have
this<00:00:46.860> star<00:00:47.100> shaped<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.489> angry<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.809> then

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this star shaped like angry and then

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
this star shaped like angry and then
squashed<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.920> squash<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:51.329> others

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
squashed we can squash and some others

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
squashed we can squash and some others
here<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.219> show<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> guys<00:00:54.000> how<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
here and so I can show you guys how to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
here and so I can show you guys how to
use<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:55.079> rake<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> simple

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
use this little rake to do a simple

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.660 
use this little rake to do a simple
simple<00:00:57.180> simple<00:00:57.590> animation<00:00:58.590> maybe<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.520> want<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
simple simple animation maybe we want to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.920 
simple simple animation maybe we want to
just<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.329> hit<00:01:00.510> turn

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
just do some hit turn

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.109 
just do some hit turn
so<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.320> set<00:01:01.590> by<00:01:01.670> creating<00:01:02.670> subsection<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
so that's set by creating subsection is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.399 
so that's set by creating subsection is
actually<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.780> section<00:01:07.170> set

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
actually only get one section set

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
actually only get one section set
because<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> present<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.119> animation<00:01:09.630> we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
because it's a present or animation we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
because it's a present or animation we
can<00:01:10.260> select<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:10.860> head<00:01:11.040> control<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.610> eye

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
can select them head control our eye

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.609 
can select them head control our eye
control<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.930> individual<00:01:13.500> eye

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
control and this to individual eye

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.060 
control and this to individual eye
controls<00:01:14.130> create<00:01:15.060> set<00:01:15.930> quick<00:01:16.409> selection<00:01:16.860> set

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
controls create set quick selection set

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.520 
controls create set quick selection set
and<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.430> call<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.729> gain<00:01:18.180> underscore<00:01:18.840> two<00:01:19.080> SS

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and we call it gain underscore two SS

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
and we call it gain underscore two SS
and<00:01:19.799> added<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> shelf<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> what<00:01:21.900> happens

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and added to the shelf so what happens

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
and added to the shelf so what happens
is<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.650> shelf<00:01:23.130> button<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.659> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
is we have a shelf button now that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.899 
is we have a shelf button now that
selects<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.619> four<00:01:26.070> controls<00:01:28.340> or<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.700> can

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
selects all four controls or we can

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.850 
selects all four controls or we can
click<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.390> construction<00:01:31.170> set<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.710> press

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
click on this construction set and press

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.899 
click on this construction set and press
down<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.400> select<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.759> four

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
down when you're select all four

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
down when you're select all four
controls<00:01:33.320> these<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.590> duplicates<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
controls these are not duplicates of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.030 
controls these are not duplicates of
them<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.720> object<00:01:37.049> itself<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.860> an

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
them the object itself is just an

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
them the object itself is just an
instruction<00:01:38.640> mode<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.479> click<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
instruction mode you can click on it and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.500 
instruction mode you can click on it and
select

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
select

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.900 
select
so<00:01:40.630> let's<00:01:40.930> begin<00:01:41.290> select<00:01:42.010> our<00:01:42.160> head

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
so let's begin select our head

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.240 
so let's begin select our head
controller<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:44.080> then<00:01:44.320> set<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> key<00:01:44.800> hold<00:01:45.100> it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
controller and then set a key hold it

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.570 
controller and then set a key hold it
for<00:01:45.490> maybe<00:01:45.730> eight<00:01:46.150> seven<00:01:46.750> eight<00:01:46.840> frames<00:01:47.520> set<00:01:48.520> a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
for maybe eight seven eight frames set a

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.970 
for maybe eight seven eight frames set a
key<00:01:48.850> as<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.150> turns<00:01:49.860> eight<00:01:50.860> five<00:01:51.190> frames<00:01:52.980> and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
key as it turns eight five frames and

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.560 
key as it turns eight five frames and
then<00:01:54.880> we<00:01:55.660> hold<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.200> another<00:01:56.290> eight<00:01:56.860> weeks

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
then we hold it for another eight weeks

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.820 
then we hold it for another eight weeks
so<00:01:58.570> it's<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.960> key<00:02:00.000> key<00:02:01.000> key<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.990> then<00:02:02.350> key<00:02:02.620> so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
so it's a key key key and then key so

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.230 
so it's a key key key and then key so
these<00:02:03.010> two<00:02:03.160> are<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> same<00:02:03.550> destroy<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.060> same

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
these two are the same destroy the same

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.210 
these two are the same destroy the same
and<00:02:04.450> then<00:02:04.660> there's<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:05.020> transition<00:02:05.350> here<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
and then there's a transition here and

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.340 
and then there's a transition here and
then<00:02:06.400> we<00:02:06.520> want<00:02:06.730> some<00:02:06.880> dip<00:02:07.150> in<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.450> head<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:07.870> we

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
then we want some dip in the head so we

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.950 
then we want some dip in the head so we
can<00:02:08.380> tell<00:02:08.680> over<00:02:08.920> art<00:02:09.250> or<00:02:09.580> underarm<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.570> just<00:02:10.869> to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
can tell over art or underarm so just to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.710 
can tell over art or underarm so just to
do<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> underarms<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.430> goes<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:13.690> this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
do the underarms so it goes like this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530 
do the underarms so it goes like this
but<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:14.770> don't<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.280> fully<00:02:15.580> stop<00:02:16.000> motion

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
but we don't want a fully stop motion

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.100 
but we don't want a fully stop motion
here<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.320> we<00:02:17.970> copy<00:02:18.970> our<00:02:19.300> friend<00:02:19.600> eleven<00:02:19.960> to

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
here so we copy our friend eleven to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.780 
here so we copy our friend eleven to
print<00:02:20.350> off<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.070> get<00:02:21.280> some<00:02:21.550> kind<00:02:21.700> of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
print off so that we get some kind of

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.730 
print off so that we get some kind of
moving<00:02:22.120> over<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.110> too<00:02:23.290> much<00:02:23.470> we<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
moving over here it is too much we can

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.950 
moving over here it is too much we can
take<00:02:23.890> 15<00:02:24.250> at<00:02:24.700> 12<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.210> then<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.540> have<00:02:25.690> some<00:02:25.930> kind

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
take 15 at 12 and then we have some kind

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.260 
take 15 at 12 and then we have some kind
of<00:02:26.200> moving<00:02:26.380> hole<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.880> doesn't<00:02:28.150> look

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
of moving hole here so it doesn't look

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.310 
of moving hole here so it doesn't look
to<00:02:28.540> day<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.500> whole<00:02:29.680> after<00:02:30.370> 30<00:02:31.320> and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
to day but it's a whole after 30 and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.470 
to day but it's a whole after 30 and
then<00:02:32.590> over<00:02:33.220> here<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.700> full<00:02:33.970> hold

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
then over here it's a full hold

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.410 
then over here it's a full hold
so<00:02:34.630> I'll<00:02:34.780> take<00:02:35.140> frame<00:02:35.380> 9<00:02:35.760> copy<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.030> frame<00:02:37.240> 8

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
so I'll take frame 9 copy it to frame 8

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.240 
so I'll take frame 9 copy it to frame 8
and<00:02:37.690> that's<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.930> moving<00:02:38.110> hold<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:38.890> too

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and that's a moving hold but this is too

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.910 
and that's a moving hold but this is too
much<00:02:39.280> not<00:02:39.850> too<00:02:40.030> much<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.390> hole<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.590> think

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
much not too much of a hole so I think

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.280 
much not too much of a hole so I think
maybe<00:02:42.280> frame<00:02:42.610> four<00:02:43.120> or<00:02:43.360> five<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.900> thirty<00:02:44.140> to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
maybe frame four or five and thirty to

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.270 
maybe frame four or five and thirty to
three<00:02:44.410> months<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:48.930> get<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.959> process<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:51.190> if

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
three months what get the process so if

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.840 
three months what get the process so if
it<00:02:51.370> goes<00:02:51.490> down<00:02:53.070> over<00:02:54.070> here<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.490> your<00:02:54.640> friend

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
it goes down over here with your friend

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.560 
it goes down over here with your friend
line<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.650> call<00:02:57.300> individual<00:02:58.300> controls

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
line we can call individual controls

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.420 
line we can call individual controls
let's<00:03:01.570> just<00:03:01.840> run<00:03:02.020> through<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.739> main<00:03:02.920> keys<00:03:03.190> and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
let's just run through the main keys and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.840 
let's just run through the main keys and
just<00:03:03.489> set<00:03:03.850> up<00:03:04.000> empty<00:03:04.330> keyframe<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:04.870> all<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
just set up empty keyframe on all of the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.500 
just set up empty keyframe on all of the
channels<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.160> our<00:03:09.280> keys<00:03:09.520> here<00:03:09.760> so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
channels so we have our keys here so

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.440 
channels so we have our keys here so
this<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.890> main<00:03:12.160> part<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.940> think<00:03:13.180> so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
this is the main part of the think so

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.380 
this is the main part of the think so
maybe<00:03:13.630> down<00:03:14.140> here<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.590> would<00:03:14.739> be<00:03:14.770> fully<00:03:15.070> closed

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
maybe down here it would be fully closed

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.020 
maybe down here it would be fully closed
like<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.870> we<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:20.050> so<00:03:20.200> maybe<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:21.580> takes<00:03:21.820> one

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
like this we and so maybe it takes one

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.070 
like this we and so maybe it takes one
thing<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.420> close<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.110> more<00:03:23.440> friends<00:03:23.740> to<00:03:23.800> open

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
thing to close and more friends to open

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.920 
thing to close and more friends to open
so<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.710> one<00:03:27.520> frame<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.880> close<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.540> they

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
so it's like one frame to close and they

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.930 
so it's like one frame to close and they
hold<00:03:29.200> for<00:03:29.410> two<00:03:29.530> frames<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.160> then<00:03:30.250> opens<00:03:30.730> in

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
hold for two frames and then opens in

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.090 
hold for two frames and then opens in
Toulouse<00:03:31.330> so<00:03:32.140> there's<00:03:32.440> no<00:03:32.590> hard<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:32.980> fast

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
Toulouse so there's no hard and fast

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.210 
Toulouse so there's no hard and fast
rule<00:03:33.520> on<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:34.060> just<00:03:34.830> just<00:03:35.830> because<00:03:36.100> we

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
rule on this is just just because we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.850 
rule on this is just just because we
don't<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.490> any<00:03:36.640> context<00:03:37.240> here<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:40.980> what<00:03:43.860> so

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
don't have any context here so what so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.670 
don't have any context here so what so
maybe<00:03:45.100> after<00:03:45.400> what<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.270> what<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.140> can<00:03:47.560> be

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
maybe after what and what I can be

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.150 
maybe after what and what I can be
bigger<00:03:48.100> than<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.459> other<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:50.110> just<00:03:50.590> turn<00:03:50.860> this

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.610 

you<00:03:54.160> get<00:03:54.370> some<00:03:54.550> interest<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.239> I'll<00:03:56.170> copy<00:03:56.410> this

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
you get some interest and I'll copy this

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.870 
you get some interest and I'll copy this
range<00:03:56.950> here<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.950> then<00:03:59.950> maybe<00:04:00.130> after<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.730> it

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
range here and then maybe after this it

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.300 
range here and then maybe after this it
gets<00:04:01.030> angry<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:08.110> let's<00:04:08.650> take<00:04:08.770> on<00:04:08.890> all<00:04:09.070> four

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
gets angry so let's take on all four

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.830 
gets angry so let's take on all four
controls<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:11.709> have<00:04:11.739> help<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.700> this<00:04:13.570> long

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
controls we have help this for this long

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.159 
controls we have help this for this long
and<00:04:14.410> then<00:04:15.150> we'll<00:04:16.150> get<00:04:16.480> angry<00:04:16.840> now

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
and then we'll get angry now

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.909 
and then we'll get angry now
and<00:04:17.260> we<00:04:18.390> sulfate<00:04:19.390> 33<00:04:19.989> we'll<00:04:20.320> turn<00:04:20.530> this<00:04:20.709> to

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
and we sulfate 33 we'll turn this to

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:30.140 
and we sulfate 33 we'll turn this to
angry

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.200 

of<00:04:30.750> course<00:04:30.960> medieval<00:04:31.380> hit<00:04:31.560> dip<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.699> maybe<00:04:33.240> this

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.920 

maybe<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.330> movement<00:04:39.990> down<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.470> too<00:04:40.650> much<00:04:41.930> we

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
maybe that movement down is too much we

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.450 
maybe that movement down is too much we
want<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.169> be<00:04:43.320> careful<00:04:43.650> with<00:04:44.010> this<00:04:44.190> kind<00:04:44.430> of

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
want to be careful with this kind of

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.010 
want to be careful with this kind of
things<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:47.030> off<00:04:48.030> across<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.360> movement<00:04:48.870> down

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
things and off across the movement down

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.290 
things and off across the movement down
it's<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.500> after<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.520> holds<00:04:50.910> all<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.180> way

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
it's a after this it holds all the way

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.879 
it's a after this it holds all the way
from<00:04:51.510> 50<00:04:51.780> frames<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.199> we<00:04:52.350> don't<00:04:52.560> want<00:04:52.770> that

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
from 50 frames so we don't want that

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.400 
from 50 frames so we don't want that
maybe<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.790> next<00:04:53.820> 8<00:04:54.270> frames<00:04:54.570> or<00:04:54.960> 10<00:04:55.290> frames

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
maybe for the next 8 frames or 10 frames

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.280 
maybe for the next 8 frames or 10 frames
or<00:04:56.120> whatever<00:04:57.120> we<00:04:57.360> need<00:04:57.389> get<00:04:57.810> some<00:04:57.990> kind<00:04:58.199> of

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
or whatever we need get some kind of

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.390 
or whatever we need get some kind of
moving<00:04:58.470> home<00:04:59.990> we're<00:05:00.990> gonna<00:05:01.080> take<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:02.130> frame

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
moving home we're gonna take this frame

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.990 
moving home we're gonna take this frame
22<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.419> you<00:05:03.510> get<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.780> 10<00:05:03.960> seconds<00:05:04.350> so

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
22 and you get to 10 seconds so

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.719 
22 and you get to 10 seconds so
gradually<00:05:06.000> goes<00:05:06.210> down<00:05:06.510> it's<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.110> whole<00:05:07.320> but

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
gradually goes down it's a whole but

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:18.379 
gradually goes down it's a whole but
subtle<00:05:08.729> but<00:05:08.910> moving<00:05:09.630> whole<00:05:09.810> community<00:05:17.389> and

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
subtle but moving whole community and

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:19.939 
subtle but moving whole community and
after<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.690> goes<00:05:18.840> down<00:05:19.080> maybe<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.440> intensity

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
after it goes down maybe the intensity

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.620 
after it goes down maybe the intensity
here<00:05:20.280> I<00:05:20.310> can<00:05:20.520> increase<00:05:21.139> we<00:05:22.139> have<00:05:23.630> problem

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
here I can increase we have problem

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.810 
here I can increase we have problem
perplex<00:05:25.350> control<00:05:25.830> which<00:05:26.220> controls<00:05:26.400> the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
perplex control which controls the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.250 
perplex control which controls the
bottom<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:27.449> we<00:05:27.570> can<00:05:27.690> actually<00:05:27.870> call<00:05:28.139> this

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
bottom that so we can actually call this

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.500 
bottom that so we can actually call this
bottom<00:05:28.620> bit<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.130> make<00:05:29.910> this<00:05:30.090> kind<00:05:30.419> of

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
bottom bit and make this kind of

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.370 
bottom bit and make this kind of
movement<00:05:30.750> or<00:05:31.440> I'm<00:05:31.800> angry<00:05:31.979> I'm<00:05:32.310> angry<00:05:33.169> so<00:05:34.169> it

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
movement or I'm angry I'm angry so it

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:46.050 
movement or I'm angry I'm angry so it
goes<00:05:34.560> down

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:06:31.240 

super<00:05:47.060> sir<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:52.160> then<00:05:56.110> GTA<00:05:57.110> here<00:06:29.800> so<00:06:30.800> maybe<00:06:31.039> you

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
super sir and then GTA here so maybe you

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.589 
super sir and then GTA here so maybe you
can<00:06:31.430> get<00:06:31.580> a<00:06:31.639> little<00:06:31.909> bit<00:06:32.120> of<00:06:32.270> a<00:06:32.300> vibration<00:06:34.599> too

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
can get a little bit of a vibration too

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.940 
can get a little bit of a vibration too
much

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.000 

so<00:06:42.520> turns<00:06:42.850> left<00:06:43.180> with<00:06:43.480> it<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:44.140> maybe<00:06:44.590> right<00:06:44.980> a

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
so turns left with it and maybe right a

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.890 
so turns left with it and maybe right a
little<00:06:45.340> bit<00:06:48.240> and<00:06:49.240> of<00:06:49.360> course<00:06:49.600> it<00:06:49.720> shouldn't

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
little bit and of course it shouldn't

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.450 
little bit and of course it shouldn't
move<00:06:50.110> as<00:06:50.320> fast<00:06:50.500> as<00:06:50.710> the<00:06:50.830> I'd<00:06:50.980> yeah<00:06:51.310> it's

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
move as fast as the I'd yeah it's

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.890 
move as fast as the I'd yeah it's
smaller<00:06:51.760> the<00:06:52.030> head<00:06:52.150> is<00:06:52.270> bigger<00:06:52.570> so<00:06:52.870> I

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
smaller the head is bigger so I

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.010 
smaller the head is bigger so I
shouldn't<00:06:53.770> go<00:06:53.950> too<00:06:54.100> fast<00:06:54.400> all<00:06:54.970> right<00:06:55.270> going<00:06:55.810> to

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
shouldn't go too fast all right going to

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:02.490 
shouldn't go too fast all right going to
frenzy<00:06:57.180> maybe<00:06:58.180> earlier<00:07:00.900> so<00:07:01.900> it<00:07:01.990> looks<00:07:02.230> and

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
frenzy maybe earlier so it looks and

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.610 
frenzy maybe earlier so it looks and
they<00:07:02.620> get<00:07:02.890> some<00:07:03.070> really<00:07:03.250> angry<00:07:03.520> so<00:07:07.320> so<00:07:08.320> that's

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
they get some really angry so so that's

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.770 
they get some really angry so so that's
it<00:07:08.830> we've<00:07:09.130> created<00:07:09.400> an<00:07:09.700> rig<00:07:09.910> from<00:07:10.060> scratch<00:07:10.480> and

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
it we've created an rig from scratch and

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.130 
it we've created an rig from scratch and
we<00:07:10.990> have<00:07:11.220> the<00:07:12.220> 2d<00:07:12.970> eirick<00:07:13.330> that<00:07:13.720> we<00:07:13.810> can<00:07:13.990> use

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
we have the 2d eirick that we can use

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.530 
we have the 2d eirick that we can use
for<00:07:14.350> simple<00:07:14.740> characters<00:07:15.370> like<00:07:15.550> this<00:07:15.730> and<00:07:15.970> make

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:16.540 
for simple characters like this and make

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.110 
for simple characters like this and make
some<00:07:16.690> simple<00:07:17.050> animation<00:07:17.530> so<00:07:17.800> so<00:07:18.760> maybe<00:07:18.970> I'll

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
some simple animation so so maybe I'll

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.030 
some simple animation so so maybe I'll
just<00:07:19.390> like<00:07:19.660> this<00:07:19.930> in<00:07:20.170> and<00:07:20.350> just<00:07:20.560> render<00:07:20.860> it<00:07:20.950> out

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
just like this in and just render it out

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.070 
just like this in and just render it out
so<00:07:21.310> that<00:07:21.340> you<00:07:21.460> guys<00:07:21.640> can<00:07:21.880> see<00:07:22.060> what's<00:07:22.870> the

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
so that you guys can see what's the

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.560 
so that you guys can see what's the
final<00:07:23.410> look<00:07:23.680> of<00:07:24.340> this<00:07:24.490> animation<00:07:25.060> so<00:07:25.300> I<00:07:25.330> just

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570 
final look of this animation so I just

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.690 
final look of this animation so I just
made<00:07:25.690> a<00:07:25.720> quick<00:07:26.050> render<00:07:26.650> and<00:07:26.890> you<00:07:27.040> can<00:07:27.250> see<00:07:27.490> what

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700 
made a quick render and you can see what

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.870 
made a quick render and you can see what
it<00:07:27.820> looks<00:07:27.970> like<00:07:28.060> then<00:07:29.130> yeah<00:07:30.130> that's<00:07:30.580> all<00:07:30.850> I

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 
it looks like then yeah that's all I
