 in account in my name is mariana ellena 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.250
 I got up with a desire to cook 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.570
 something like with chocolate and cookies in 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.490
 change love these types of desserts 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.320

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.260
 who is now very rich to really 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.300
 It is delicious and they are not so fast 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.710
 but you can meet with your boyfriend with 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.329
 your friends to do it and the truth is that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.499
 it's super rich what they like a lot 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.030
 this video I did it with a lot of love 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.300
 for you I hope they do 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.890
 obviously and well let's start 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 the first thing you will do is the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.750
 marshmallow for this you need 3 cups 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.540
 of sugar 2 containers with 3 quarters of 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.820
 water a bowl with sugar glass 4 packages 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.559
 of unflavored gelatine 2 teaspoons 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.260
 vanilla extract a quarter 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.950
 teaspoon of salt and a quarter cup 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.080
 of corn syrup 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.000
 you are going to put in a bowl three quarters of 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.530
 water and the four sachets of gelatin 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 no flavor and well this we are going to leave 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.000
 set aside for a while now in a pot 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.250
 you are going to add sugar and syrup 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.780
 corn you will stir it until it takes and 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.260
 well, little by little, you're going to realize 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.260
 change 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.630
 we also have to add the salt and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.630
 three quarts of water 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.930
 now it revolves very well until 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.930
 boil 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.760
 Now with the first thing we did, we're going to 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
 start beating at a low speed per 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.600
 12 minutes is adding the mixture of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 second step and little by little it is increasing 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.050
 the speed at the end you have to 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.050
 look like toothpaste 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.930
 if not 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 never 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.310
 ah 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.000
 ah 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000
 to 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.560
 once you have stayed like this what 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.000
 you have to do is pass it to a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 I recommend that you 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.310
 Put waxed paper so you do not get 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.310
 go to paste anything 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.300
 when it's ready, we 're going to put it in 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.300
 refrigerator for three hours 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.549
 and now comes my favorite part that is 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.620
 make the cookies for this you need 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.840
 a three-quarter cup of flour a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.120
 honey quarter one third of 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.030
 a third muscovado sugar flour 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.280
 all use half a teaspoon of salt a 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.840
 teaspoon vanilla extract three 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.810
 quarts of teaspoon of powder for 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.609
 bake half a teaspoon of baking 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.129
 six tablespoons of butter two 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.200
 spoonfuls of milk a spoonful with 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.569
 orange juice and a teaspoon of 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.220
 cinnamon and obviously some cutters 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.530
 cookie 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.630
 add a bowl of dry ingredients 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.220
 and mix the very very well until the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.220
 ingredients are well incorporated 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.040
 when it has stayed like this add the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.110
 butter and now you're going to have to use 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.110
 your hands to knead this super well 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.250
 and now you will have to add the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.250
 liquid ingredients 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.120
 when you're done, make a little ball with 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.590
 all your mass and they 're going to stop it 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.590
 refrigerator for 30 minutes 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.629
 this step I love let's cut 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.629
 our cookies 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.560
 what I did was cut some cookies 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.449
 in a big heart shape and then with 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.020
 a smaller cutter I removed the center 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.020
 from my heart 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.139
 at the time of doing this I recommend you 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.090
 that also use is the waxed paper 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.919
 because if you're not going to hit everything and not 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.919
 is going to leave you then use 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.690
 first the big heart will happen 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.190
 very carefully to a tray with 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.480
 waxed paper and that's where we're going to 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.480
 cut our little heart 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.730
 and when you have made the cookies that you 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.120
 we'll want to put in the oven 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.120
 10 minutes 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.960
 put icing sugar on a board and there you go 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.129
 to cut your marshmallow as if they were 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.080
 cookies 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.849
 and good if you want to perfect them 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.330
 like me with the help of a knife what 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.330
 you can do 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.439
 you're going to realize that the marshmallow is going 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.780
 to be slightly stuck to the cutter 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:42.099
 cookie then add it to the icing sugar and 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.099
 it will be easier to remove it 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.210
 by the way do not forget the cookies 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.900
 but once you are ready to take them out and 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.900
 let them cool 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.039
 so he would know richer and be more 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.530
 easy to put together our sandwichitos 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.419
 decide to melt chocolate in a bain marie 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.889
 to be made delicious and good 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.270
 this step if you do not want to do it 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.990
 it matters nothing happens but I'll 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.990
 I recommend that you do it 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.790
 they do not know how delicious this is 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.500
 dessert I loved it you can 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.210
 Share with your friends with your 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.400
 brothers with your teachers with your 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.750
 grandparents with anyone and as 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.340
 They may see me were huge 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.280
 then I think that this heart I'm going 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.960
 to share with someone special but you 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.460
 you can see them more little ones is more up 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.800
 you can change the figure this nothing more 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.760
 of an example to give you an idea and 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.760
 if you like me to do it 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.460
 and ready is all you have to do 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.290
 I really loved how 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.330
 they were look super nice they put on 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.860
 come back from the fans with a bow tie or 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.660
 anything the truth I think that 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.450
 They are perfect to give and share 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.490
 with someone special and obviously the most 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.260
 important is that they are delicious and 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.550
 good if you want to give them a chocolate 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.990
 do not worry about this recipe that the 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.600
 you can use to do anything else 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.120
 biscuits but really this is very 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.010
 rich 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.690
