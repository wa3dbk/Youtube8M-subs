00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
hey guys welcome back to Falcons RC

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.049 
hey guys welcome back to Falcons RC
basically<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.010> only<00:00:11.070> modification<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.880> have

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
basically the only modification I have

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.480 
basically the only modification I have
to<00:00:12.179> do<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:13.290> put<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> stick<00:00:14.009> over<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to do to it was put a stick over here a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
to do to it was put a stick over here a
popsicle<00:00:15.089> stick<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> nose<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.139> bang<00:00:17.070> on

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
popsicle stick on the nose and bang on

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
popsicle stick on the nose and bang on
the<00:00:17.279> back<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.910> reinforce<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:19.230> Tindra

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the back to reinforce that little Tindra

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.990 
the back to reinforce that little Tindra
there<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:19.920> he<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.130> too<00:00:20.310> weak<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.699> he<00:00:20.820> was

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
there because he was too weak and he was

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
there because he was too weak and he was
very<00:00:21.270> loose<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.859> popsicle

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
very loose and now with this popsicle

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.189 
very loose and now with this popsicle
stick<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.880> actually<00:00:24.269> easier<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
stick it's actually easier to get the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.259 
stick it's actually easier to get the
cut<00:00:25.410> bit<00:00:25.590> off<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.640> magnets<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
cut bit off because this magnets are

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
cut bit off because this magnets are
very<00:00:27.480> strong<00:00:27.810> guys<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.710> trap<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
very strong guys and they trap it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.820 
very strong guys and they trap it
basically<00:00:29.429> blends<00:00:29.820> very<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.570> nice<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
basically blends very very nice with the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.620 
basically blends very very nice with the
fuselage<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:32.850> very<00:00:33.180> hard<00:00:33.300> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
fuselage so it's actually very hard to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.490 
fuselage so it's actually very hard to
try<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> out

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
try to get it out

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380 
try to get it out
just<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.920> your<00:00:35.040> hands<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:36.300> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
just with your hands and this thing is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.639 
just with your hands and this thing is
very<00:00:36.420> weak<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.079> don't<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
very weak so you don't really want to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
very weak so you don't really want to
break<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> popsicle<00:00:39.360> stick<00:00:39.510> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
break it so now with a popsicle stick is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.709 
break it so now with a popsicle stick is
actually<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.950> easy<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.340> pop<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.329> get

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
actually pretty easy use pop off and get

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.840 
actually pretty easy use pop off and get
to<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.670> battery

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to your you know to your battery

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.250 
to your you know to your battery
basically<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> only<00:00:45.840> thing<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.110> have

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
basically that was the only thing I have

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
basically that was the only thing I have
to<00:00:46.350> modify<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.050> some

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to modify in it you know there is some

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
to modify in it you know there is some
guys<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.520> saying

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
guys out there they are they are saying

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
guys out there they are they are saying
that<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.030> better<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.420> fly<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.379> sell<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that is better to fly it we sell the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
that is better to fly it we sell the
drop<00:00:53.039> tanks<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.300> they

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
drop tanks because that because they

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
drop tanks because that because they
break<00:00:54.660> off<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.350> plane<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:55.739> much<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
break off the plane too much but I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
break off the plane too much but I
decided<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.300> leave<00:00:57.539> them<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.719> guys<00:00:58.050> even<00:00:58.680> if

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
decided to leave them there guys even if

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
decided to leave them there guys even if
I<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> glue<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.520> from<00:00:59.910> time<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I have to glue them back from time to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
I have to glue them back from time to
time<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:01.440> actually<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> think

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
time you know because actually I think

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.529 
time you know because actually I think
they<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.340> protecting<00:01:02.850> themselves<00:01:03.059> rather

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
they are protecting themselves rather

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
they are protecting themselves rather
you<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.229> sticking<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you see they are sticking out from the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
you see they are sticking out from the
bottom<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.390> room<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> lend

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
bottom of the other room and if you lend

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
bottom of the other room and if you lend
to<00:01:07.710> her<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.490> probably<00:01:08.700> break<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to her and you can probably break one of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
to her and you can probably break one of
your<00:01:09.360> service<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.070> better<00:01:11.189> if

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
your service or I think it's better if

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
your service or I think it's better if
you<00:01:11.520> leave<00:01:11.670> them<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.880> place<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.630> okay

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you leave them in place you know okay

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
you leave them in place you know okay
guys<00:01:13.619> let's<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> fly<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.610> thing

hey guys you had a part now somewhere in
Warner<00:01:21.930> Robins<00:01:22.430> Georgia<00:01:23.870> is<00:01:24.870> actually<00:01:25.320> a

Warner Robins Georgia is actually a
soccer<00:01:25.830> field<00:01:26.270> looks<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.510> gonna<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.690> a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
want to get a nice landing but I think I

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.910 
want to get a nice landing but I think I
choose<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> bad<00:03:36.930> day<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.140> come<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.620> part

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
choose a bad day to come to this part

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.980 
choose a bad day to come to this part
because<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.850> wound<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.150> very<00:03:39.180> rough<00:03:39.750> right

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
now so it's hard to kind of glide the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.770 
now so it's hard to kind of glide the
skin<00:03:43.080> down<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.430> we're<00:03:44.970> gonna<00:03:45.090> give<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.360> try
