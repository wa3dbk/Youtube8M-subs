that<00:04:23.470> way<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:24.630> it's<00:04:25.630> yeah

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
that way and it's yeah

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.790

think<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.250> have<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> right<00:04:28.640> to<00:04:28.880> make<00:04:29.060> gay<00:04:29.270> jokes

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
think you have a right to make gay jokes

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.690 
think you have a right to make gay jokes
when<00:04:29.840> your<00:04:29.990> name<00:04:30.140> is<00:04:30.260> Tracy<00:04:32.500> personally<00:04:33.700> but

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
when your name is Tracy personally but

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.640 
when your name is Tracy personally but
anyway<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:35.630> think<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.200> seems<00:04:36.380> pretty

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
anyway I think that it seems pretty

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.060 
anyway I think that it seems pretty
hateful<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.280> seems<00:04:37.520> pretty<00:04:37.880> unfriendly<00:04:38.390> and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
hateful and seems pretty unfriendly and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.830 
hateful and seems pretty unfriendly and
so<00:04:40.070> Tracy<00:04:40.400> Morgan<00:04:40.820> did<00:04:40.970> apologize<00:04:41.510> for<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.810> I

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
so Tracy Morgan did apologize for that I

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.360 
so Tracy Morgan did apologize for that I
think<00:04:41.960> it's<00:04:42.170> only<00:04:42.290> fair<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.590> share<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:43.070> part

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
think it's only fair to share that part

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.310 
think it's only fair to share that part
of<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.550> story<00:04:43.730> he<00:04:44.270> says<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.630> want<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.870> apologize

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320
