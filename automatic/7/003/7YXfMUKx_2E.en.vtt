 the stake good memories the first roles tailor-made for a way out of the crisis 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.829
 becomes ridiculous 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:12.049
 and I play at most with the merchants for which I have a lot of 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.109
 2010 we get a lot of emotion 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.730
 because if there was a triptych 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.199
 another Belgian symbolist 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.769
 which I would like a lot 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.589
 but sales have increased for a salary to vary from all vehicles 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.060
 have installed the good it was a bit high 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.489
 but jean-michel bÃ©lot 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.100
 while the report of the UN I'm sorry it's too expensive michel ceruti 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.040
 original rugby 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.960
 assessed the cost of strikes she advises against mallie law 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 one of the three nutrients and the different workshops 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
 and then to the war memorial of more than 70 dead 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 I bought this team in three places like this 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.410
 a kind of credit like that over a few months 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.350
 what nature could serve as a tool has not had a very brussels call 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.100
 critical 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 happily then June 12 in iran where they will join 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.560
 I only know this one was 15 years old 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.170
 I see that I publish for a long time it was a final famous singers 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.430
 I will not tell you who it is but the great famous singer 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.920
 and he is obviously very passionate 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.430
 they want quotas they were six and he looks at the charts from the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.360
 four corners of quebec they can together discuss visited several months 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.090
 that November 19 builder 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 to know more I know that I can count 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.430
 and then I read white by committing a lot forget locator and because 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 dad is largely on their means 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.140
 from the board even sure that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.020
 in the township but I found so no wonder that a boy from 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.049
 15 years they are inhabited by this passion of what will be more than a thing 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.110
 that I saw very special conditions 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.580
 we see that we are a little atypical I am lost it was general 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.120
 I started doing ads that they had nothing to do with restraint 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.970
 both formations 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.980
 right of caux and third type of management 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.410
 and I worked for 22 years in the field of advertising publicis se 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.940
 cut off sun 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 to finish as director of the national network of 8 6% 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.450
 while doing studies that had nothing to do but while 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.899
 being advertising 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.299
 I advise you to go for a ride I think to collect I make 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:12.909
 things 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:13.939
 not terrible 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.339
 I started buying things say we had fifteen years 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.479
 and then your collection besides the fact 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.509
 more between the most diligent 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:28.839
 around piranese defend their disfavor 18th 18th drawings when 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.939
 I was still a student 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.229
 she also proposes sub-prefects cease 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.329
 and that's why except that you allow to start production 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.219
 and so all the time by undoing very different beginning at the day is 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.229
 come corvo completely healed but I wanted advertisers and for 17 years 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.879
 I thought we had quoted 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.700
 and soon 40 years old I thought that in advertising it's not 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.929
 always very good 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.619
 and then I want to realize this old dream so the advertising banners and 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.699
 I opened this war is so in 1186 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:03.309

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.919

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.190

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.850
 the five members of the steering committee of the normal higher activity of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.339
 Paris 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.669
 short forms 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.709
 a painter defend before signing 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.829
 b we attach and that the famous regular potion to reproduce 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.279
