00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
was pretty skeptical I was hoping that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.400 
was pretty skeptical I was hoping that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
maybe I didn't get the same body or they

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.880 
maybe I didn't get the same body or they
had<00:01:01.680> somehow<00:01:02.640> maybe<00:01:03.300> recalled<00:01:03.810> it<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.799> out

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890

had somehow maybe recalled it in put out
new<00:01:05.070> ones<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.480> looked<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.870> it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930

it<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.330> remoulded<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.620> was<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

buckets<00:02:28.739> three<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.830> them<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.129> each<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.640> create

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
buckets three of them in each to create

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.690 
buckets three of them in each to create
some<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.720> custom<00:02:32.170> look<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> truck<00:02:32.920> so
