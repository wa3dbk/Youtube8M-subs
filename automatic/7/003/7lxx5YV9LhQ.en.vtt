00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
into any big hail I think most people

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.560 
into any big hail I think most people
here<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.619> East<00:01:11.770> Coast<00:01:12.039> don't<00:01:12.820> understand<00:01:13.300> what

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.140 
hit you on the head and they have that
stuff<00:01:17.770> out<00:01:17.979> there<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.549> little<00:01:18.790> concerned

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
stuff out there so I a little concerned

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.719 
stuff out there so I a little concerned
about<00:01:19.479> that<00:01:20.260> hopefully<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.950> weather<00:01:21.100> doesn't

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
about that hopefully the weather doesn't

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.500 
about that hopefully the weather doesn't
play<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:21.970> big<00:01:22.180> factor<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.729> 75<00:01:24.729> or<00:01:25.000> 80<00:01:25.119> or<00:01:25.299> 90

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
play a big factor and 75 or 80 or 90

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.690 
play a big factor and 75 or 80 or 90
nuts<00:01:25.930> like<00:01:26.140> me<00:01:26.380> should<00:01:26.830> all<00:01:26.920> fit<00:01:27.100> together<00:01:27.220> and

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
nuts like me should all fit together and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.399 
nuts like me should all fit together and
hopefully<00:01:28.420> complete<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.170> no<00:01:29.290> one

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
hopefully complete it with no one

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.880 
hopefully complete it with no one
getting<00:01:29.439> hurt<00:01:30.060> me<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> lot<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.299> fun<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.710> you're

looking at we think is a 13 or 14 flying

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.050 
looking at we think is a 13 or 14 flying
merkel<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:38.049> hard<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.770> decide<00:01:39.280> what<00:01:39.580> year<00:01:39.939> it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060
