you<00:01:09.479> guys<00:01:09.570> hear<00:01:09.810> anything<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:11.610> plays

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you guys hear anything but it plays

you guys hear anything but it plays
right<00:01:12.479> away<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.250> ahead<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
right away and then you can go ahead and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
right away and then you can go ahead and
just<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.240> immediate<00:01:15.780> controls<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
just use the immediate controls to go to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.880 
just use the immediate controls to go to
the<00:01:16.799> next<00:01:17.100> song<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.080> back<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.409> fine

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the next song and back just fine

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
the next song and back just fine
the<00:01:20.880> end<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> volume<00:01:21.570> gets<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.409> loud<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the end the volume gets really loud so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
the end the volume gets really loud so
the<00:01:23.280> volume<00:01:23.580> works<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.030> ways<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the volume works in two ways the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
the volume works in two ways the
headphones<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> volume<00:01:26.100> function

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
headphones have the volume function

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
headphones have the volume function
obviously<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> headphones<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
obviously so the headphones have like a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
obviously so the headphones have like a
volume<00:01:28.890> amplifier<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.970> down

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
volume amplifier so you go up and down

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
volume amplifier so you go up and down
as<00:01:30.329> well<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.650> increase<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> volume

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
as well as you can increase the volume

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.480 
as well as you can increase the volume
on<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.720> watch<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> leave<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
on the watch so for me I leave the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
on the watch so for me I leave the
volume<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> way<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.390> max<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
volume all the way at max and then I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.020 
volume all the way at max and then I
adjust<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> headphones<00:01:38.909> just

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
adjust it through the headphones just

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.539 
adjust it through the headphones just
peace<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.540> twofold<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.549> making

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
peace it's like twofold on this making

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.389 
peace it's like twofold on this making

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
the battery

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.150 
the battery
life<00:04:10.430> now<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.270> does<00:04:11.690> consume<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.860> battery

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
life now it does consume the battery

life now it does consume the battery
pretty<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:15.519> wouldn't<00:04:16.519> say<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.730> lot<00:04:17.030> but<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.299> would

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
pretty I wouldn't say a lot but I would

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.289 
pretty I wouldn't say a lot but I would
say<00:04:17.660> with<00:04:17.750> an<00:04:17.930> hour<00:04:18.139> I<00:04:18.290> lost<00:04:18.530> 10%<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:19.940> grand

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
say with an hour I lost 10% in the grand

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.970 
say with an hour I lost 10% in the grand
scheme<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.600> things<00:04:20.720> that's<00:04:21.169> not<00:04:21.410> too<00:04:21.650> much

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
scheme of things that's not too much

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.700 
scheme of things that's not too much
because<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.730> watch<00:04:22.910> will<00:04:23.120> still<00:04:23.330> last<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.960> good

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
because the watch will still last a good

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.520 
because the watch will still last a good
eight<00:04:24.980> to<00:04:25.130> ten<00:04:25.370> hours<00:04:25.790> but<00:04:26.090> what<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> did<00:04:27.050> was<00:04:27.200> I

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
working out or just you know you're

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.830

anyway listen to music we might do it I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.770 
anyway listen to music we might do it I
think<00:04:46.790> it's<00:04:46.880> perfect<00:04:47.360> for<00:04:47.390> that

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
think it's perfect for that

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.170 
think it's perfect for that
but<00:04:48.169> it's<00:04:48.290> not<00:04:48.410> perfect<00:04:48.650> for<00:04:49.160> using<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.060> for

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
but it's not perfect for using it for

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.490 
but it's not perfect for using it for
exercise<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.480> period<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.840> time<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.260> if<00:04:51.380> you're
