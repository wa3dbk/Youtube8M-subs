up<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> Zetas<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.930> had

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
up the Zetas was just because it had

such a good debut early on and it really

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
such a good debut early on and it really
comes<00:00:51.899> across<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.469> being<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:53.039> than<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> grunt

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

Gundam age and you get to see a shot of
it<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.280> fight

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
it and at fight

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.920 
it and at fight
one<00:02:12.010> normal<00:02:12.400> from<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> leonard<00:02:13.510> i'd<00:02:13.629> say<00:02:13.780> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
one normal from the leonard i'd say that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.449 
one normal from the leonard i'd say that
this<00:02:14.019> ms<00:02:14.379> is<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.590> little<00:02:14.920> bit<00:02:15.069> dull<00:02:15.430> but

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
this ms is a little bit dull but

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.190 
this ms is a little bit dull but
actually<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> plastic<00:02:16.629> having<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.989> white

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
actually the plastic having the white

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.809 
actually the plastic having the white
and<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> yellow<00:02:17.620> hand<00:02:17.980> stand<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:18.400> makes<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.760> a

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
and the yellow hand stand out makes it a

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.210 
and the yellow hand stand out makes it a
little<00:02:18.940> bit<00:02:19.120> more<00:02:19.360> lively<00:02:19.599> than<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:21.010> so

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
little bit more lively than this but so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.490 
little bit more lively than this but so
far<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.519> hasn't<00:02:21.700> really<00:02:22.120> impressed<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.200> much

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
far it hasn't really impressed that much

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.020 
far it hasn't really impressed that much
just<00:02:23.799> because<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.190> course<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.580> dark<00:02:24.760> suit

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
just because of course the dark suit

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.789 
just because of course the dark suit
fighting<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.450> space<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.379> haven't<00:02:26.650> seen<00:02:26.769> that

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
fighting in space you haven't seen that

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.500 
fighting in space you haven't seen that
much<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.159> it<00:02:27.250> but<00:02:27.370> there's<00:02:27.580> CG<00:02:28.030> as<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.329> faces

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
much of it but there's CG as it faces

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.180 
much of it but there's CG as it faces
off<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.110> Titus's<00:02:29.530> looking<00:02:29.860> good<00:02:29.980> and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
off with the Titus's looking good and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.460 
off with the Titus's looking good and
basically<00:02:31.120> yes<00:02:31.299> it's<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.629> step<00:02:31.840> up<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.140> speed

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
basically yes it's a step up in speed

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.979 
basically yes it's a step up in speed
and<00:02:32.620> power<00:02:32.799> from<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> gaff<00:02:33.489> ran<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.970> yes<00:02:34.299> they

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
and power from the gaff ran and yes they

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.600 
and power from the gaff ran and yes they
talked<00:02:35.200> about<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.620> compared<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.220> tightest

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610

to do multicolor plates which I'd

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.180 
to do multicolor plates which I'd
imagine<00:03:31.599> would<00:03:31.750> cost<00:03:31.900> some<00:03:32.079> more<00:03:32.260> money<00:03:32.440> down

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190

imagine would cost some more money down
here<00:03:33.400> for<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.669> beam<00:03:33.849> vulcans<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.870> hands

runner<00:04:17.050> you<00:04:17.680> can<00:04:17.710> sort<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.340> why<00:04:18.520> big<00:04:18.970> wings

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
runner you can sort of see why big wings

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.790 
runner you can sort of see why big wings
here<00:04:19.600> they<00:04:19.810> look<00:04:19.990> to<00:04:20.110> be<00:04:20.140> pretty<00:04:20.470> simple<00:04:20.710> to

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
here they look to be pretty simple to

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.650 
here they look to be pretty simple to
put<00:04:20.980> on<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.940> looks<00:04:22.240> like<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.480> do<00:04:22.630> have

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
put on and it looks like you do have

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.060 
put on and it looks like you do have
some<00:04:22.990> lining<00:04:23.320> although<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.650> will<00:04:23.740> mostly<00:04:23.980> be

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
some lining although it will mostly be

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.250 
some lining although it will mostly be
edging<00:04:24.520> down<00:04:24.550> there<00:04:24.910> on<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.630> legs

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
edging down there on the legs

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.110 
edging down there on the legs
a<00:04:26.290> small<00:04:26.830> deeply<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.370> wrap<00:04:27.520> things<00:04:27.700> up<00:04:27.910> which

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
a small deeply to wrap things up which

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.760 
a small deeply to wrap things up which
since<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.540> makes<00:04:28.720> up<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.230> looks<00:04:29.500> like<00:04:29.560> it's

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
since it makes up it looks like it's

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.320 
since it makes up it looks like it's
going<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:29.920> make<00:04:29.980> up<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.640> inner<00:04:30.790> frame<00:04:31.030> and

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
going to make up the inner frame and

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.940 
going to make up the inner frame and
most<00:04:31.480> of<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.690> joints<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.440> think<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.830> this

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
most of the joints you think that this

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.870 
most of the joints you think that this
could<00:04:33.070> have<00:04:33.190> been<00:04:33.280> done<00:04:33.490> in<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.670> different

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
could have been done in a different

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.300 
could have been done in a different
color<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.450> gray<00:04:34.660> but<00:04:35.290> anyway<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.100> what

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
color of gray but anyway this is what

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.050 
color of gray but anyway this is what
we've<00:04:36.490> got

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
we've got

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.550 
we've got
so<00:04:37.390> plus<00:04:37.600> here<00:04:37.780> with<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> stickers<00:04:38.410> though

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
so plus here with the stickers though

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.260 
so plus here with the stickers though
because<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:39.040> have<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.340> option<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.730> either<00:04:40.030> be

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
because you have the option to either be

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.850 
because you have the option to either be
lazy<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.810> just<00:04:40.990> put<00:04:41.140> on<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.320> stickers<00:04:41.650> two

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
lazy and just put on the stickers two

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.080 
lazy and just put on the stickers two
red<00:04:42.040> ones<00:04:42.190> on<00:04:42.400> either<00:04:42.460> side<00:04:42.790> of<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.940> cockpit

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
red ones on either side of the cockpit

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.330 
red ones on either side of the cockpit
or<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:44.320> can<00:04:44.470> put<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.740> green<00:04:45.010> one<00:04:45.160> down<00:04:45.280> on

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
or you can put this green one down on

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.400 
or you can put this green one down on
the<00:04:45.520> chest<00:04:45.760> or<00:04:45.940> use<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.360> clear<00:04:46.780> part<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
the chest or use that clear part to

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.500 
the chest or use that clear part to
paint<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.190> same<00:04:48.490> part<00:04:48.790> in<00:04:49.030> two<00:04:49.240> different

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
paint it the same part in two different

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.960 
paint it the same part in two different
clear<00:04:49.900> colors<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:51.130> cover<00:04:51.370> art<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.640> looking

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
clear colors the cover art is looking

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.880 
clear colors the cover art is looking
really<00:04:52.210> sharp<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.630> again<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.080> Susanoo<00:04:53.620> vibe

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
really sharp and again that Susanoo vibe

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710 
really sharp and again that Susanoo vibe
just<00:04:54.340> screams<00:04:54.760> through<00:04:55.060> with<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.360> except

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
just screams through with this except

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.690 
just screams through with this except
for<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.900> yellow<00:04:56.080> fingers<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.710> do<00:04:57.100> like<00:04:57.370> it's<00:04:57.610> a

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
for the yellow fingers I do like it's a

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.990 
for the yellow fingers I do like it's a
number<00:04:58.390> here<00:04:58.660> 10<00:04:58.960> 5<00:04:59.200> 5<00:04:59.440> 10<00:04:59.740> 100<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.490> that

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
number here 10 5 5 10 100 and that

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.310 
number here 10 5 5 10 100 and that
flight<00:05:01.270> mode<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.630> looking<00:05:01.930> more<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.230> more

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
flight mode is looking more and more

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.110 
flight mode is looking more and more
ridiculous<00:05:02.740> especially<00:05:03.670> when<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.880> look<00:05:04.000> at

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
ridiculous especially when you look at

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.820 
ridiculous especially when you look at
it<00:05:04.210> through<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.420> manual<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.410> do<00:05:05.530> get<00:05:05.680> some

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
it through the manual you do get some

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.440 
it through the manual you do get some
more<00:05:05.980> information<00:05:06.190> about<00:05:06.580> how<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.060> does<00:05:07.270> have

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
more information about how it does have

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.170 
more information about how it does have
the<00:05:07.630> large<00:05:07.900> Yui<00:05:08.230> ship<00:05:08.740> which<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.100> suppose<00:05:09.400> we

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
the large Yui ship which I suppose we

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.610 
the large Yui ship which I suppose we
are<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.630> see<00:05:10.750> in<00:05:10.870> future<00:05:11.170> episodes<00:05:11.260> that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
are going to see in future episodes that

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.660 
are going to see in future episodes that
when<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:11.800> get<00:05:11.920> inside<00:05:12.220> you're<00:05:12.370> going<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.520> see

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
when you get inside you're going to see

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.890 
when you get inside you're going to see
some<00:05:12.850> of<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:12.970> same<00:05:13.120> things<00:05:13.360> that<00:05:13.420> we've<00:05:13.630> seen

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
some of the same things that we've seen

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.840 
some of the same things that we've seen
from<00:05:14.140> around<00:05:14.440> they<00:05:15.100> talked<00:05:15.280> about<00:05:15.400> its<00:05:15.610> flight

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
from around they talked about its flight

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.460 
from around they talked about its flight
mode<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.330> they<00:05:16.600> can<00:05:16.630> see<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.050> tightest<00:05:17.350> and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
mode and they can see the tightest and

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.110 
mode and they can see the tightest and
how<00:05:17.620> it<00:05:17.800> has<00:05:17.950> evolved<00:05:18.430> into<00:05:18.490> something<00:05:18.640> newer

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
how it has evolved into something newer

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.810 
how it has evolved into something newer
and<00:05:19.360> stronger<00:05:19.780> as<00:05:19.930> needed<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:20.950> cool<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:21.730> they

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
and stronger as needed so cool that they

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.190 
and stronger as needed so cool that they
even<00:05:22.030> include<00:05:22.270> those<00:05:22.450> little<00:05:22.660> red<00:05:22.840> shoulder

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
even include those little red shoulder

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.720 
even include those little red shoulder
parts<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.590> are<00:05:23.800> actually<00:05:24.190> included<00:05:24.580> in<00:05:24.640> the

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
parts that are actually included in the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.030 
parts that are actually included in the
high-grade<00:05:25.090> model<00:05:25.510> when<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.410> transforms<00:05:26.920> into

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
high-grade model when it transforms into

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.680 
high-grade model when it transforms into
flight<00:05:27.310> mode<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.730> really<00:05:28.030> do<00:05:28.180> just<00:05:28.450> have<00:05:28.570> the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
flight mode you really do just have the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.720 
flight mode you really do just have the
legs<00:05:28.870> bent<00:05:29.140> back<00:05:29.440> but<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.130> hand<00:05:30.310> parts<00:05:30.580> the

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
legs bent back but the hand parts the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.910 
legs bent back but the hand parts the
fact<00:05:30.910> that<00:05:30.970> you<00:05:31.150> get<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.510> is<00:05:31.630> a<00:05:31.660> plus<00:05:31.960> there<00:05:32.770> it

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
fact that you get to is a plus there it

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.980 
fact that you get to is a plus there it
is<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.280> it<00:05:33.370> does<00:05:33.550> have<00:05:33.580> its<00:05:33.880> large<00:05:34.210> sword<00:05:34.630> and

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
is it it does have its large sword and

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.780 
is it it does have its large sword and
the<00:05:35.200> sensor<00:05:35.590> eyes<00:05:35.770> are<00:05:36.070> always<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.340> big<00:05:36.550> plus

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
the sensor eyes are always a big plus

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.760 
the sensor eyes are always a big plus
the<00:05:37.450> back<00:05:37.630> toe<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:37.840> wondered<00:05:38.200> how<00:05:38.350> this<00:05:38.560> would

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
the back toe I wondered how this would

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.350 
the back toe I wondered how this would
rank<00:05:39.070> compared<00:05:39.670> to<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:39.850> gaff<00:05:39.970> run<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.300> the

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
rank compared to the gaff run and the

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.210 
rank compared to the gaff run and the
Zetas<00:05:40.660> considering<00:05:41.530> that<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.740> Zetas<00:05:42.010> came

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
Zetas considering that the Zetas came

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.680 
Zetas considering that the Zetas came
out<00:05:42.340> earlier<00:05:42.640> but<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.910> back<00:05:43.060> toe<00:05:43.270> after

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
out earlier but the back toe after
