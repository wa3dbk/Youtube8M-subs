00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.610
 to find everything there, not on the street 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 maciel I came here today concluded that the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 title do not count five things that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 We have houses here in London. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 but of course these are things you do not have in your 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.539
 Brazil houses would otherwise have no meaning 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.760
 make a video saying that we have tv 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.810
 we have microwaves why not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.880
 showing river 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 are things that we only discover that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.970
 exists when we come here or 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.519
 when we see a video of you in the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.309
 youtube to help in this huh 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 so look at this list all five 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.730
 things that I will tell you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 I actually saw it on another's website. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.860
 blogger called love ghetto to have a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.480
 blog called basic needed it account 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.550
 Her life is very cool. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.379
 she also writes for the other site 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.670
 Much love of trips in Brazil that I 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.559
 I lost a traveler 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 besides all that she wrote 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.360
 recently a guide on london but 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.039
 not guide like any other guide is a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 guide to what she calls in the guide 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.329
 for beginners and beginners then this is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 It's very cool because it comes here for 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.400
 first time there's a lot of cool to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.590
 ti and also for the 2nd 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 Thank you, I hope you have lots of things. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.000
 Nice to find out she could 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.189
 Five things we have in London 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.640
 is in the houses here from london first 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.090
 of them are the heaters for our 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.030
 friends during all the winter months 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.159
 Neither natana on route 2 degrees negative here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 in the house is about 20 degrees or more 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.750
 least everyone gets short-sleeved 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.820
 home but only these great friends 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.100
 have seen our enemies when it comes to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.130
 because there we give ourselves 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 account that she is not fairy Godmother of the gas 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.670
 that warms our homes, but rather 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.700
 british gas 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.530
 and they do not charge cheap so on 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.190
 size in the summer but how to find the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.230
 option can not be taken out and put when 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.670
 start again but you can use 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.960
 do other things to extend the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.850
 clothing for example even no longer gives 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.680
 to put the clothes on the street 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.160
 however you can simply decorate 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.390
 You can draw me, can I? 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.640
 have fun in peace 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.160
 but of course it is also the houses have ears 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.840
 but only that some of them as the case 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.970
 here at home and also runs on gas 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.830
 then guess who supplies the gas 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.490
 new nothing cheap in the data of 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.470
 researches 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.800
 The second thing that has to touch 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.720
 London is fire alarm and that is 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.460
 mandatory in all homes in the city 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.490
 already suffered a lot with the fire then 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.290
 all houses must have the alarm and the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.630
 declared it along this line that she 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.460
 did that sometimes says there to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.920
 simply with the smoke of a steak 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.020
 is missing that nice thing but 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.150
 I take carasso in the beginning but after 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.760
 get used to and then begins to hear 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.230
 the neighbors' word and everything knows that the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.990
 alarm he's getting bug 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.430
 it's just the same as lakes 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.560
 that we have in Brazil the name of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.480
 safety rings the alarm of a house 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.130
 No one goes there and when they do not know 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.160
 played by a girl passed the front 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.440
 Because the cat woke up at last. 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.100
 but why is not it a crook to go home? 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.780
 When there is no one, go and see 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.330
 happens happens that's something that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.360
 have in your london home is carpeting 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.400
 that all the houses also have here in the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.380
 My house we just have not got in 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.420
 It's true in the kitchen and in 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.630
 bathroom but the whole house has to 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.600
 apparent fourth item is very luxurious that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.540
 is a bathtub all the houses of london 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.910
 has a bath and is rather a lot of people me 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.400
 question and then what is the current one? 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.690
 bathtub as is a bath tub 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.950
 and my answer is always the same as me 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.090
 I have no idea 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.230
 In this year and a half I live in London. 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.390
 I never 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.580
 A bathtub has no plans for 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.370
 take because you do not have the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.080
 stay waiting the bathtub fills with water 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 something else is not very cool either 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.280
 bathtub is clean she is because she is a baita 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.409
 of a business is on the ground that has to 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.360
 to get into it because it is not 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.569
 very nice also to clean and this 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.640
 also not counting the curtain it 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.299
 Kitchen to that of the plastic 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.700
 around 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.329
 and it is during the winter to tan it solves 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.200
 sure, give a hug and you do it 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.959
 here o 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.290
 understood that curtin could only be avoided 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.560
 that last item no less 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.229
 important is the outlet switch 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.209
 this is an invention that I agree with 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.370
 with her on her list should be 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.430
 separated to the whole world because it is 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.199
 very smart so study has already left 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.930
 from home and stay a week off anyway 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.300
 will simply there and gives a click 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.770
 plug and the power is off. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.050
 more electric current passing there 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.080
 understood not going to test neighborhood is going 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.760
 spend much better energy and moreover 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.789
 You do not have to be afraid to get a shock. 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.130
 electric only sometimes what I do 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.099
 and I forgot to 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.260
 call all the time and here it happens clear 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.760
 career accountant then arrives at 10 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.919
 percent more or less the battery and 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.410
 flashes neon to end the battery 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:02.090
 who forgot to do something and still 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.979
 that it is really the sixth item that 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.650

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.270
 There's a lot of cold weather here in this country. 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.950
 however end up having to leave their 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.930
 clothes drying in the house 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.780
 I do not want to not have to decorate your 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.000
 room with that beautiful piece that is a 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.400
 clothes dryer and unprecedented cup 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.770

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.129

 who's going to have your house in london is 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.879
 When I had to change here, you let me. 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.949
 saying in the comments to another 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.830
 item you have in your home in london that 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.080
 There was no house in Brazil, and of course you forget.

 to enjoy videos like to share it 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.400
