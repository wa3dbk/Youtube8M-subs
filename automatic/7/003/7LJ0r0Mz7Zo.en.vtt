a little bit later in this demo here's a
clean<00:03:15.370> tone

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.480 

and<00:03:19.490> channel<00:03:20.000> 2<00:03:20.210> with<00:03:20.600> more<00:03:21.100> saturated<00:03:22.100> Dean

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
and channel 2 with more saturated Dean

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:52.490 
and channel 2 with more saturated Dean
Sam<00:03:22.850> dialed<00:03:23.450> in

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.309 

now<00:03:53.500> let's<00:03:53.980> dial<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.700> little<00:03:55.120> bit<00:03:55.239> more<00:03:57.120> and

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
now let's dial in a little bit more and

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.929 
now let's dial in a little bit more and
I'll<00:03:59.319> just<00:03:59.560> let<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.769> listen<00:04:00.189> here's<00:04:00.700> clean

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
I'll just let you listen here's clean

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:15.430 
I'll just let you listen here's clean
tone<00:04:01.120> again

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:29.890 

you

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.170 

you

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:47.100 

you

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.080 

so<00:04:48.110> as<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:48.830> hear<00:04:48.890> there<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.610> lot<00:04:50.060> of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
so as you can hear there is a lot of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.170 
so as you can hear there is a lot of
saturation<00:04:51.050> gain<00:04:51.830> overdrive<00:04:52.520> available<00:04:53.000> on

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
saturation gain overdrive available on

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
saturation gain overdrive available on
on<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.800> controls<00:04:55.160> in<00:04:55.310> this<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:56.330> really

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
on in the controls in this and really

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.020 
on in the controls in this and really
obviously<00:04:57.680> it's<00:04:57.950> very<00:04:58.040> amp<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.610> it's<00:04:58.880> a

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
obviously it's very amp like it's a

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.060 
obviously it's very amp like it's a
preamp<00:04:59.450> made<00:04:59.840> by<00:05:00.020> an<00:05:00.140> amplifier<00:05:00.260> company<00:05:00.860> and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
preamp made by an amplifier company and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.210 
preamp made by an amplifier company and
so<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.820> sounds<00:05:02.300> really<00:05:02.570> natural<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.500> we're

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
so it sounds really natural and we're

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.350 
so it sounds really natural and we're
just<00:05:04.310> going<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.520> back<00:05:04.670> up<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:05.000> controls<00:05:05.330> a

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
just going to back up the controls a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.460 
just going to back up the controls a
little<00:05:05.510> bit<00:05:05.600> now<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.750> want<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.080> focus<00:05:06.170> a<00:05:06.380> little

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
little bit now I want to focus a little

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.790 
little bit now I want to focus a little
bit<00:05:06.650> on<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.070> interactive<00:05:08.530> tonal<00:05:09.530> controls

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
bit on the interactive tonal controls

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.130 
bit on the interactive tonal controls
the<00:05:09.980> bass<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.460> treble<00:05:10.490> over<00:05:10.880> here<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.240> so

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
the bass and the treble over here and so

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.270 
the bass and the treble over here and so
I'll<00:05:12.290> just<00:05:12.440> let<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.590> listen<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:13.010> clean<00:05:13.220> again

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.330 

but<00:05:19.210> both<00:05:19.480> of<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.050> tonal<00:05:20.500> controls<00:05:20.889> at<00:05:21.130> about

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
but both of the tonal controls at about

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.770 
but both of the tonal controls at about
12<00:05:21.550> noon<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:21.910> then<00:05:22.300> I'll<00:05:22.389> show<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.660> some

12 noon and then I'll show you some
different<00:05:23.170> options<00:05:23.230> just<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.220> can<00:05:24.370> hear

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
different options just so you can hear

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.970 
different options just so you can hear
how<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:25.330> little<00:05:25.510> bit<00:05:25.690> how<00:05:25.810> at<00:05:26.110> least<00:05:26.170> it<00:05:26.650> shapes

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
how a little bit how at least it shapes

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:50.740 
how a little bit how at least it shapes
the<00:05:27.100> sound

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:09.380 

well<00:05:51.590> back<00:05:51.800> off<00:05:52.040> on<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.370> low-end

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
so what we have here from matchless in

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.970 
so what we have here from matchless in
the<00:07:11.620> hot<00:07:11.830> box<00:07:11.860> 3<00:07:12.340> is<00:07:12.520> a<00:07:12.990> fantastic<00:07:13.990> 2<00:07:14.170> channel<00:07:14.530> 2

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
the hot box 3 is a fantastic 2 channel 2

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.100 
the hot box 3 is a fantastic 2 channel 2
preamp<00:07:15.370> pedal<00:07:15.670> really<00:07:16.360> you<00:07:16.660> can<00:07:16.810> have<00:07:16.840> your

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
preamp pedal really you can have your

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.810 
preamp pedal really you can have your
clean<00:07:17.380> tone<00:07:17.620> from<00:07:17.980> your<00:07:18.130> amp<00:07:18.250> that<00:07:18.580> can<00:07:18.730> be

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
clean tone from your amp that can be

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.020 
clean tone from your amp that can be
considered<00:07:19.060> a<00:07:19.330> channel<00:07:20.230> 0<00:07:20.590> or<00:07:20.830> channel<00:07:21.130> 1<00:07:21.250> and

then you have the green option which is
a<00:07:23.920> clean<00:07:24.280> channel<00:07:24.490> through<00:07:25.030> the<00:07:25.600> hot<00:07:25.810> box<00:07:26.020> 3

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
a clean channel through the hot box 3

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.010 
a clean channel through the hot box 3
and<00:07:26.470> then<00:07:27.040> you<00:07:27.220> have<00:07:27.580> the<00:07:27.820> channel<00:07:28.480> 2<00:07:28.660> which<00:07:28.870> is

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
and then you have the channel 2 which is

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.950 
and then you have the channel 2 which is
a<00:07:29.050> gain<00:07:29.830> or<00:07:30.100> overdrive<00:07:30.640> channel<00:07:31.060> through<00:07:31.930> the

a gain or overdrive channel through the

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.660 
a gain or overdrive channel through the
hot<00:07:32.140> box<00:07:32.350> 3<00:07:32.530> so<00:07:32.680> you<00:07:32.770> can<00:07:32.890> take<00:07:33.010> any<00:07:33.190> single

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
hot box 3 so you can take any single

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.950 
hot box 3 so you can take any single
channel<00:07:33.970> lamp<00:07:34.120> and<00:07:34.300> turn<00:07:34.510> it<00:07:34.600> into<00:07:34.720> basically

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
channel lamp and turn it into basically

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.860 
channel lamp and turn it into basically
a<00:07:35.260> 3<00:07:35.650> channel<00:07:35.920> amplifier<00:07:36.310> very<00:07:37.060> very<00:07:37.300> cool<00:07:37.540> and

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
a 3 channel amplifier very very cool and

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.750 
a 3 channel amplifier very very cool and
it<00:07:38.110> it<00:07:38.320> really<00:07:38.710> has<00:07:39.040> beautiful<00:07:39.700> tube<00:07:40.690> tone<00:07:40.990> and
