these<00:00:34.250> past<00:00:34.520> years<00:00:34.700> now<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.630> have<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.930> chance<00:00:35.960> to

these past years now I have a chance to

wildest<00:00:38.690> dream<00:00:40.930> well<00:00:41.930> I<00:00:41.989> basically<00:00:42.260> only<00:00:43.040> did

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
wildest dream well I basically only did

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.460 
wildest dream well I basically only did
three<00:00:44.059> things<00:00:44.090> growing<00:00:44.630> up<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.140> played

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
three things growing up I played

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.650 
three things growing up I played
basketball<00:00:45.739> I<00:00:46.160> played<00:00:46.489> football<00:00:46.790> and<00:00:47.239> I

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
basketball I played football and I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.080 
basketball I played football and I
played<00:00:47.930> video<00:00:48.110> games<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.580> think<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
played video games and I think the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.240 
played video games and I think the
beginnings<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.900> idea<00:00:51.290> for<00:00:51.530> slamball<00:00:51.980> was

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
beginnings of the idea for slamball was

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.490 
beginnings of the idea for slamball was
to<00:00:52.430> combine<00:00:52.670> those<00:00:53.150> three<00:00:53.510> things<00:00:53.750> kind<00:00:54.470> of

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
to combine those three things kind of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.470 
to combine those three things kind of
the<00:00:54.620> porosity<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.309> football<00:00:55.879> with<00:00:56.449> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
the porosity of football with the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.170 
the porosity of football with the
athleticism<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:57.980> grace<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.280> basketball

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
athleticism and the grace of basketball

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.299 
athleticism and the grace of basketball
but<00:00:59.600> then<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.930> mix<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.650> little<00:01:00.680> bit<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.190> a

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
but then to mix in a little bit of a

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.000 
but then to mix in a little bit of a
videogame<00:01:01.850> mentality<00:01:02.449> in<00:01:02.660> there<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.830> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
videogame mentality in there and the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.280 
videogame mentality in there and the
idea<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.460> guys<00:01:04.699> jumping<00:01:05.390> higher<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:06.020> hitting

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
idea of guys jumping higher and hitting

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.430 
idea of guys jumping higher and hitting
harder<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.640> combination<00:01:08.150> just<00:01:09.140> kind<00:01:09.380> of

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
harder and that combination just kind of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.750 
harder and that combination just kind of
got<00:01:09.560> thrown<00:01:09.800> into<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.250> blender<00:01:12.640> well<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.730> first

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
got thrown into a blender well the first

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.350 
got thrown into a blender well the first
court<00:01:14.300> was<00:01:15.130> wasn't<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.190> pretty<00:01:16.400> sight<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:17.060> mean

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
court was wasn't a pretty sight I mean

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.720 
court was wasn't a pretty sight I mean
at<00:01:17.930> one<00:01:18.140> point<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.650> think<00:01:18.710> one<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.520> players

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
at one point I think one of the players

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.000 
at one point I think one of the players
actually<00:01:19.970> fell<00:01:20.360> through<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.750> floor<00:01:21.010> first

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
actually fell through the floor first

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.430 
actually fell through the floor first
court<00:01:22.340> really<00:01:22.700> only<00:01:22.850> had<00:01:23.560> one<00:01:24.670> spring<00:01:25.670> bed<00:01:25.880> and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
court really only had one spring bed and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.680 
court really only had one spring bed and
guys<00:01:27.440> would<00:01:27.740> run<00:01:28.190> at<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.060> then<00:01:29.210> take<00:01:29.450> off

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
guys would run at it and then take off

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.870 
guys would run at it and then take off
and<00:01:30.050> from<00:01:30.260> there<00:01:30.530> we<00:01:31.130> learned<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.550> you

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and from there we learned that you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.910 
and from there we learned that you
really<00:01:32.150> need<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.360> spring<00:01:32.990> beds<00:01:33.230> one<00:01:33.590> for<00:01:33.830> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
really need to spring beds one for the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.190 
really need to spring beds one for the
offense<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:34.520> one<00:01:34.700> for<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.030> defense<00:01:35.480> so<00:01:36.110> we

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
offense and one for the defense so we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.200 
offense and one for the defense so we
have<00:01:36.320> these<00:01:36.440> little<00:01:36.620> crappy<00:01:37.250> mini<00:01:37.670> tramps

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
have these little crappy mini tramps

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.240 
have these little crappy mini tramps
that<00:01:38.390> were<00:01:38.510> about<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:39.020> big<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.560> they<00:01:40.190> were

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
that were about this big and they were

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.160 
that were about this big and they were
pretty<00:01:40.340> much<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.820> death<00:01:41.210> trap<00:01:41.450> because<00:01:41.870> you'd

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
pretty much a death trap because you'd

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.530 
pretty much a death trap because you'd
be<00:01:42.320> running<00:01:42.530> Adam<00:01:42.950> full<00:01:43.190> speed<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.850> then<00:01:44.360> you

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
be running Adam full speed and then you

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.750 
be running Adam full speed and then you
try<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.870> hit<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.350> little<00:01:45.680> tiny<00:01:46.040> circle<00:01:46.610> with

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
try to hit this little tiny circle with

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.670 
try to hit this little tiny circle with
both<00:01:46.970> feet<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.660> that<00:01:48.110> proved<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.530> be<00:01:48.650> very

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
both feet and that proved to be very

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.800 
both feet and that proved to be very
very<00:01:48.980> difficult<00:01:49.340> from<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.360> court<00:01:50.660> we

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
very difficult from that court we

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.480 
very difficult from that court we
finally<00:01:51.230> settled<00:01:51.440> into<00:01:51.740> our<00:01:51.950> final

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
finally settled into our final

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.020 
finally settled into our final
configuration<00:01:52.790> which<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:55.030> defensive

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
configuration which is a defensive

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.600 
configuration which is a defensive
trampoline<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.870> three<00:01:57.200> perimeter<00:01:57.610> offensive

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
trampoline and three perimeter offensive

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.580 
trampoline and three perimeter offensive
trampolines<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.450> a<00:02:00.170> lot<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.560> different

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
trampolines and a lot of different

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.520 
trampolines and a lot of different
players<00:02:01.420> found<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:02.690> these<00:02:02.960> different<00:02:03.230> ways

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
players found all these different ways

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.920 
players found all these different ways
to<00:02:03.860> link<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.430> combine<00:02:04.820> those<00:02:05.180> opportunities

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
to link and combine those opportunities

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.259 
to link and combine those opportunities
on<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.410> court<00:02:06.710> into<00:02:07.370> more<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.760> more<00:02:07.970> complex

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
on the court into more and more complex

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.010 
on the court into more and more complex
strategies

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.440 

the<00:02:13.020> ice<00:02:13.230> hockey<00:02:13.500> walls<00:02:13.950> are<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:15.090> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
the ice hockey walls are actually a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.710 
the ice hockey walls are actually a
lucky<00:02:16.320> accident<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.210> first<00:02:18.540> started

or<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> loose<00:02:31.050> ball<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.100> go<00:02:32.220> right

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

off<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.060> decks<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.320> threw<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.710> wall<00:02:35.040> up

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
off the decks so we threw this wall up

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.940 
off the decks so we threw this wall up
around<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> perimeter<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.350> whole<00:02:37.590> idea

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
around the perimeter and the whole idea

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.730 
around the perimeter and the whole idea
was<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> keep<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.700> ball<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:38.940> play<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.990> now<00:02:40.260> all

was to keep the ball in play so now all
