00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.709 
univision pussies in the raging water
and<00:01:00.530> save<00:01:00.709> somebody<00:01:01.129> you<00:01:01.519> really<00:01:02.149> can't<00:01:02.359> train

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
for that so we get them put a lot of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.370 
for that so we get them put a lot of
stress<00:01:04.879> on<00:01:05.000> them<00:01:05.119> in<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.299> pool<00:01:05.479> let<00:01:06.170> them<00:01:06.259> know

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
stress on them in the pool let them know

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.420 
stress on them in the pool let them know
the<00:01:06.500> limits<00:01:06.829> and<00:01:06.979> let<00:01:07.070> them<00:01:07.159> know<00:01:07.280> their

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
the limits and let them know their

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.100 
the limits and let them know their
boundaries<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:08.030> after<00:01:08.869> they<00:01:08.930> leave<00:01:09.049> here

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
boundaries and after they leave here

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.830 
boundaries and after they leave here
they<00:01:09.950> have<00:01:10.130> somewhat<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.820> an<00:01:11.030> idea<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.390> how<00:01:11.630> far

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
they have somewhat of an idea of how far

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.520

they<00:01:12.020> can<00:01:12.079> go

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
they can go

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.029 
they can go
so<00:01:13.430> some<00:01:13.850> from<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.270> very<00:01:14.509> first<00:01:14.780> day<00:01:15.140> it's<00:01:15.799> my

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
so some from the very first day it's my

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.090 
so some from the very first day it's my
goal<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.340> always<00:01:17.109> make<00:01:18.109> them<00:01:18.439> get<00:01:18.859> to<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100

point during the day where they're

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.570 
point during the day where they're
thinking<00:01:21.439> this<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:22.430> not<00:01:22.579> my<00:01:22.700> comfort<00:01:22.880> zone

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580
