00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
or to replace the existing memory this

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.030 
or to replace the existing memory this
particular<00:00:15.940> laptop<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.600> is<00:00:16.690> the<00:00:16.870> i3<00:00:17.590> version

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
particular laptop and is the i3 version

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.720 
particular laptop and is the i3 version
it<00:00:19.000> can<00:00:19.270> install<00:00:19.660> with<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:22.300> sim<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:24.340> give

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
it can install with one sim to give

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.250 
it can install with one sim to give
gigabit<00:00:25.390> memory

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
gigabit memory

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.360 
gigabit memory
so<00:00:26.730> first<00:00:27.730> up<00:00:27.940> first<00:00:28.240> I<00:00:28.710> recommend<00:00:29.710> every<00:00:30.190> time

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.370 
so first up first I recommend every time

drive cage and on top you have the one

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.969 
drive cage and on top you have the one
bank<00:01:18.249> memory<00:01:18.759> that's<00:01:18.999> installed<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:20.530> what<00:01:20.950> I

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
bank memory that's installed from what I

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.889 
bank memory that's installed from what I
understand<00:01:21.549> most<00:01:21.969> of<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.240> configurations

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
understand most of the configurations

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.620 
understand most of the configurations
for<00:01:23.259> this<00:01:23.469> laptop<00:01:23.889> anyway<00:01:24.490> just<00:01:25.329> come<00:01:25.539> with

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
for this laptop anyway just come with

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.050 
for this laptop anyway just come with
one<00:01:25.990> dim<00:01:26.350> either<00:01:26.889> two<00:01:27.280> or<00:01:27.549> four

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
one dim either two or four

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.370 
one dim either two or four
you<00:01:28.600> can<00:01:28.810> installed<00:01:29.229> two<00:01:29.619> for<00:01:30.159> gigabit<00:01:31.380> dims

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
you can installed two for gigabit dims

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.889 
you can installed two for gigabit dims
and<00:01:32.799> that<00:01:32.979> would<00:01:33.100> make<00:01:33.219> it<00:01:33.369> eight<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:33.999> in<00:01:34.779> order

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
and that would make it eight so in order

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.510 
and that would make it eight so in order
to<00:01:35.020> install<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.560> second<00:01:35.920> one<00:01:36.069> because<00:01:36.279> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
to install the second one because the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.699 
to install the second one because the
first<00:01:36.700> one<00:01:36.939> is<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.209> installed<00:01:37.689> up<00:01:37.810> top<00:01:38.049> what

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
first one is it installed up top what

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.069 
first one is it installed up top what
you're<00:01:38.799> gonna<00:01:38.889> have<00:01:39.069> to<00:01:39.189> do<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.549> use<00:01:40.389> the<00:01:40.719> two

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
you're gonna have to do is use the two

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.309 
you're gonna have to do is use the two
notches<00:01:41.319> on<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.709> side<00:01:42.990> release<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:46.090> dim<00:01:46.329> and

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
notches on the side release the dim and

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.050 
notches on the side release the dim and
just<00:01:48.009> pulling<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.490> slightly<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:51.759> can

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
just pulling it slightly and now I can

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.199 
just pulling it slightly and now I can
install<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:53.170> second<00:01:53.590> one<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.090> don't<00:01:55.090> know<00:01:55.149> if

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
to install this as a second one so put

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.410 
to install this as a second one so put
it<00:02:07.899> in<00:02:07.929> place<00:02:08.200> on<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> lower<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:10.330> then

both sides that's the first one second

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.690 
both sides that's the first one second
one<00:02:22.000> same<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:23.320> make<00:02:23.440> sure<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.830> line<00:02:24.010> hit<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
one same just make sure the line hit the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.230 
one same just make sure the line hit the
notch<00:02:24.880> here<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.510> put<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.890> any<00:02:26.890> other<00:02:26.980> way

push it in until it's fully inserted and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.020 
push it in until it's fully inserted and
then<00:02:32.170> push<00:02:32.530> down<00:02:32.560> make<00:02:33.160> sure<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> two

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
then push down make sure that the two

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.470 
then push down make sure that the two
notches<00:02:34.210> here<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.660> engaged<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:36.210> that's<00:02:37.210> pretty
