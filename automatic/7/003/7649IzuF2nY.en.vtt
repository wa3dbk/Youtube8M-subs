00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.899
 heavily armed units at 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.030
 main airport of the Crimea the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.280
 Troops have cordoned off the terrain 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 decide who is allowed in and who is not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
 the soldiers do not say that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 command but they act the Ukrainian 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 The government is sure Russia has it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.590
 Thousands of soldiers are sent to Moscow 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.810
 in the past few days 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.740
 from an invasion speak the new 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.740
 Government in Kiel 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.960
 this inappropriate presence of russian 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.620
 soldiers in the Crimea is nothing else 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.239
 as a provocation but moscow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.790
 try us in a military 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.790
 Conflict has failed 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 for the Cabinet in Kiev is not 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.980
 just a power struggle with moscow also 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 politically responsible in the Crimea 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.960
 themselves are posing offensively 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.760
 to the side of russia the head of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.739
 autonomy government has the command authority 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.110
 taken over by the security authorities 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.630
 a referendum on the future of the Crimea 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.799
 He preferred him at the end of the month and he 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.420
 Russia is officially looking for assistance 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.560
 I am responsible for life and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.909
 the security of the citizens 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.159
 Therefore, offer the Russian 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.470
 President Putin asks for help with the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 Peacekeeping in the Crimea 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.280
 sounds like an invitation to the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 Russian troops and is probably like that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.829
 meant 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 europeans and americans are worried 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.009
 about this development 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.030
 us president obama sends one 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.829
 clear warning in the direction of moscow 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.140
 an injury of the sovereignty and the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 borders of ukraine would be profoundly the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.850
 stabilize and become the usa 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.049
 make sure each one 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 military intervention in ukraine their 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.040
 Obama obviously considers the price 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.350
 the g8 summit planned for june in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 to let Russia burst for the Kremlin 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340
 that would be a huge diplomatic 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.619
 slight 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.780
 but if he wants the Russian government from 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.799
 to bring her course in the Crimea crisis 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
 would be questionable 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.429
 At the moment, the signs are in any case 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.649
 on confrontation 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.910
 ukrainian government now has its 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.860
 Troops in the Crimea 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.739
 alertness and emphasized 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.180
 she'll turn out to the provocations 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.180
 do not bend Russia
