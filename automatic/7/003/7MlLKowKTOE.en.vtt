00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hi in this video do you show 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.130
 that you will be able to find 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.109
 easily the rhythm and songs 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.230
 that you want to play you must know 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 first of all it's that you have to master 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.160
 so perfectly and rhythmic by hand 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.870
 right that it has to be integrated that is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 no problem with that you already have 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.680
 actually not playing rhythm 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 it necessarily corresponds to your songs 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.519
 since the goal will be to find them 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.750
 but that there is no problem with the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 movement that you master well of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 the round trip in different flows and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.109
 be it clear with that because if 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.610
 you not yet mastered it to us 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.380
 was not going to know time starts with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 mick when does it end when 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 are we going to have to apply these 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.660
 chords is what we will have to find 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.829
 movements play and not played and the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.899
 blow it's going to be a lot harder for 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.250
 you even if I will detail everything 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 step by step when I created a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
 kind of procedure if we want to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.730
 successfully recover very easily 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 rhythmic just has to follow the steps 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 and in the end you have your rhythm and if 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 you are not comfortable with eric smic 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.050
 it's going to be a lot more complicated so 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.579
 if it's not integrated yet I 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.320
 advise to go to see my program 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.969
 improved and richard or ethnic 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 you will understand everything and after this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.790
 will be much easier to find 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.830
 your replicas 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 you can have two methods that I 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 will explain to you a first one more 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 use their help or make use of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 listening to succeed so has found the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.869
 technical 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 a second wheel from directly 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.630
 of the game to succeed in doing that I you 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.939
 then propose exercises of these 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 exercises it's going to be very simple I 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.360
 played rhythmic loops so this 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.250
 will be in the attached files and so 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.270
 it will be to you to find these the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.070
 clinics and so I'm counting on you 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.750
 to not cheat for not going to see the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.460
 day correction is written in austria 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 after to put this into practice I'll 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 really advises started on 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 very simple pieces where the agreement 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.060
 strongly rhythmic and on 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.659
 pieces that you usually 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.329
 to hear 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.340
 because it will be that the issue is 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
 when more one actually makes it more 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 will have listened to more things it will be 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.880
 accustomed to finding rhythmic goes 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.829
 afterwards it's simple 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.390
 to be able to play them quickly without 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.280
 have to resume the whole procedure 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.659
 at the beginning so I detail all that and the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.509
 goal is that it becomes an automatism 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.950
 and you no longer need to do all 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.329
 the steps I showed you at the beginning 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 to remove the first step then the 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.050
 second et cetera and so on sweet 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.120
 the more you go for rhythmic 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.410
 the more you will do that more after this 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.660
 will be easy for you to find them 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.840
 after you can even just listen to the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.819
 piece a few seconds right next to the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.340
 rhythmic sometimes and power after 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.239
 recreate directly but true 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.560
 that begins it is not necessarily 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.650
 obvious to do that and so you have to 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.849
 practice this especially exercised the ear 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.049
 found his rhythmic 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.700
 so I explain to you the first 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.290
 method what we will do is we go 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.360
 take a sheet of paper and so 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.319
 you will write the arrows so the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.400
 leaves but that's what I explain 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.849
 to do with him we want to use 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.819
 8 or 16 arrow depending on the speed of the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.440
 piece so if it's a rap song a 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.540
 fast rhythmic you will use 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.880
 this arrow to 6 and a language of 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.130
 use it 8 arrow so you write 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.420
 your eight new 16 arrow on a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.209
 sheet of paper so never the same 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.900
 meaning one it's not hoba hoba hoba or on 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.870
 nights these doubles and we will identify 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.489
 so that's why we're going to take a 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.019
 software for example where we already know 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.340
 the end of this excerpt from the group shot 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.780
 private you can find 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.090
 the entire video 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.049
 plus partitions and 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.160
 game cards for work 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.200
 correctly all that is great 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.790
 progress by clicking on the button 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.069
 below registering with the private group 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.200
 so you also have access to everything 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.750
 the content so that will say of course 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.220
 the last courses posted but also the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.569
 master classes in which she 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.250
 answer your questions and I therefore full 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.510
 of things on the guitar and all 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.549
 training for work points 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.130
 accurate improve yourself here you can 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.630
 really to take 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.640
 discovering guitars full of tricks 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.140
 and stay motivated because you're going 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.880
 learn a lot of things and I had 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.110
 turned round to the guitar so here is 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.550
 I find myself on the other side because 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.380
 that click on the button just in 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.380
 underneath and we find ourselves right away
