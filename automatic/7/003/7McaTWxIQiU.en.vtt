00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

I'm<00:00:00.179> talking<00:00:00.420> about<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.719> pants<00:00:00.989> flat<00:00:01.380> bottom

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I'm talking about the pants flat bottom

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.249 
I'm talking about the pants flat bottom
can<00:00:02.159> that's<00:00:02.399> that's<00:00:02.850> got<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> solid<00:00:03.540> base<00:00:03.570> on<00:00:04.049> it

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
can that's that's got a solid base on it

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.670 
can that's that's got a solid base on it
that<00:00:04.859> will<00:00:05.220> distribute<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.029> heat<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.109> going

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
that will distribute the heat is going

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.150 
that will distribute the heat is going
to<00:00:07.770> be<00:00:07.890> better<00:00:08.130> than<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:08.610> that's<00:00:08.820> hollow<00:00:10.160> some

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
to be better than one that's hollow some

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.709 
to be better than one that's hollow some
of<00:00:11.280> them<00:00:11.370> are<00:00:11.519> solid<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> bottom<00:00:12.360> like

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
of them are solid on the bottom like

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.160 
of them are solid on the bottom like
this<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> pans<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.880> hot<00:00:15.030> enough<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this so now the pans are hot enough and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.830 
this so now the pans are hot enough and
we<00:00:16.289> want<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.560> fill<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> wells<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:18.660> don't

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
we want to fill up the wells you don't

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.120 
we want to fill up the wells you don't
fill<00:00:19.050> them<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> way<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> top<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
fill them all the way to the top you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.769 
fill them all the way to the top you
want<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> fill<00:00:20.490> them<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:21.090> actually<00:00:21.300> it's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
want to fill them out actually it's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.349 
want to fill them out actually it's
maybe<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> little<00:00:22.320> bit<00:00:22.560> over<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
maybe a little bit over so you want to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
maybe a little bit over so you want to
fill<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.630> up<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.109> short<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> top

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
fill it up so it's just short of the top

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.170 
fill it up so it's just short of the top
so<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.920> as<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.640> batter<00:00:31.850> expands<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.030> it's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so that as the batter expands when it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.490 
so that as the batter expands when it's
cooked<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.719> doesn't<00:00:34.050> overflow<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:37.350> just

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
cooked it doesn't overflow so I'm just

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.549 
cooked it doesn't overflow so I'm just
going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> pour<00:00:37.950> these<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:40.020> we're

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
going to pour these in here and we're

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.930 
going to pour these in here and we're
gonna<00:00:40.649> wait<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.399> until<00:00:43.940> hopefully

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
gonna wait a little bit until hopefully

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.100 
gonna wait a little bit until hopefully
these<00:00:45.329> pans<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.780> hot<00:00:45.960> enough<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:48.989> want

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
these pans are hot enough you don't want

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
these pans are hot enough you don't want
too<00:00:49.320> hot<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.070> outside<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.969> burned

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
too hot or the outside will get burned

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.920 
too hot or the outside will get burned
before<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> middle<00:00:52.860> part<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.370> liquid

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
before the middle part that's liquid

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.189 
before the middle part that's liquid
have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> chance<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.680> cooked<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.550> way

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
have a chance to get cooked all the way

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.740 
have a chance to get cooked all the way
so<00:01:01.789> we'll<00:01:03.260> come<00:01:04.260> back<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.949> later

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
so we'll come back a little bit later

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.490 
so we'll come back a little bit later
when<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:08.720> deliver<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> middle

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
when we deliver you can see that middle

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
when we deliver you can see that middle
one<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> already<00:01:11.040> overflowing<00:01:11.670> starting<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
one is already overflowing starting to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.350 
one is already overflowing starting to
get<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.840> too<00:01:13.170> full<00:01:16.850> back<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
get a little too full back in just a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.410 
get a little too full back in just a
minute<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:21.560> make<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> first<00:01:22.920> turn<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.189> this

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.390 

so<00:01:27.690> as<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.500> see<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.800> middle<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so as you can see that middle one is a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
so as you can see that middle one is a
little<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:29.970> full<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.690> as<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> put<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
little bit over full but as you put the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
little bit over full but as you put the
fork<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.340> twist<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
fork in and then you twist it like this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
fork in and then you twist it like this
and<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> reason<00:01:34.050> you<00:01:34.170> twist<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and the reason you twist it like this is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
and the reason you twist it like this is
so<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.520> liquid<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.690> batter<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.170> flow

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so that the liquid the batter can flow

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.440 
so that the liquid the batter can flow
across<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> turn<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
across it when it when you turn it so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
across it when it when you turn it so
you<00:01:39.540> put<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> twist<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.850> like

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
you put it in and then you twist it like

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.260 
you put it in and then you twist it like
that<00:01:42.270> okay<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.800> halfway<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:45.150> I'm

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that okay so that it's halfway up if I'm

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.900 
that okay so that it's halfway up if I'm
looking<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> top<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.740> looks<00:01:47.670> like

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
looking at it from the top it looks like

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.910 
looking at it from the top it looks like
half<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.600> cooked<00:01:48.930> okay

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
half of it's cooked okay

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
half of it's cooked okay
so<00:01:50.220> again<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.640> gonna<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.330> way

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so again you're gonna put it in this way

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.780 
so again you're gonna put it in this way
and<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> twist<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.950> fork<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.490> it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and then you twist the fork so that it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.080 
and then you twist the fork so that it's
half<00:01:53.940> way<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.650> then<00:01:55.650> what<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.580> can't<00:01:56.880> see

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
half way up and then what you can't see

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
half way up and then what you can't see
from<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.450> angle<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.460> liquid

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
from that angle is that the the liquid

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.620 
from that angle is that the the liquid
part

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.180 

comes<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.320> starts<00:02:04.680> filling<00:02:04.890> up

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
comes out so that it starts filling up

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.529 
comes out so that it starts filling up
the<00:02:05.369> rest<00:02:05.550> of<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:05.880> let's<00:02:06.210> switch<00:02:06.360> sides

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
the rest of it so let's switch sides

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.219 
the rest of it so let's switch sides
here<00:02:07.140> yeah<00:02:08.119> okay<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.600> I'm<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.840> put<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> in

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
here yeah okay so I'm going to put it in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
here yeah okay so I'm going to put it in
and<00:02:10.470> twist<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.640> liquid<00:02:11.820> stays

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and twist it so that the liquid stays

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.970 
and twist it so that the liquid stays
down<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> well<00:02:13.140> down<00:02:13.440> there<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.860> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
down in the well down there and that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970 
down in the well down there and that
forms<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.060> next<00:02:15.330> part<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
forms the the next part of the the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.130 
forms the the next part of the the
aebleskiver<00:02:20.120> those<00:02:21.120> were<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:21.900> bit

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
aebleskiver those were just a little bit

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.340 
aebleskiver those were just a little bit
of<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.410> salt<00:02:26.330> these<00:02:27.330> are<00:02:27.570> turning<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.989> little<00:02:28.230> bit

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
of a salt these are turning a little bit

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.290 
of a salt these are turning a little bit
before<00:02:28.500> there<00:02:28.890> they're<00:02:29.370> ready<00:02:29.670> those<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
before there they're ready those the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.850 
before there they're ready those the
problem<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.870> these<00:02:31.080> they're<00:02:31.380> not<00:02:31.410> quite

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
problem with these they're not quite

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:41.830 
problem with these they're not quite
done<00:02:32.130> enough

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.180 

don't<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.960> okay<00:02:43.290> we'll<00:02:43.500> let<00:02:43.650> them<00:02:43.830> sit<00:02:44.130> a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
don't be okay we'll let them sit a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.400 
don't be okay we'll let them sit a
little<00:02:44.310> bit<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.880> other<00:02:45.140> ocean<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.380> a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
little bit in that other ocean for a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.620 
little bit in that other ocean for a
little<00:02:46.650> bit

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.480 

the<00:02:55.720> first<00:02:55.960> turn<00:02:56.200> except<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.740> half<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.310> its

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
the first turn except for half of its

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.790 
the first turn except for half of its
already<00:02:57.730> done<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.840> stick<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.320> fork<00:02:59.530> in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
already done so you stick the fork in

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.120 
already done so you stick the fork in
and<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.850> twist<00:03:01.210> it<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.410> see<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.830> the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
and you twist it and you see the the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.980 
and you twist it and you see the the
liquid<00:03:03.460> is<00:03:03.580> starting<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.090> run<00:03:04.240> out<00:03:04.270> down<00:03:04.750> that

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
liquid is starting to run out down that

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.100 
liquid is starting to run out down that
so<00:03:05.800> you're<00:03:05.920> twisting<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.630> again<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.840> that

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
so you're twisting it again that that

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.170 
so you're twisting it again that that
sort<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.500> 90<00:03:08.890> degrees<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:12.580> can<00:03:12.940> see<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
sort of 90 degrees and you can see the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.490 
sort of 90 degrees and you can see the
pen<00:03:13.360> that's<00:03:13.570> plenty<00:03:13.900> hot<00:03:14.050> enough<00:03:14.080> because

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
pen that's plenty hot enough because

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.780 
pen that's plenty hot enough because
we're<00:03:14.620> starting<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.400> golden

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
we're starting to get that golden

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.670 
we're starting to get that golden
golden-brown<00:03:17.760> bit<00:03:18.760> there<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.020> these<00:03:20.440> will<00:03:20.650> be

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
golden-brown bit there and these will be

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.160 
golden-brown bit there and these will be
ready<00:03:20.950> for<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.310> final<00:03:21.580> turn<00:03:21.970> probably<00:03:22.810> by<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
ready for the final turn probably by the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.200 
ready for the final turn probably by the
time<00:03:23.290> I'm<00:03:23.740> done<00:03:23.980> making<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.520> third<00:03:24.730> turn<00:03:25.030> on

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
time I'm done making the third turn on

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.880 
time I'm done making the third turn on
the<00:03:25.330> other<00:03:25.510> pan<00:03:25.780> all<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.500> other<00:03:26.620> pens<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> here

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
the other pan all the other pens so here

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.890 
the other pan all the other pens so here
this<00:03:30.040> pan<00:03:30.310> over<00:03:30.550> here<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.850> can<00:03:31.000> see<00:03:31.240> this

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
this pan over here you can see this

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.440 
this pan over here you can see this
wasn't<00:03:32.320> quite<00:03:32.560> as<00:03:32.740> done<00:03:33.010> enough<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:34.210> so<00:03:34.360> you

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
wasn't quite as done enough and so you

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.000 
wasn't quite as done enough and so you
can<00:03:34.570> see<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:34.840> kind<00:03:35.050> of<00:03:35.170> falling<00:03:35.440> in<00:03:35.590> it'll<00:03:35.890> be

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
can see it's kind of falling in it'll be

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.400 
can see it's kind of falling in it'll be
ok<00:03:36.430> after<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.970> make<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.450> second<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.260> third

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
ok after I make the second and third

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.380 
ok after I make the second and third
turns<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.490> I'm<00:03:39.580> just<00:03:39.700> gonna<00:03:39.880> kind<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.240> let

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
turns but I'm just gonna kind of let

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.440

come back over here and I'm putting the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.420 
come back over here and I'm putting the
fork<00:03:45.580> down<00:03:46.050> because<00:03:47.050> for<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.530> last<00:03:47.740> turn

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
fork down because for the last turn

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.550 
fork down because for the last turn
there's<00:03:49.060> no<00:03:49.240> way<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.420> stick<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> fork<00:03:49.930> into<00:03:50.380> it

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
there's no way to stick a fork into it

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.580 
there's no way to stick a fork into it
and<00:03:50.770> twist<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.220> have<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:51.760> hole<00:03:52.060> still

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and twist it and have that hole still

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.180 
and twist it and have that hole still
and<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:53.770> that<00:03:53.950> hole<00:03:54.160> get<00:03:54.340> filled<00:03:54.610> up<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:59.190> what

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
and have that hole get filled up so what

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.880 
and have that hole get filled up so what
you<00:04:00.310> do<00:04:00.490> is<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.230> just<00:04:02.470> kind<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.740> roll

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
you do is you is you just kind of roll

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.520 
you do is you is you just kind of roll
it<00:04:03.070> with<00:04:03.160> your<00:04:03.370> fingers<00:04:03.760> like<00:04:03.820> this<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:05.500> that

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
it with your fingers like this so that

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.390 
it with your fingers like this so that
that<00:04:05.980> triangle<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:07.120> facing<00:04:07.780> down<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.590> they

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
that triangle is facing down and they

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.220 
that triangle is facing down and they
are<00:04:09.430> kind<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.000> hot<00:04:10.180> because<00:04:10.660> they<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.020> course

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
are kind of hot because they of course

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.650 
are kind of hot because they of course
they're<00:04:11.470> being<00:04:11.650> cooked<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.280> take<00:04:13.180> somebody

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
they're being cooked so take somebody

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.160 
they're being cooked so take somebody
with<00:04:13.750> some<00:04:14.110> hands<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.560> are<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:16.450> little<00:04:16.930> bit

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
with some hands that are a little bit

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.830 
with some hands that are a little bit
unsensible<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:19.180> that<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.960> how<00:04:20.230> you<00:04:20.799> rotate

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
unsensible and that is how you rotate

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.880 
unsensible and that is how you rotate
aebleskiver<00:04:24.570> until<00:04:25.570> they're<00:04:25.720> cooked<00:04:25.930> just

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
aebleskiver until they're cooked just

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.310 
aebleskiver until they're cooked just
like<00:04:27.100> that
