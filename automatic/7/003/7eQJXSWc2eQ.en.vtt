video they're taking it back just by the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.849 
video they're taking it back just by the
data<00:03:06.750> rates<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.260> actually<00:03:07.470> being

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
data rates that are actually being

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.640 
data rates that are actually being
demonstrated<00:03:08.239> because<00:03:09.239> these<00:03:10.139> things<00:03:10.380> have

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
demonstrated because these things have

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.910 
demonstrated because these things have
not<00:03:10.769> been<00:03:10.980> seen<00:03:11.310> for<00:03:11.480> 4<00:03:12.480> HSPA<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.350> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
not been seen for 4 HSPA in the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.740 
not been seen for 4 HSPA in the
marketplace<00:03:14.489> or<00:03:14.790> even<00:03:15.090> demonstrated<00:03:15.569> before

marketplace or even demonstrated before

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.379 
marketplace or even demonstrated before
so<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:16.980> very<00:03:17.190> exciting<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.970> consumer

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
so it is very exciting for the consumer

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.569 
so it is very exciting for the consumer
and<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.630> an<00:03:19.100> exciting<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.340> exciting

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
and it's an exciting and it's exciting

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.479
