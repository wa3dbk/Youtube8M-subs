thought and the air valves in there were

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
thought and the air valves in there were
all<00:01:40.979> timed<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:43.350> tap<00:01:44.009> dance<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.119> sound

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
very sophisticated for 1967 i thought we

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.830 
very sophisticated for 1967 i thought we

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
exactly like he made it in 1967 when it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.700 
exactly like he made it in 1967 when it
starts<00:02:27.990> it's<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.610> surprise<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.930> you

kind<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.320> jump<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:35.040> bit<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
kind of jump a little bit and and it

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.690 
kind of jump a little bit and and it
draws<00:02:36.510> them<00:02:36.780> over<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> thing<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
draws them over there to the thing so I

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:50.370 
draws them over there to the thing so I
think<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.200> respect<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.600> magical
