more of base gel underneath so that way

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.929 
more of base gel underneath so that way
you<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.550> some<00:00:23.939> room<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> glitter<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
you have some room for the glitter to

up prepping the nails and do all the
basic<00:00:33.300> step<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.960> needed<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> nails

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
basic step that needed for the nails

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.090 
basic step that needed for the nails
including<00:00:36.680> apply<00:00:39.469> dehydrator<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> nails

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
including apply dehydrator on the nails

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.450 
including apply dehydrator on the nails
and<00:00:41.450> base<00:00:42.450> color<00:00:43.050> gel<00:00:43.559> base<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> nails

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and base color gel base for the nails

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.600 
and base color gel base for the nails
now<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.230> next<00:00:46.230> step<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.710> using<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
now the next step I'm using is going to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.869 
now the next step I'm using is going to
be<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.379> base<00:00:49.379> year<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.370> talking

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
be the base year that I was talking

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
be the base year that I was talking
about<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.780> normally<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.620> type<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> gel<00:00:53.250> will

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
about so normally this type of gel will

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.660 
about so normally this type of gel will
come<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> jar<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.340> like

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
come in the jar and you can use like

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.479 
come in the jar and you can use like
clear<00:00:57.239> butyl<00:00:57.690> gel<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.230> use<00:00:58.710> clear

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
clear butyl gel you can use clear

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.510 
clear butyl gel you can use clear
overlay<00:01:00.059> gel<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.770> any<00:01:01.770> jail<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.489> a

overlay gel or any jail that have a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640 
overlay gel or any jail that have a
little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.820> thicker<00:01:03.239> consistency<00:01:03.650> compared

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
little bit thicker consistency compared

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.359 
little bit thicker consistency compared
to<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.610> base<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.060> topcoat<00:01:06.900> gel<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.470> just

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
to just a base or topcoat gel and just

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.870 
to just a base or topcoat gel and just
generally<00:01:09.270> apply<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.900> nails<00:01:10.580> more<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
generally apply on the nails more like a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
generally apply on the nails more like a
push<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:13.400> technique<00:01:14.400> application<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:17.400> the

entire<00:01:18.119> nail<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.090> allow<00:01:21.650> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
entire nail this one will allow the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
entire nail this one will allow the
product<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.430> equator<00:01:23.909> later<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.509> when<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
product the equator later on when you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.950 
product the equator later on when you
apply<00:01:25.680> into<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> nails<00:01:26.689> more<00:01:27.799> adhesion<00:01:28.799> more

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
apply into the nails more adhesion more

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
apply into the nails more adhesion more
state<00:01:30.960> last<00:01:31.229> longer<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:32.729> give

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
state last longer and then also give

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.170 
state last longer and then also give
some<00:01:33.869> support<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.799> natural<00:01:35.700> nails<00:01:35.880> as

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the surface now smoother and it's give

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
the surface now smoother and it's give
me<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.540> texture<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.890> work<00:01:56.070> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
