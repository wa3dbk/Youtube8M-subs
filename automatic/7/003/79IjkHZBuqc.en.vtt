00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.160
 or the big sporadic piano kisses the 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.750
 I'm not going to teach you how to 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.849
 make the notifications that arrive 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.500
 on our phone reach our 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.790
 computer this is going to be very simple 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.310
 is going to be with this application that I have 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.439
 here it's called chrome and well this is going to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.269
 work with an extension that we have 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.070
 to install in our browser this 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.960
 browser is going to have to necessarily 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.029
 be chrome the name of the application does not 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.380
 says so good scrum with each 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.269
 this application has a cost of 10 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.150
 weights in the place bull then in 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.949
 reality is very very cheap and good 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.570
 to set the equal is very simple 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.559
 Once you open the application 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.449
 first time they will appear 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.210
 practically this the only thing that they have 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.879
 what to do is go to the configurations 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.070
 to activate the chrome service this is 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.690
 to let us be able to send the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.610
 notifications to the computer then 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.400
 when as you can see here chrome says 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.049
 and good is activated but good you 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.580
 They have to make sure it is 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.890
 activated always so that it works well 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.360
 the application once they do that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.400
 it simply squeezes you from who says 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.290
 next and good tells us that we have 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.180
 that download the whole there we have 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.480
 that go to this scrum point page 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.080
 efe pl or you can simply google 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.370
 chrome and download it in your browser and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.590
 as I tell you they necessarily have to 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.960
 be from chrome and good they are and here 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.970
 where it says next and it's going to give 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.500
 this code this code have it that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.690
 write on your computer if it is 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 is what I 'm going to do now in my code 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.430
 it is so that then write 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.650
 quickly 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.150
 ok once they write the code the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 computer they simply give in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.080
 confirm the new computer so 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.310
 we are connected and in a moment we have 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.070
 they say that on the phone we are already 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 connected we are going to give to who says 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.440
 finalize and once this is already 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 We will be able to receive notifications in 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.800
 our browser and good to know if 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 the application works well what 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.100
 we can do is send a notification 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.930
 and that's how one get all the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.670
 notifications to our browser 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.220
 chrome logically has to be 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.649
 always open the browser chrome well 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 how good we all are practically 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.310
 we always so open Chrome 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.140
 well let's send a notification of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 test as you see here it was activated and here in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.970
 my computer is the same notification 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.739
 and well logically that's the way it would be for all 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.360
 the applications and something that I liked 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.310
 much is that if you get a message from 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.890
 text this only works for the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.020
 messages you can answer from 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.090
 chrome you just touch the notification 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.830
 and you will be able to write from your 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.930
 computer and answer it from there without 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.130
 have to open your phone I would like 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.260
 that will work with things like 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.239
 whatsapp or the like but good not 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.430
 it works and well something that you can 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.940
 modify is here the applications that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.590
 you want 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.210
 in notifications and good here 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.100
 basically if I do not want to be reached 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.050
 notifications for example whatsapp 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.060
 because in reality they sometimes arrive 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.290
 too many messages together and all your 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.760
 computer to be full of 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.860
 notifications then when you can 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.900
 disable whatsapp or you can leave it 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
 activated as you want and good here 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.310
 same in the settings you can 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.270
 do it from text messages if the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.370
 you want to write from the computer 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.110
 I liked that a lot, so when I 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.460
 I recommend that you have it activated 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.400
 can have this that only 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.320
 when you are connected in wifi send the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.250
 notifications or also when you're in 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.930
 3g 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.570
 all this you can modify it from 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.070
 here and good is very very cheap 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.350
 application I highly recommend that the 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.270
 buy and well this would be all as in 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.040
 all my videos I ask you a like is the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.600
