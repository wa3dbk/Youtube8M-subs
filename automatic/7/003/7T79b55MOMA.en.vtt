00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.700
 Nine people alex father here and my name is 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.460
 is welcome you been a 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.230
 other med what is this one here 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.539
 round paintball we play now 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 Just a round paintball that is 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.940
 a call of duty modern warfare 1 j and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.920
 I found the 20 minutes ago and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.180
 I thought I have you there once 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.949
 we have actually arrived 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.019
 I definitely have to do that for you 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.910
 show is different maps it 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.470
 gives all game modes to specify this 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.019
 capture the flag domination and such 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.869
 continue and someone has stopped there 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:56.530
 times really hard and yes 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:01:00.530
 kaufhof the opponent also surely and 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.049
 because maps created different weapons 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:13.729
 classes and so on is really cool 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:15.470
 There is an actual need to get there 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.299
 every case like you see the weapons completely 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.460
 Acting very differently that means one 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.340
 must hold before you all know that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.409
 principle comes my god 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.420
 and it's going pretty well there 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.740
 good round like now I never had that 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.429
 I have died a hundred times 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.229
 yes, and he always has the 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.090
 Noise when loading so like 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.829
 said someone probably still 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.210
 baptized ex-professional buy that 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.789
 somebody was really trying 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.840
 and you'll see something awesome 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.390
 can come out 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.140
 There he has me baffled here if you 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.909
 does not put everything in chains that is the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.409
 Freedom sometimes I was one 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.009
 a little something to tinker and to own 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.880
 develop 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.560
 Yes and 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.869
 there's something cool out there and that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.039
 reminded me of the time as 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.019
 I did because he could not want to 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.700
 hurt the time when I am here too 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.230
 always played a murder in modern 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.790
 warfare 1 you could not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.650
 turn off in itself so you are not 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.360
 died but has frozen 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.160
 and the others could do one again 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.950
 Thawing that was pretty cool 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.300
 that has me forever the fun on the game 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.560
 Game received and pity I wanted with 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.780
 what to take down and not worked 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 and now I have found something again 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.120
 what's going to be real , I'll go 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.040
 strong from out of that again 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.370
 So play longer player level 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.180
 animal also you see i am the 45th 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.690
 and you have your own 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.030
 levelystem selection just because you 're at 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.500
 normal mode level 50 since that is called 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.180
 not that it says here, quite the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.400
 contrary we start at zero 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:59.060
 hold lines and have to 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.220
 then level up to then also the 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.420
 whole classes and weapons and the like 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.730
 I have somebody to unlock me 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.079
 great tinkering was the change or 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.150
 in this class we change then 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.780
 The next round was going to be me 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.160
 never should 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.160
 He did not want to shoot me 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.500
 the tripping always not bad 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.450
 but has in not much ammunition 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.829
 diakonie and there are also 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.829
 different maps so I am now 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.709
 I've already several apps 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.260
 downloaded 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.780
 nevertheless, it can happen twice 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.639
 shoot because yes the things are coming 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.090
 we have to come later that he 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.049
 no ball as it is in the normal 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.980
 Mode is the case 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.350
 and there are just big forest maps, so to speak 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.160
 the grenades are the way up 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.859
 facts 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.389
 There are big forest maps on there you 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.549
 everything can be on the way 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.950
 really great even after paintball 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.700
 pretty and now stocks or that is 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.700
 still on grenade 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:11.829
 take care that nothing is trying here 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.200
 let's have a look at the shotgun 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.730
 by the way, very cool here 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.199
 that is also with scotland 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.220
 I think it's very cool you can 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.780
 Let me tell you something about them 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.060
 actions you think I think that is 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.830
 In any case , the sense of power and offered 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.990
 the fun makes compared to the 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.360
 where you can just get newtown ten 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.280
 millions of years playing or something vasic 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.770
 schweina good 1 seems to be so with us 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.720
 many of it millions of servers 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.970
 But I find something always meaningless 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.970
 okay, that never comes up there 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.280
 Yes , I also caught him 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.910
 and if you want to see more of it then 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.919
 I show it more and more down there 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.009
 say shit 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.660
 There is also if you want that if you are 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.190
 mean if i believe my hearing here 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.280
 may there is also fully automatic 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.650
 Weapons are not accepted there 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.550
 also fully automatic weapons and the 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.440
 I have to stop me anyway 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.880
 free games and then sees that 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.360
 maybe even a corner better than 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.510
 what I am right now, however 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.590
 also one of my very first rounds 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.360
 it's the third round I think 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.210
 Play on two other website so far 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.669
 very small still and one 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.940
 huge walter or forest 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.650
 and meadow I would like to call yes 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.449
 also determined not caught 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.880
 air shock move is not so 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.610
 many go to the piece that made me 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.449
 can try that would have on the the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.449
 grenade maybe 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.969
 we always go a bit left 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.800
 on the right , yes, the enemy is displaced 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.449
 is accordingly hard for us 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.610
 there are also knives like that 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.860
 Just a fist that's definite 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.869
 an automatic one hears that 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.949
 already worth sound was loud enough 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.899
 make her a little bit too 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.169
 from the soundscape mitkriegt is the 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:07.039
 yes relatively quiet but now down 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.039
 jump since nothing happens 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.330
 I almost thought that was not 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.100
 well, ok, we have that up 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.390
 determined we still learn I have 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.420
 no idea after one and a half rounds 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:22.020
 has minutes then it's over and over 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.000
 then you are allowed to do this the video 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.980
 Let's tell if you know about it 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.390
 I want to see more on each one 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.310
 fall cool i will definitely 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.500
 play more often and if you are 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:38.370
 then you want to tell me then 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:43.500
 I take on grenade well 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:50.790
 also work, we also have 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:52.950
 a drone out, yes, probably also 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.990
 get caught one has sometime the 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:59.450
 then turn out like these cartridges this 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.450
 Color bombs this color ball next to fly 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.560
 Sometimes it does not burst if you do 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.030
 the feeling you have the turn out like 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.980
 It looks like it's leading at the moment 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.000
 this works better than normal 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:16.500
 ruler popular jawoll so the same 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.730
 warded off and on we go the 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.890
 next here is just a series 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.610
 the names are ok so i would like too 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:29.979
 not so much to load berlin 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:39.490
 are 200 balls from the outset in it 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:41.800
 he caught me the grenade had him 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.240
 yes, so here is so here now must 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.210
 I will say that he above 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.159
 Back the dead end it does it right 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.300
 make you moody veronika 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:51.159
 sometimes suggest 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.569
 because he can play with it at the moment 

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:54.520
 do not start anymore but that is 

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:55.840
 Of course, something you can do 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.729
 can try because that is one 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.139
 quite a different game feel so how 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:01.539
 if you want to see more of it 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.250
 if you liked 23 12 is 

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:05.770
 totally okay in two akw I would 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.870
 say here then yes let me 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.539
 rating there tells me in the comments 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.800
 how you found that and then 

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:16.050
 I'll see you at the next video 

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.050
 again until then your alex pato
