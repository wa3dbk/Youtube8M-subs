throw<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> other<00:01:41.040> battery<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> put

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
throw the other battery in so you put

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.569 
throw the other battery in so you put
the<00:01:43.290> OEM<00:01:43.560> battery<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> device<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.520> then

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the OEM battery in the device and then

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.800 
the OEM battery in the device and then
you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:44.909> put<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> extended

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you can actually put the extended

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.109 
you can actually put the extended
battery<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.009> fine<00:01:47.280> charge

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
battery in here it's just fine charge

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
battery in here it's just fine charge
that<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.750> always<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> go

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
time to charge in between which is very

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 
time to charge in between which is very
cool<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.280> last<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.329> least<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.869> see

here the same deal in my bold 9700 and
we<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> battery<00:02:01.710> life<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
we know the battery life on this is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.209 
we know the battery life on this is
amazing<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:04.649> OEM<00:02:05.009> size

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
fifteen percent more battery life I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
fifteen percent more battery life I
she<00:02:12.150> used<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.630> about<00:02:12.660> 14<00:02:13.140> hours<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.560> other

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
she used it for about 14 hours the other

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.100 
she used it for about 14 hours the other
day<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.160> had<00:02:14.910> about<00:02:15.360> fifty-five<00:02:15.930> percent

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
day and had about fifty-five percent

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.260 
day and had about fifty-five percent
battery<00:02:16.500> life<00:02:16.800> left<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.700> gives<00:02:18.090> you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
battery life left so so it gives you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.870 
battery life left so so it gives you
quite<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> ways<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> same

quite a ways and you can do the same
here<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> extra<00:02:21.660> battery<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.230> charge<00:02:22.560> it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
here put the extra battery and charge it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.020 
here put the extra battery and charge it
up<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.100> always<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.459> another<00:02:23.670> battery

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
up so you always have another battery

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.960 
up so you always have another battery
that's<00:02:24.209> good<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> go<00:02:24.890> then<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
micro USB these are great to have around

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
micro USB these are great to have around
for<00:02:37.770> syncing<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.310> charging<00:02:38.730> or<00:02:38.850> anything<00:02:39.090> like

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
for syncing or charging or anything like

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.900 
for syncing or charging or anything like
that<00:02:39.650> they're<00:02:40.650> very<00:02:40.860> small<00:02:41.190> easy<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.700> carry

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that they're very small easy to carry

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.729 
that they're very small easy to carry
around<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.900> throw<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.230> pocket<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
around and throw it in your pocket and

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.729 
around and throw it in your pocket and
they<00:02:44.010> actually<00:02:44.160> pull<00:02:44.519> out<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.470> just

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
they actually pull out and you can just

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.050 
they actually pull out and you can just
tuck<00:02:46.920> them<00:02:47.070> give<00:02:47.250> them<00:02:47.340> rather<00:02:47.459> track<00:02:47.790> there

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
tuck them give them rather track there

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.520 
tuck them give them rather track there
so<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.600> better<00:02:48.780> than<00:02:48.959> having<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.260> cable

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so it's better than having the cable

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.509 
so it's better than having the cable
that<00:02:49.620> came<00:02:49.709> with<00:02:49.769> your<00:02:49.950> device<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.400> don't

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
that came with your device you don't

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.440 
that came with your device you don't
have<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> worry<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:50.880> anything<00:02:51.150> getting

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
have to worry about anything getting
