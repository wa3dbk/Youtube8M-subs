Today on "Does This Work?"

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.600
A practical watermelon, pineapple and melon slicer

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.860
This product we bought at Amazon
and paid the value of ¥ 2,588

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.600
Approximately 23.04 USD

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.380
It's expensive?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.060
HMMM, it's expensive, right !?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.500
♪ Let's open ♪

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Full of Scotch tape, I did not like this box, not at all

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.980
Wow, look at the size of it from here.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.180
(Simulating Car Sound)

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.180
Now I know where this one came from, look

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.160
than it's the apple cutter, was born from this one

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.060
Now we will never have any problem to cut the apple, just use this one

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.800
The size difference is this that you are now seeing in video

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.960
Watermelon slicer is almost the same as apple slicer, only bigger

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.640
It is made of plastic and has these slides here in the center so we can press and slice the watermelon

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.660
Melon and pineapple too

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.580
Despite this slicer here it's made for watermelon to me thinking he is a bit small

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.180
for the size of a watermelon, can it?

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.740
Let's go to the kitchen!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.380
This tiny watermelon here we find in the market
and pay the amount of ¥ 500

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.100
It's called Kodoma Suika
Is good because it gives the size of the cutter

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.680
Last time we took a bigger apple and didn't work

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.720
This time I took a tiny watermelon

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.960
First I because we will see if women can cut this watermelon

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.620
Every time we buy a watermelon that has to cut, I call to cut Lohgann

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.420
Because I have no strength, I am weak

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.460
Then if it works this product is very good, let's go then

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.900
Three two one

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.280
Ah, but looks like I'm going to break this thing!

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.760
Come on, take a time, I'm afraid of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.660
I think this slicer will break

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660
(Metal grinding)

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.380
Aahh, to thinking that I will break this cutter!

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.720
I'm afraid
it's making a strange noise

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.380
He made a little mark above the watermelon
The deal're all

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.700
Cracked!
Wow, what is this strange watermelon, it is yellow.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.760
What, watermelon cracked ?!

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.660
(Laughter in the background)

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.620
Here, it's cracking here also

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.780
(Power moans)

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.560
Oh, sliced!

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.980
Watermelon is yellow, what the heck is that?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.680
It has to experience, it is yellow

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.420
It's good! Wow, that's hot!

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.760
it worked

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.500
Lohgann: The Prit had to do a lot of strength to cut this watermelon and her cracked first before cutting

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.180
But separated the right buds
Is it easy to take away?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.820
No

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.460
're more or less, right. Do not cut just right
has done damage to watermelon, actually

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.540
Prit: What is this watermelon, yellow?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.620
Lohgann: This is a watermelon selling here in Japan, also I do not know

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.760
It is a yellow watermelon, did not know she was yellow,
I thought it was red

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.000
Prit: First time I see a yellow watermelon,
have it in another country?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.380
Lohgann: And so it was our watermelon

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.680
...Yellow

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.540
And now, we're going to test with melon

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.180
In the box drawing you see a piece cut melon,
perhaps to facilitate cutting

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.600
But we do not have a big enough knife to do it,
then we'll try to cut a piece

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.060
This melon seems easier, come on!

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.360
"This is Sparta"

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.180
It is very easy, hallelujah!

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.420
Prit: My, how good was the melon look,
let me try to get here

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.660
...wait not go out...

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.780
Come.... What do I do? 
Come on! She came out a bit here. I like it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.080
You have to give a break here,
maybe below had also cut a piece

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.000
Because Its broken here,
Would be good if the watermelon have cut underneath?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.440
At the time I'll take the pieces are breaking
because it was not really until the end

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.280
You can see that he's caught here,
I tried to take a tight little here, but does not reach

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.100
How our melon stayed,
this piece here's a ugly little thing, right?

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.980
Looking for the rest did not waste much melon,
I think right

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.620
I quite liked the product, it worked fine

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.520
By the time I was cutting watermelon
I heard some strange noises and thought this part here

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.400
about the product that was breaking, but it is not.
Because the blades were entering the watermelon rind

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.760
And I was doing a means strange noise
I was afraid, but so I could slice watermelon

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.360
Split / cut right

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.600
Now with this product I can slice alone,
at least the watermelons are yellow inside

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.600
I quite liked this product,
I found it very practical to slice melon and we realized

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.140
It's time to cut that to get that cap the two sides
will further facilitate cutting

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.700
Although the product is very good I do not know if it really pays to be bought because it is too expensive

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.280
But for you who eat enough fruits of this type,
these large, hard-to-cut fruits

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.980
I think this here worth a lot

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.200
What I could also see that there is a difference
between slicing those fruits

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.440
In watermelon it seemed a little hard,
but to slice the melon was rather easy and also soft

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.980
I think anyone can slice

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.760
Approved!

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.660
What do you think about this huge product
to slice large fruits?

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.040
Did you know? Did you already used?
