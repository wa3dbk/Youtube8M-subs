00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.500
 hello with you egor and today happened 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.780
 incredible after three months 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.610
 Apple testings so released 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.619
 final build a with 71 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.600
 and about all the major innovations i 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.250
 I will tell here in this video in the first 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.529
 queue worth paying attention to 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.359
 speed of aires besides the fact that 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.490
 she began to work tolerantly on old 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.369
 devices here i'm talking about fourth 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.079
 iphone or old ipad it was essential 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.760
 accelerated animation so that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.670
 it feels like already 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.890
 fast iphone 5s works even faster 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.080
 moreover some were redrawn 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.420
 interface elements now say the menu 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.760
 Turning off the phone looks like this 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.430
 when an incoming call, we will see something 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.900
 like this one more 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.970
 some changes in function 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.800
 universal access such as fat 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.990
 keyboard font motion reduction 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.300
 Such programs are weather messages and 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.910
 other little things have been changed 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.190
 the keyboard I do not know about you 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.199
 It seems the animation of the shift button of some kind 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.720
 wrong for three months and to her so and 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.909
 could not get used but again to someone 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.740
 may she still like it besides 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.990
 It has become possible to include or 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.609
 turn off the effect of floating wallpaper for 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.890
 this is enough when choosing shoes 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.719
 turn perspective on or off 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.999
 from other little things can also be noted 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.039
 transfer settings pockets in the main menu 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:27.490
 settings and keychain support in 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.049
 Ukraine and come out of 70 a bunch of keys in 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.929
 Ukraine was included after some 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.909
 dance with a tambourine and now everything works ok 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.729
 among other things there were several nomina 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.770
 the camera and now the opportunity 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.329
 hdr auto power on unclear 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.740
 why did it do it for a long time to us 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.450
 finally function appeared 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.549
 notice of the automatic cleaning 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.310
 call storks if you took a call 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.319
 on another device russian siri you 71 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 so did not appear but it fell not to forget 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.490
 grind it for supported countries 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.109
 a new more was presented 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.569
 natural sound male and female 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.069
 votes for many countries besides 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.109
 now you can manually 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.360
 control on dictation text for 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.580
 this 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.860
 just press and hold the computer button 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.780
 someone ask me something before 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.170
 the series determined when you finished your 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.660
 the job 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.400
 exclusively automatically also with 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.210
 sim one function has been implemented 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.280
 carplay 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.100
 carplay is the ability to use 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.070
 Such features are sharp card phone music 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.930
 message on the car display in order 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.330
 to use it besides you 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.790
 support of the plant itself need support 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.560
 car head system therefore not 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 I think that today is tomorrow, many 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.400
 users will be able to feel everything 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.250
 the delights of new features as well 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.260
 concerns such as Toyota mercedes volvo 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.360
 and others have declared support for carplay 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.280
 I think in the foreseeable future, everything can 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.260
 Itâ€™s better to change 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.209
 fingerprint recognition tachadi 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.850
 and naturally dropped promise significantly 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.709
 and a general increase in stability 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.840
 the idea must mean 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.300
 far fewer random 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.040
 application crashes from interesting yet 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.200
 worth noting the firmware files 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.959
 mentions of new to date 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.480
 unknown versions of ipad and I think at all 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.180
 we will soon find out what this means 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.010
 then it turned out and weight 71 of course 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.630
 there are some very small ones 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.370
 changes that might have been missed or 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.290
 just do not tell so as not to take away 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.510
 your time for example changes in 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.980
 calendar and or improvement in this with radio 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.280
 which are not officially in Russia 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.080
 not running if suddenly there is something else 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.330
 interesting than all the same was worth saying 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.010
 be sure to share in the comments in 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.019

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.420
 recommended for installation and here in this 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.580
