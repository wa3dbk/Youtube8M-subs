00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.960 

well<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:01.829> should<00:00:02.100> have<00:00:02.190> give<00:00:02.280> that<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> few<00:00:02.700> extra

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
well I should have give that a few extra

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.670 
well I should have give that a few extra
seconds<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.570> gear<00:00:03.959> just<00:00:04.170> popped<00:00:04.440> right<00:00:04.560> off

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
seconds that gear just popped right off

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.559 
seconds that gear just popped right off
of<00:00:05.009> there<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.400> didn't<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.060> really<00:00:06.390> do

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
of there I didn't have to really do

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.390 
of there I didn't have to really do
anything<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.319> once<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.280> did<00:00:08.460> all<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.179> stuff

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
anything and once it did all this stuff

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.709 
anything and once it did all this stuff
came<00:00:11.400> pouring<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.830> there<00:00:13.830> are<00:00:13.860> no

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
came pouring out and there are no

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.430 
came pouring out and there are no
bushings<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.960> think<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.320> they're

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
bushings I think that's what they're

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.269 
bushings I think that's what they're
called<00:00:16.680> inside<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> there<00:00:17.640> see<00:00:17.910> those<00:00:19.279> three

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
called inside of there see those three

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
called inside of there see those three
circle<00:00:20.670> spots<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> triangle<00:00:21.930> that's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
circle spots of the triangle that's

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.750 
circle spots of the triangle that's
where<00:00:22.680> they're<00:00:23.130> supposed<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.430> something

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
where they're supposed to be something

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.900 
where they're supposed to be something
like<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.359> there<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.730> pile

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
like that in there and it's just a pile

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.959 
like that in there and it's just a pile
of<00:00:26.939> rubble<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:29.179> I<00:00:31.460> just<00:00:32.460> wanted<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> show<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of rubble so I just wanted to show you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.889 
of rubble so I just wanted to show you
that<00:00:34.309> I'm<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.180> clean<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> assembly

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
that I'm going to clean up the assembly

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
that I'm going to clean up the assembly
put<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> new<00:00:40.079> pieces<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:43.700> start

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
put the new pieces in and start

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
put the new pieces in and start
reassembly<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:47.780> I'm<00:00:48.780> gonna<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
reassembly on that I'm gonna have to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
reassembly on that I'm gonna have to
drill<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.550> stupid<00:00:51.059> holes<00:00:51.300> something

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
drill out these stupid holes something

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.400 
drill out these stupid holes something
I've<00:00:51.989> never<00:00:52.140> done<00:00:52.260> before<00:00:55.399> hopefully<00:00:57.410> won't

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
I've never done before hopefully won't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
I've never done before hopefully won't
be<00:00:58.559> too<00:00:58.800> tricky<00:01:00.289> in<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.469> word<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:02.160> springs

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
be too tricky in other word to springs

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.390 
be too tricky in other word to springs
inside<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:05.070> did<00:01:05.250> come<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:07.369> when<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
inside of here that did come out when I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.600 
inside of here that did come out when I
was<00:01:08.670> removing<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:12.590> was<00:01:13.590> pulling<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> shaft

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
was removing I was pulling the the shaft

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.210 
was removing I was pulling the the shaft
out<00:01:17.299> right<00:01:18.439> inside<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:20.630> there's<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
out right inside of here there's a

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.090 
out right inside of here there's a
spring<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.670> sorry

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
spring in here sorry

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.120 
spring in here sorry
spring<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.869> slots

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.910 

these<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.610> were<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.880> top<00:01:33.860> oops

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.080 

fabricated<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.070> things<00:01:38.490> per<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
fabricated these things per the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.319 
fabricated these things per the
directions<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.259> guess<00:01:40.439> they're<00:01:41.150> I'm<00:01:42.150> gonna

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
directions I guess they're I'm gonna

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.560 
directions I guess they're I'm gonna
hold<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> springs<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:44.509> for<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
hold the springs in for the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.819 
hold the springs in for the
reinstallation<00:01:48.110> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:50.490> lose<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.649> am

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
reinstallation if you do lose like I am

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.999

looking make sure I didn't lose if you
do<00:01:56.310> lose<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.549> Springs<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.390> heard<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.930> use

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
do lose your Springs I heard you can use

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.039

the<00:01:59.189> ball<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> ballpoint<00:02:00.799> pins<00:02:01.799> spring<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.960> I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the ball a ballpoint pins spring if I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.940 
the ball a ballpoint pins spring if I
have<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> cut<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> proper<00:02:04.979> length<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
have to cut it to the proper length but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.700 
have to cut it to the proper length but
yeah<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.190> where<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.550> at
