 and holden men and women merli players 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.039
 the whole world is stage and all women 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.920
 and men mere players of this famous 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 sentence forms the prelude to the 39 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.689
 hamburger ballet days with shakespeare 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.609
 that it is John Neumeier's choreographic 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.160
 editing with all your errors 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.160
 confusions of deceptions and disguises 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 to be in the new composition 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 three short versions of neumeiers 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 shakespeare ballets showed the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 already in the past decades 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 have arisen 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.000
 The difficulty for the evening was one 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.430
 short form of finding pieces 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 to distill her essence to her 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.030
 to bump into it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.129
 it had to be choreographed over and over 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.140
 new beginnings 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.140
 and yet many things remained original 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.860
 the connecting element the so-called 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.110
 forming red thread between the pieces 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.900
 the figure of the jack looks like you 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.990
 like being danced by carsten jung 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.820
 the first soloist of the ensemble in john 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.619
 neumeier's narrative is a dreamy one 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.690
 student in the course of the evening 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.500
 different roles and takes 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.500
 the value leads 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 interesting is the different 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.230
 Choreographic style of the three ballets 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.670
 can be found in the first part of the evening 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.740
 ornate Baroque forms transformations 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.630
 cladding presents the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.240
 second act on the music of michael tippett 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.520
 illustrated by danceable clear forms 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.940
 and from a broken society 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.940
 could 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.510
 tells neumeier just touching yet 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 the beginnings of love between the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.890
 Danish prince Hamlet and his on 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.810
 elia breaks the love of the two in the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.520
 Run the evening and evolve 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.520
 to tragedy increasingly 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.390
 the third act a romantic night 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.050
 dream shakespeares what you want as 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.760
 template 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.920
 In it, John Neumeier unites his 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.200
 artful narrative the from the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.610
 saxon confusion a dance 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.610
 symphony 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.170
 vivaldi's music is intense 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.450
 moments of pure dance in which the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.450
 figures come to life without a voice 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.800
 each of the individual pieces works for 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.760
 timeless and with these succinct ones 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.710
 short versions of his ballets to 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.900
 different times have arisen 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.550
 john neumeier has this shakespeare 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.550
 World lent his own life 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.950
 At the end, all the characters gather together 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.350
 on stage for a big finale 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.990
 when it says the whole world is stage 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.990
 and all women and men are mere players
