 also complicated because you have to have a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 let's say download once I have it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.220
 downloaded we give it to extract we use 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.810
 seven zip or rar 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:16.350
 ok not distracted we open did setup 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 next accepts and then paintings schiller where 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.549
 we want it to install if you don't 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.229
 you have changed nothing in the moment 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 of the installation of gta san andreas 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.740
 fate next has registered in other places 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.070
 you have to make the browser search for the card 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 you had to put it ok we go ahead 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.979
 next is always next and then install which 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.990
 this error will come out however there is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.680
 worry it's normal how you do 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 ignore ok then finished install also 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:53.299
 the 4 ok always next or you have to put 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.299
 still the anti destination card 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:02.159
 this next also which standard you make 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.270
 ignore in now and ignore ok completed 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.740
 klose 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.560
 now if we go to see on 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.959
 gta san andreas folder 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.610
 there will be this new cleo folder 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.010
 before there was none here 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 we will have to put all the echo files 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.560
 mode cleo 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.210
 now let's take an example a motorcycle is 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.040
 normal a mod of the clergy then ad 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.130
 example how many players we can 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.050
 put one of this we want 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.750
 now let's see which ones I can put not 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.260
 I know these things that I believe are the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.370
 more beautiful 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.770
 it seems to me installed once then 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.030
 could say install the game 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.220
 this co practically allows you to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.290
 open this menu where you can choose 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.640
 all the cars all alleys I have to do 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:00.050
 to churn out ok always so now let's go 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.220
 on download here we always see extract 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.459
 through senses with winrar ok we find ourselves 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:13.880
 here so you see there are two vehicle rows 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:17.269
 bully punto csr icall pound gxt fx ok 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.430
 then that cs we'll have to put in 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.239
 this folder without putting in one of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.190
 these plays we copy and paste 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.630
 answer if you want to do as you like 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.220
 I do so in a way that there is anyway 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.010
 a backup and this too, however 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.830
 we have to copy in text open inside 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.780
 and this mode is installed 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.120
 however, if you have not understood, I am here 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.180
 very simple instructions in Italian 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.190
 also tells us the keys that serve to 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.590
 as for the first seven activates 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.269
 menu ok and this way we have it 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.860
 installed now we are looking for another one 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:04:00.350
 normal mode or another aspect maybe 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:04.010
 there is another beautiful love makes fa vÃ¨ meanwhile 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.019
 switch to the bikes do not disturb ok now 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.269
 we install the generic bike that it is 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.390
 this that practically improves you 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:15.500
 graphic that you can see is just more 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:19.630
 cool of the original game always download 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.180
 we open we extract it 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.880
 remains among the files 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:32.270
 ok ok instead these files as how 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.710
 you can see there is no cs point and this 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:41.780
 because it was xt it looks sexy to me then 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:45.800
 we have to put copy the end files are 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.330
 indispensable we do copy and paste 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.310
 in here 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.770
 ok perfect so this way too is 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.630
 been installed now I open game vi 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.390
 I show that they have been installed 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.050
 so see you soon ok guys 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.880
 here we are on the game now I will show you that 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:08.240
 everything works perfectly if sphere 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.550
 initial with the sailing song 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:21.470
 brings back many memories 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:24.440
 ok here we are the menu key was 7 ok 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:29.540
 perfect then we move with the arrows 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:33.410
 directional or white and we press space 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.740
 on the category where we want PCs with 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:42.500
 the machines with the letter a life from 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:47.570
 rm from mrs or the trailer not above is that 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:50.060
 fuck but also partly to mostly 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:56.990
 play as then as you can see 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:58.490
 works are all there as I think 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.510
 after it finishes right away I will go to 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.760
 then commit suicide with these plans 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.169
 everything works we have the space for 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:15.020
 therefore, choosing what we want is 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:16.760
 nothing and this way too much there is 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.289
 find 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.120
 because then to select it there 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.120
 let's try it ok 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:30.770
 and this is the mode to bring back 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:34.039
 vehicle instead for the kraft and was shift 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:41.419
 more judges of the eternal graphic is 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:43.749
 exchanged to callers from the other type 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.060
 no because it is not really well done 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:50.240
 even one thing I am blurred believe you will 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.430
 the opposite side of fashion that can be 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.840
 see also this always works for 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:59.930
 turn it off shift which 12 found yes 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.710
 ok nothing then renders video 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.180
 conclude here I like it if you don't have it 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.669
 understood what was not a 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.969
 comment and see you in this 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.389
