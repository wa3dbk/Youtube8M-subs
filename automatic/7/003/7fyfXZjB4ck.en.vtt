you can do in 30 seconds so I'm going to
explain<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.770> do<00:02:20.980> them<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.220> you

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
explain to you how you do them so you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.670 
explain to you how you do them so you
basically<00:02:21.430> want<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.060> your<00:02:22.630> feet<00:02:23.260> kind<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
basically want to have your feet kind of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640 
basically want to have your feet kind of
hip<00:02:23.920> width<00:02:24.130> apart<00:02:24.840> roughly<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.500> you're

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
hip width apart roughly and then you're

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.170 
hip width apart roughly and then you're
basically<00:02:26.740> going<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.130> come<00:02:27.280> down<00:02:27.610> into<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
basically going to come down into the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.960 
basically going to come down into the
squat<00:02:28.390> position<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.200> then<00:02:29.710> back<00:02:29.920> up<00:02:30.130> again<00:02:30.460> so

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
squat position and then back up again so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.820 
squat position and then back up again so
it's<00:02:31.090> basically<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.110> make<00:02:32.800> sure

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
it's basically just like this make sure

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.010 
it's basically just like this make sure
your<00:02:33.220> knees<00:02:33.430> don't<00:02:33.670> come<00:02:33.940> over<00:02:33.970> your<00:02:34.360> toes<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
your knees don't come over your toes and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.050 
your knees don't come over your toes and
you<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:35.950> want<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.160> bend<00:02:36.370> down<00:02:36.580> into<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
you just want to bend down into the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.850 
you just want to bend down into the
squat<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:38.020> we're<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.320> see<00:02:38.440> how<00:02:38.470> many<00:02:38.680> we

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
squat so we're going to see how many we

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.949 
squat so we're going to see how many we
can<00:02:39.070> do<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.430> 30<00:02:39.730> seconds<00:02:40.240> I'm<00:02:40.420> your<00:02:40.630> time<00:02:40.810> it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.509 

456<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.650> guys<00:02:54.769> might<00:02:54.980> be<00:02:55.010> doing<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.340> at<00:02:55.489> a

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
456 you guys might be doing this at a

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:04.979 
456 you guys might be doing this at a
different<00:02:55.849> pace<00:02:55.970> seven<00:02:56.690> eight<00:02:58.120> nine<00:03:02.409> ten

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
different pace seven eight nine ten

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.650 
different pace seven eight nine ten
eleven<00:03:05.989> five<00:03:06.230> more<00:03:06.470> seconds<00:03:06.860> left<00:03:07.129> 12<00:03:09.580> 13<00:03:10.660> boom

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
eleven five more seconds left 12 13 boom

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.780 
eleven five more seconds left 12 13 boom
there<00:03:12.230> we<00:03:12.260> go<00:03:12.530> okay<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.099> next<00:03:13.400> time<00:03:13.640> we're

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
there we go okay so next time we're

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670 
there we go okay so next time we're
doing<00:03:13.940> 30<00:03:14.239> seconds<00:03:14.720> worth<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.019> tiptoe<00:03:15.410> squad

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
doing 30 seconds worth of tiptoe squad

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.990 
doing 30 seconds worth of tiptoe squad
so<00:03:15.829> it's<00:03:15.950> basically<00:03:16.099> exactly<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.700> same<00:03:16.849> as<00:03:16.940> we

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
so it's basically exactly the same as we

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.250 
so it's basically exactly the same as we
did<00:03:17.090> before<00:03:17.150> except<00:03:17.750> you're<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> be<00:03:18.110> up
