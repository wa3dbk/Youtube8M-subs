00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.320 
doesn't look too bad and you have I
believe<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.800> proximity<00:03:17.250> sensor<00:03:17.489> right<00:03:18.120> there

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
believe the proximity sensor right there

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.220 
believe the proximity sensor right there
the<00:03:18.510> facetime<00:03:19.020> camera<00:03:19.400> see<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.640> turns<00:03:20.910> on

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
the facetime camera see if it turns on

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.390 
the facetime camera see if it turns on
probably<00:03:22.230> have<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.410> power<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.800> up<00:03:22.860> at<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> top

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
probably have to power it up at the top

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.729 
probably have to power it up at the top
like<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.700> normal<00:03:24.090> iphone<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:25.200> seems<00:03:25.500> to
