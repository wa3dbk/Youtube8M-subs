and<00:01:55.050> flour<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.490> using<00:01:56.700> half<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.479> stick<00:01:57.690> of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
and flour so I'm using half a stick of

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.719 
and flour so I'm using half a stick of
butter<00:01:57.990> which<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.530> about<00:01:58.800> four<00:01:59.490> tablespoons

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
butter which is about four tablespoons

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.700 
butter which is about four tablespoons
and<00:02:00.680> once<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.890> melts<00:02:02.400> i'm<00:02:02.550> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> add<00:02:02.970> a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and once this melts i'm going to add a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.590 
and once this melts i'm going to add a
quarter<00:02:04.710> cup<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.240> flour<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:09.360> is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
quarter cup of flour and and this is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.330 
quarter cup of flour and and this is
what<00:02:09.810> makes<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.320> roux<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.830> rule<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
what makes the roux and the rule is the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.050 
what makes the roux and the rule is the
sickening<00:02:11.790> agent<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.690> sauce<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.850> want

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
sickening agent in a sauce and you want

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.920 
sickening agent in a sauce and you want
to<00:02:15.180> keep<00:02:15.420> your<00:02:15.780> heat<00:02:17.360> relatively<00:02:18.360> low<00:02:18.600> because

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
to keep your heat relatively low because

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
to keep your heat relatively low because
you<00:02:19.110> don't<00:02:19.380> want<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.680> butter<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.130> burn<00:02:20.340> okay

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
you don't want your butter to burn okay

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
you don't want your butter to burn okay

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
flour and stir this around and this is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.280 
flour and stir this around and this is
going<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> brown<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.600> bit<00:02:30.989> before

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.430 

this<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.850> exactly<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.570> reason<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.960> love<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> use

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
this is exactly the reason I love to use

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.400 
this is exactly the reason I love to use
what<00:02:49.300> round-bottom<00:02:50.300> Japan's<00:02:50.720> because<00:02:51.290> you

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
what round-bottom Japan's because you

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.340 
what round-bottom Japan's because you
can<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.340> none<00:02:53.240> of<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.510> flower<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:54.140> going

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
can see that none of the flower is going

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.800 
can see that none of the flower is going
to<00:02:54.440> get<00:02:54.650> stuck<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.520> sides<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.300> pan<00:02:56.330> if

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
to get stuck in the sides of the pan if

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.180 
to get stuck in the sides of the pan if
they<00:02:57.020> were<00:02:57.080> called<00:02:57.910> horizontal<00:02:59.080> and<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:00.800> whisk

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
they were called horizontal and my whisk

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.250 
they were called horizontal and my whisk
can<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:02.420> easily<00:03:04.210> go<00:03:05.210> around<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.870> when<00:03:05.900> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
can just easily go around is when it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.140 
can just easily go around is when it
closed<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.650> saucepan<00:03:07.220> I'm<00:03:07.490> making<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.940> sauce

closed in a saucepan I'm making a sauce

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.410 
closed in a saucepan I'm making a sauce
and<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.350> usually<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.850> make<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.210> with

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and then usually you can make this with

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.000 
and then usually you can make this with
milk<00:03:11.690> skim<00:03:12.110> milk<00:03:12.320> i'm<00:03:12.590> going<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:12.890> use

milk skim milk i'm going to use

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.890 
milk skim milk i'm going to use
half-and-half<00:03:13.310> only<00:03:14.120> because<00:03:14.300> it's<00:03:14.720> going<00:03:14.840> to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
half-and-half only because it's going to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
half-and-half only because it's going to
go<00:03:15.050> in<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.380> lasagna<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.220> want<00:03:16.460> it<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.610> be

go in the lasagna and I want it to be

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.470 
go in the lasagna and I want it to be
thicker<00:03:17.210> than<00:03:17.600> normal<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.360> won't

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
thicker than normal so so that it won't

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.350 
thicker than normal so so that it won't
run<00:03:20.720> out<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.960> the<00:03:21.170> lasagna<00:03:21.800> so<00:03:22.160> normally<00:03:23.000> i

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
run out of the lasagna so normally i

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.770 
run out of the lasagna so normally i
would<00:03:23.840> need<00:03:23.960> about<00:03:23.990> two<00:03:24.740> cups<00:03:25.160> of

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
half-and-half i'm going to use somewhat

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.100 
half-and-half i'm going to use somewhat
less<00:03:28.700> than<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.060> maybe<00:03:29.270> around<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.720> cup<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.050> a

less than that maybe around a cup and a
half<00:03:30.140> because<00:03:31.040> i<00:03:31.160> wanted<00:03:31.430> thicker<00:03:31.730> than

something to be and make changes

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.900 
something to be and make changes
accordingly<00:03:42.070> now<00:03:43.070> this<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.430> going<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.670> cook

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
accordingly now this is going to cook

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.190 
accordingly now this is going to cook
for<00:03:44.150> about<00:03:44.240> 10<00:03:45.130> maybe<00:03:46.130> 15<00:03:46.460> minutes<00:03:47.180> until<00:03:47.390> it

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
for about 10 maybe 15 minutes until it

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.870 
for about 10 maybe 15 minutes until it
really<00:03:48.560> thickens<00:03:48.980> up<00:03:49.130> then<00:03:49.490> we're<00:03:49.640> going<00:03:49.790> to

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
really thickens up then we're going to

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.600 
really thickens up then we're going to
cool<00:03:50.209> it<00:03:50.480> before<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.500> mix<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.040> with<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.310> ragatha

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610

cheese I've taken the bechamel out of

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.640 
cheese I've taken the bechamel out of
the<00:03:55.520> refrigerator<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.959> could<00:03:57.170> see<00:03:57.410> how

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the refrigerator and you could see how

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.890 
the refrigerator and you could see how
thick<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.700> has<00:03:58.880> gotten<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.510> that's<00:03:59.720> exactly

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
thick it has gotten and that's exactly

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.930 
thick it has gotten and that's exactly
what<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> want<00:04:00.770> because<00:04:00.890> again<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> don't<00:04:01.580> want

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.970 
it just oozing out of the lasagna which
it<00:04:05.360> would<00:04:05.450> do<00:04:05.600> if<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.870> was<00:04:05.959> too<00:04:06.170> thin<00:04:06.410> now<00:04:06.920> I'm

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980
