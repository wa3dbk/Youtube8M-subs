00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
need some points where he's checking

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.880 
need some points where he's checking
back<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> ball<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:37.559> points<00:00:37.800> where

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
yeah yeah yeah you know and I think

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670 
yeah yeah yeah you know and I think
we're<00:00:44.940> also<00:00:45.120> looking<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.600> an<00:00:45.719> evolution<00:00:46.320> with

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
we're also looking at an evolution with

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
we're also looking at an evolution with
with<00:00:46.980> number<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.850> players<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.329> position

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
with number of players in that position

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
with number of players in that position
that<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.500> evolution<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.070> our<00:00:50.190> system<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.670> think

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that the evolution of our system I think

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
that the evolution of our system I think
we'll<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.239> change<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.230> maybe<00:00:52.410> for

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
we'll have to change you know maybe for

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.330 
we'll have to change you know maybe for
a<00:00:52.710> 4<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.219> 22<00:00:53.460> @<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.910> 231<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
a 4 for 22 @ for 231 you know it just

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.939 
a 4 for 22 @ for 231 you know it just
gives<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.629> those<00:00:58.050> quality<00:00:58.680> players

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
gives you more of those quality players

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
gives you more of those quality players
on<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> field<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.820> time<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.289> that's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
on the field at one time so that's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
on the field at one time so that's
another<00:01:01.500> probably<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> consider<00:01:03.090> for

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
another probably thing to consider for

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.980 
another probably thing to consider for
for<00:01:03.989> Bob<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.939> natural<00:01:06.119> team<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
for Bob and and the natural team and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
for Bob and and the natural team and
we've<00:01:07.409> seen<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> from<00:01:07.979> Bob<00:01:08.220> Bob<00:01:08.520> tried<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
we've seen that from Bob Bob tried the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
we've seen that from Bob Bob tried the
for<00:01:09.299> 231<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> before<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
for 231 and before that it was a kind of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.480 
for 231 and before that it was a kind of
a<00:01:13.439> 451<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.990> only<00:01:16.439> problem<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> for

on<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:21.299> problem<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
on this but my problem with it over the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
on this but my problem with it over the
years<00:01:22.590> especially<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> American<00:01:23.820> team

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
years especially for the American team

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240 
years especially for the American team
when<00:01:24.210> our<00:01:24.420> our<00:01:24.900> positives<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:26.009> best

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
when our our positives our best

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
when our our positives our best
positives<00:01:27.119> are<00:01:27.330> our<00:01:27.570> speed<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> wing<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
positives are our speed on the wing in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.030 
positives are our speed on the wing in
our<00:01:28.710> lettuce<00:01:29.189> ISM<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.740> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> play<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
our lettuce ISM is that when you play a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
our lettuce ISM is that when you play a
423<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> shrinks<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> field<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
423 one it kind of shrinks the field a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.469 
423 one it kind of shrinks the field a
little<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> lot<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.159> people<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.329> have

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
little for a lot of people and you have

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.960 
little for a lot of people and you have
to<00:01:36.689> tend<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> play<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.740> centrally<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> more

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
to tend to play more centrally in more

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
to tend to play more centrally in more
down<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.869> middle<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> field<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.369> see

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
down the middle of the field you see

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
down the middle of the field you see
guys<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.360> che<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.200> mean<00:01:43.560> they're<00:01:43.680> never

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
guys like che there I mean they're never

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
guys like che there I mean they're never
on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.310> wings<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.820> always<00:01:45.000> checking<00:01:45.479> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
on the wings they're always checking in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
on the wings they're always checking in
and<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.649> they're<00:01:46.829> always<00:01:46.979> cutting<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and and they're always cutting in and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.600 
and and they're always cutting in and
pinching<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.409> maybe<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.920> my

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
pinching in and and so maybe that's my

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.410 
pinching in and and so maybe that's my
only<00:01:50.759> issue<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.180> playing<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.810> 231<00:01:53.390> yeah<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
only issue with playing for 231 yeah I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
only issue with playing for 231 yeah I
mean<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:56.070> point<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
mean it's a good point you know it's a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
mean it's a good point you know it's a
it's<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> personnel<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.310> how

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's really down to personnel and how

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.630 
it's really down to personnel and how
you<00:01:59.520> play<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.270> 231<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you play that for 231 because if you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
you play that for 231 because if you
look<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.750> ways<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> top

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
look at it in ways that some of the top

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
look at it in ways that some of the top
teams<00:02:05.009> do<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.880> almost<00:02:06.060> looks<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> 433

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
teams do it it almost looks like a 433

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.680 
teams do it it almost looks like a 433
at<00:02:07.409> times<00:02:07.640> with<00:02:08.640> two<00:02:08.819> wide<00:02:09.060> wingers<00:02:09.479> get

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
at times with two wide wingers get

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270 
at times with two wide wingers get
really<00:02:10.050> getting<00:02:10.319> forward<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.860> stretching

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
really getting forward and stretching

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.620 
really getting forward and stretching
the<00:02:11.400> back<00:02:11.550> line<00:02:11.849> when<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:13.080> have

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
the back line when you don't have

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.510 
the back line when you don't have
you<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> much<00:02:14.320> more<00:02:14.560> defensive<00:02:15.100> shape<00:02:15.280> and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
you have a much more defensive shape and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.350 
you have a much more defensive shape and
you<00:02:15.580> cut<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> field<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.450> said<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
you cut the field as you said in and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.300 
you cut the field as you said in and
make<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.570> much<00:02:19.840> smaller<00:02:20.110> field<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.830> that's<00:02:21.100> not

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
make a much smaller field and that's not

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.100 
make a much smaller field and that's not
what<00:02:21.640> you're<00:02:21.820> really<00:02:22.090> trying<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.690> with

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
what you're really trying to do with

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.360 
what you're really trying to do with
especially<00:02:23.710> when<00:02:23.830> you're<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> ball<00:02:24.340> you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
especially when you're on the ball you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.970 
especially when you're on the ball you
you<00:02:25.150> want<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.420> open<00:02:25.510> up<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.230> field<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
you want to open up the the field and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.850 
you want to open up the the field and
make<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.310> big<00:02:27.460> as<00:02:27.610> possible<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
make it as big as possible and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.830 
make it as big as possible and
conversely<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> defensive<00:02:31.180> side<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:31.630> a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
conversely on the defensive side so a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.100 
conversely on the defensive side so a
lot<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:33.160> 4231<00:02:33.850> does<00:02:34.390> really<00:02:34.660> depend<00:02:34.960> on

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
lot of that 4231 does really depend on

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.590 
lot of that 4231 does really depend on
those<00:02:35.230> outside<00:02:35.700> midfielders<00:02:36.700> know<00:02:37.060> sort<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.360> /

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
those outside midfielders know sort of /

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.890 
those outside midfielders know sort of /
lingers<00:02:38.580> yeah<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> mean<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.240> they<00:02:40.330> need<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.660> say

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
lingers yeah I mean and they need to say

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.810 
lingers yeah I mean and they need to say
i<00:02:40.930> widen<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.560> guess<00:02:41.770> my<00:02:41.980> issues<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.430> far<00:02:42.460> with

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
i widen I guess my issues so far with

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.900 
i widen I guess my issues so far with
Bob's<00:02:43.060> for<00:02:43.480> 231<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.350> 45<00:02:44.770> one<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.250> that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
Bob's for 231 and it's 45 one is that

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.450 
Bob's for 231 and it's 45 one is that
it's<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.930> massive<00:02:47.410> pinching<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:47.950> process

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
it's it's a massive pinching in process

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.730 
it's it's a massive pinching in process
from<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> winger's<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:50.020> can<00:02:50.200> never<00:02:50.440> really

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
from the winger's you can never really

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.120 
from the winger's you can never really
take<00:02:51.400> advantage<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.960> sudden<00:02:53.680> change<00:02:53.980> of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
take advantage of a a sudden change of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.810 
take advantage of a a sudden change of
field<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.440> make<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.190> make<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> run<00:02:57.670> down

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
field and and make it make a run down

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.370 
field and and make it make a run down
the<00:02:58.000> line<00:02:58.150> you're<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> have<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.080> rely<00:02:59.350> on

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the line you're going to have to rely on

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.630 
the line you're going to have to rely on
your<00:02:59.590> left<00:02:59.830> back<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.160> you're<00:03:00.250> right<00:03:00.370> back<00:03:00.430> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
your left back and you're right back to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.270 
your left back and you're right back to
do<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.300> when<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.600> happens<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:03.070> kind

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
do that and when that happens you kind

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.340 
do that and when that happens you kind
of<00:03:03.340> lose<00:03:03.520> lose<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.660> speed<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.290> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
of lose lose the the speed and the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.560 
of lose lose the the speed and the
athleticism<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.790> u.s.<00:03:07.000> can<00:03:07.180> bring<00:03:07.420> to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
athleticism that the u.s. can bring to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.070 
athleticism that the u.s. can bring to
to<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.080> field<00:03:08.760> yeah<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.090> if<00:03:10.990> you

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
to the field yeah and you know if you

to the field yeah and you know if you
look<00:03:11.260> at<00:03:11.380> guys<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.830> know<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.310> past<00:03:12.490> where

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
look at guys you know in the past where

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.120 
look at guys you know in the past where
guys<00:03:13.540> like<00:03:13.570> Toby<00:03:13.990> Jones<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.470> earning<00:03:14.740> Stewart

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
that that is a very difficult task and a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.240 
that that is a very difficult task and a
very<00:03:28.000> difficult<00:03:28.240> skill<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.960> you<00:03:29.680> know<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:29.830> I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
very difficult skill and you know you I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.530 
very difficult skill and you know you I
just<00:03:30.550> don't<00:03:30.730> see<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.060> for<00:03:31.270> some<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
just don't see that for some of the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.110 
just don't see that for some of the
players<00:03:31.750> what<00:03:32.050> we<00:03:32.140> have<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.790> has<00:03:33.970> to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
players what we have and and that has to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.060 
players what we have and and that has to
be<00:03:34.150> factored<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.960> into<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> system<00:03:35.950> of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
be factored in it into the system of

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.590 
be factored in it into the system of
course<00:03:36.280> because<00:03:36.610> when<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.850> do<00:03:37.000> have<00:03:37.150> guys<00:03:37.360> who

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
course because when you do have guys who

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.350 
course because when you do have guys who
like<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.410> pension<00:03:38.860> imagine<00:03:39.790> what<00:03:39.910> Salinas

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
like the pension imagine what Salinas

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.920 
like the pension imagine what Salinas
and<00:03:40.390> Shay<00:03:40.930> who<00:03:41.290> could<00:03:41.920> sometimes<00:03:42.430> comes

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and Shay who could sometimes comes

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and Shay who could sometimes comes
inside<00:03:43.930> because<00:03:44.380> they<00:03:44.530> feel<00:03:44.709> more

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
inside because they feel more

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.430 
inside because they feel more
comfortable<00:03:45.250> being<00:03:45.610> able<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:45.940> combine<00:03:46.440> it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
comfortable being able to combine it

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.230 
comfortable being able to combine it
does<00:03:47.680> take<00:03:47.950> something<00:03:48.640> away<00:03:48.760> from<00:03:48.940> your

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
does take something away from your

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.480 
does take something away from your
ability<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.900> stretch<00:03:50.110> teams<00:03:50.440> out<00:03:50.680> wide<00:03:50.920> yeah

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490

ability to stretch teams out wide yeah

aspects<00:05:33.170> I<00:05:34.720> really<00:05:35.720> did<00:05:35.840> enjoy<00:05:35.870> my<00:05:36.290> time<00:05:36.670> at

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
aspects I really did enjoy my time at

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.450 
aspects I really did enjoy my time at
Virginia<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.330> under<00:05:38.660> Bruce<00:05:38.900> was<00:05:39.770> learned

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
Virginia and under Bruce was learned

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.480 
Virginia and under Bruce was learned
quite<00:05:40.760> a<00:05:40.820> bit<00:05:40.940> obviously<00:05:41.980> from<00:05:42.980> Bruce<00:05:43.160> I<00:05:43.370> mean

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
quite a bit obviously from Bruce I mean

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.700 
quite a bit obviously from Bruce I mean
he's<00:05:43.670> I<00:05:43.700> think<00:05:44.030> one<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.990> top<00:05:45.200> coaches

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
he's I think one of the the top coaches

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.000 
he's I think one of the the top coaches
in<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.610> country<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:47.620> just<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.740> be<00:05:48.920> able

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
in in this country and just to be able

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.100 
in in this country and just to be able
to<00:05:49.220> be<00:05:49.340> around<00:05:49.580> him<00:05:49.790> in<00:05:49.970> that<00:05:50.150> capacity<00:05:50.360> was

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
to be around him in that capacity was

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.160 
to be around him in that capacity was
was<00:05:51.590> just<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:52.040> thrill<00:05:52.760> in<00:05:53.690> terms<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:54.020> going

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
was just a thrill in terms of going

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.440 
was just a thrill in terms of going
forward<00:05:54.320> you<00:05:55.010> know<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.700> never<00:05:55.730> say<00:05:56.090> never<00:05:56.330> to

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
forward you know you never say never to

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.930 
forward you know you never say never to
anything<00:05:56.570> I<00:05:56.900> think<00:05:57.800> with<00:05:58.670> the<00:05:58.790> right

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
anything I think with the right

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.570 
anything I think with the right
situation<00:05:59.570> I'd<00:05:59.630> love<00:05:59.810> to<00:05:59.930> look<00:06:00.110> at<00:06:00.260> a<00:06:00.830> coaching

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
situation I'd love to look at a coaching

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.780 
situation I'd love to look at a coaching
position<00:06:02.060> but<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:03.050> know<00:06:03.140> I<00:06:03.170> sort<00:06:03.950> of<00:06:04.010> got<00:06:04.700> a

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
position but you know I sort of got a

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.250 
position but you know I sort of got a
different<00:06:05.180> routing<00:06:05.360> more<00:06:05.690> into<00:06:05.900> management

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
different routing more into management

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.560 
different routing more into management
but<00:06:06.650> if<00:06:07.490> something<00:06:07.850> would<00:06:07.970> come<00:06:08.000> along<00:06:08.150> that

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
but if something would come along that

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.060 
but if something would come along that
makes<00:06:08.750> sense<00:06:08.960> of<00:06:09.140> course<00:06:09.380> I<00:06:09.530> would<00:06:09.920> certainly

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
makes sense of course I would certainly

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.390 
makes sense of course I would certainly
look<00:06:10.310> at<00:06:10.460> look<00:06:10.610> at<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.910> I<00:06:10.970> I<00:06:11.180> hold<00:06:11.840> a<00:06:12.080> licence<00:06:12.980> in
