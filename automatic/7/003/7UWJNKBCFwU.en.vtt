00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.160 
I've had some breakfast as you can see
from<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> plate<00:02:18.510> over<00:02:18.660> there

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
from the plate over there

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
from the plate over there
and<00:02:19.430> everything's<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.610> great<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.760> card

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and everything's going great the card

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
and everything's going great the card
isn't<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.660> loud<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.230> was<00:02:25.380> expecting

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
isn't as loud as I was expecting

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.780 
isn't as loud as I was expecting
and<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.850> can<00:02:27.030> feel<00:02:27.630> some<00:02:27.840> air<00:02:27.960> coming<00:02:28.260> out<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and I can feel some air coming out of it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.430 
and I can feel some air coming out of it
even<00:02:29.790> though<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.270> doesn't<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:30.930> rid<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.200> most

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
even though it doesn't get rid of most

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
even though it doesn't get rid of most
of<00:02:31.620> its<00:02:31.680> air<00:02:31.950> throughout<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:34.790> throughout<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
of its air throughout the throughout the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.100 
of its air throughout the throughout the
back<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.720> think<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:36.990> just

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
back I don't think I think it's just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.940 
back I don't think I think it's just
like<00:02:37.230> moves<00:02:38.100> off<00:02:38.340> into<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> case<00:02:38.970> mostly<00:02:39.950> so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
like moves off into the case mostly so

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.260 
like moves off into the case mostly so
it's<00:02:41.100> kind<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.400> good<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.730> I've<00:02:41.820> got<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> lot<00:02:42.240> of

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it's kind of good that I've got a lot of

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.130 
it's kind of good that I've got a lot of
exhaust<00:02:42.750> fans<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.010> setup<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.820> done<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.510> it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
exhaust fans so setup is done and it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.220 
exhaust fans so setup is done and it's
doing<00:02:46.560> its<00:02:46.740> final<00:02:47.220> restarts<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.910> believe<00:02:48.230> so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
doing its final restarts I believe so

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.800 
doing its final restarts I believe so
that's<00:02:49.380> looking<00:02:49.740> great<00:02:50.390> one<00:02:51.390> thing<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.780> I

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
that's looking great one thing that I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.410 
that's looking great one thing that I
dislike<00:02:52.460> here<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.520> can<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:53.790> setup<00:02:54.210> is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
dislike here you can see setup is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.570 
dislike here you can see setup is
preparing<00:02:54.960> your<00:02:55.170> computer<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.860> first<00:02:56.100> use

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
preparing your computer for first use

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.550 
preparing your computer for first use
one<00:02:57.510> thing<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.750> don't<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:57.990> about<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
one thing I don't like about this and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.260 
one thing I don't like about this and
I'm<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.770> sure<00:02:58.950> why<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.550> do<00:02:59.610> get<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.150> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
I'm not sure why is I do get a bit of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.740 
I'm not sure why is I do get a bit of
interference<00:03:00.570> from<00:03:01.340> both<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.850> drives<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.450> CD

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
interference from both the drives the CD

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.050 
interference from both the drives the CD

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
card driver I just needing get on to the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.770 
card driver I just needing get on to the
MSI<00:03:46.560> website<00:03:47.100> now<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.300> get<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> decent

graphics<00:03:49.110> card<00:03:49.500> driver<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:51.000> anyway<00:03:52.220> this

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
graphics card driver but anyway this

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.820 
graphics card driver but anyway this
took<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.550> while<00:03:53.700> last<00:03:54.000> time<00:03:54.270> so<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.650> think<00:03:55.650> it's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
took a while last time so I think it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.220 
took a while last time so I think it's
gonna<00:03:56.040> take<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> while<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.940> time<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:57.780> of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
very very easy and then probably a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.039 
very very easy and then probably a
restart<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.430> everything<00:04:21.269> should<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.630> going

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
restart and everything should be going
