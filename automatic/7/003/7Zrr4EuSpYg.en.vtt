Thomas I've been more comfortable I
think<00:02:58.970> also<00:02:59.180> one<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.750> reluctant<00:03:00.380> for

think also one is reluctant for

think also one is reluctant for
everybody<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.040> know<00:03:01.070> your<00:03:01.340> child<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.700> on

everybody to know your child is on

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.729 
everybody to know your child is on
medication<00:03:02.180> when<00:03:02.480> our<00:03:02.630> younger<00:03:03.080> because

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
medication when our younger because

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.710 
medication when our younger because
people<00:03:04.130> then<00:03:04.280> start<00:03:04.610> labeling<00:03:04.850> your<00:03:05.239> child's

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
people then start labeling your child's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.890 
people then start labeling your child's
so<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:06.230> often<00:03:06.770> say<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.070> parents<00:03:07.430> be<00:03:08.030> wise<00:03:08.299> talk

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
so I often say to parents be wise talk

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.449

distracted<00:03:35.040> by<00:03:35.370> small<00:03:36.060> things<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.630> there's

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
distracted by small things and there's

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.570 
distracted by small things and there's
quite<00:03:37.380> hard<00:03:37.560> trying<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:38.070> back<00:03:38.250> to

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
quite hard trying to get back to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.430 
quite hard trying to get back to
focusing<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.630> also<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:40.080> quite<00:03:40.260> difficult

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
focusing it's also like quite difficult

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.960 
focusing it's also like quite difficult
in<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.860> mornings<00:03:41.190> because<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.790> wake<00:03:41.910> up

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
in the mornings because if you wake up

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.790 
in the mornings because if you wake up
say<00:03:42.630> five<00:03:42.810> minutes<00:03:43.170> too<00:03:43.290> late<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.620> take

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
say five minutes too late and you take

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.830 
say five minutes too late and you take
your<00:03:43.950> medication<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.880> doesn't<00:03:45.240> we're<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.540> so

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
your medication it doesn't we're in so

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
your medication it doesn't we're in so
maybe<00:03:46.200> I'll<00:03:46.440> come<00:03:46.590> across<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> bit<00:03:47.220> hyper<00:03:47.400> act

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
maybe I'll come across a bit hyper act

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.530 
maybe I'll come across a bit hyper act
them<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.450> kind<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.810> challenge<00:03:50.540> having

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
them so it's kind of challenge having

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.200 
them so it's kind of challenge having
ADHD<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.680> gotta<00:03:52.890> remember<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.400> chill<00:03:53.610> brain

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
ADHD you gotta remember the chill brain

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.030 
ADHD you gotta remember the chill brain
is<00:03:54.390> wired<00:03:54.570> differently<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.230> others<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.830> I

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
is wired differently to others but I

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.790 
is wired differently to others but I
hate<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.400> when<00:03:56.430> people<00:03:56.730> brand<00:03:56.940> ADHD<00:03:57.420> as<00:03:57.900> being

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
hate it when people brand ADHD as being

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.440 
hate it when people brand ADHD as being
a<00:03:59.010> disorder<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.580> don't<00:03:59.790> think<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.180> disorder

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
a disorder I don't think it's a disorder

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.320 
a disorder I don't think it's a disorder
I<00:04:00.810> think<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.890> something<00:04:02.310> good<00:04:02.490> if<00:04:02.940> used

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
I think it's something good if used

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.360 
I think it's something good if used
properly<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.990> can<00:04:04.410> be<00:04:04.530> an<00:04:04.620> amazing<00:04:04.800> thing<00:04:05.160> like

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
properly it can be an amazing thing like

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.970 
properly it can be an amazing thing like
when<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.670> run<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.270> don't<00:04:06.720> run<00:04:07.140> out<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.290> energy<00:04:07.530> as

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
when I run I don't run out of energy as

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.400 
when I run I don't run out of energy as
quickly<00:04:08.520> as<00:04:08.700> some<00:04:08.850> people<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.300> i<00:04:09.330> can<00:04:09.600> run<00:04:10.170> much

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
quickly as some people so i can run much

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.830 
quickly as some people so i can run much
further<00:04:10.650> i<00:04:10.950> think<00:04:11.640> also<00:04:11.910> once<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.540> get<00:04:12.690> down

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
further i think also once you get down

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.450 
further i think also once you get down
to<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.110> working<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.800> concentrating<00:04:14.340> you

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
to the working and the concentrating you

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.100 
to the working and the concentrating you
can<00:04:14.610> work<00:04:14.820> for<00:04:15.060> longer<00:04:15.240> you<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.720> have<00:04:15.930> more

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
can work for longer you can have more

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.990 
can work for longer you can have more
concentration<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:17.430> I've<00:04:17.670> like<00:04:17.970> had

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
concentration because I've like had

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000 
concentration because I've like had
concentration<00:04:18.870> that's<00:04:19.080> like<00:04:19.350> straight

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
concentration that's like straight

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.560 
concentration that's like straight
frustration<00:04:20.610> for<00:04:20.700> three<00:04:20.880> or<00:04:20.970> four<00:04:21.030> hours<00:04:21.150> and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
frustration for three or four hours and

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.200 
frustration for three or four hours and
if<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:22.650> get<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.130> right<00:04:23.280> then<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.910> can<00:04:24.090> be

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
if you do get that right then it can be

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.550 
if you do get that right then it can be
something<00:04:24.420> that<00:04:24.600> will<00:04:24.810> make<00:04:24.870> your<00:04:25.170> life<00:04:25.320> even

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
something that will make your life even

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.600 
something that will make your life even
better<00:04:27.560> dr.<00:04:28.560> Dermot<00:04:28.830> in<00:04:28.950> his<00:04:29.040> approach<00:04:29.310> was

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
better dr. Dermot in his approach was

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.280 
better dr. Dermot in his approach was
actually<00:04:29.940> very<00:04:29.970> exciting<00:04:30.690> when<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.900> looked<00:04:31.170> it

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
actually very exciting when I looked it

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.870 
actually very exciting when I looked it
up<00:04:31.350> on<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.530> internet<00:04:32.010> there<00:04:32.370> have<00:04:32.550> been<00:04:32.760> in

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
up on the internet there have been in

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.420 
up on the internet there have been in
the<00:04:32.970> past<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.360> few<00:04:33.510> other<00:04:34.220> professionals<00:04:35.220> that

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
the past a few other professionals that

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.370 
the past a few other professionals that
have<00:04:35.490> mentioned<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.060> ADHD<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.930> strength

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
have mentioned that ADHD is a strength

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.920 
have mentioned that ADHD is a strength
and<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:38.760> think<00:04:38.970> we<00:04:39.060> need<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.300> change<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.630> way<00:04:39.810> we

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
and I think we need to change the way we

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.260 
and I think we need to change the way we
look<00:04:40.050> at<00:04:40.200> things<00:04:40.230> like<00:04:40.440> ADHD<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.370> certainly

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
look at things like ADHD and certainly

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.970 
look at things like ADHD and certainly
from<00:04:42.390> my<00:04:42.570> experience<00:04:43.110> with<00:04:43.230> Thomas<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.740> with

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
from my experience with Thomas and with

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.030 
from my experience with Thomas and with
other<00:04:44.160> ADHD<00:04:44.640> children<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.630> often<00:04:45.990> present<00:04:46.890> a

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
other ADHD children the often present a

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.740 
other ADHD children the often present a
perception<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.850> world<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.390> highly

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
perception of the world that is highly

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.920 
perception of the world that is highly
intelligent<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.820> not<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.300> deficit<00:04:51.810> but

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
intelligent and it is not a deficit but

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.510 
intelligent and it is not a deficit but
rather<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.320> is<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.470> strength<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:53.070> something

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
rather it is a strength and something

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.710 
rather it is a strength and something
positive<00:04:54.000> because<00:04:54.510> unfortunately

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
positive because unfortunately

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.690 
positive because unfortunately
everything<00:04:55.440> we<00:04:55.650> read<00:04:55.770> about<00:04:55.920> ADHD<00:04:56.310> is

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
everything we read about ADHD is

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.310 
everything we read about ADHD is
negative<00:04:57.180> because<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.600> whole<00:04:57.750> system<00:04:57.960> it's

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
negative because the whole system it's

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.390 
negative because the whole system it's
not<00:04:58.440> geared<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.830> ADHD<00:04:59.250> prison
