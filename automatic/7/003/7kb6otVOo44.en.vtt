00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello everyone today would like to share with 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.880
 you the first impressions of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.450
 This fablet that is a clone of samsung 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 galaxy alpha is about the mega flame with 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.369
 an ips hd screen of 6 with 3 inches 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 and a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.620
 It also has a 65 mtk processor 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.839
 92 with 8 cores to 1 with 7 gigahertz 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.930
 in terms of internal improvement, it has 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:42.550
 16 gigas and if we talk about ram memory 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.530
 then we find a gigabyte 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.600
 the terminal despite having a 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.610
 pretty big screen the truth is 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.710
 that is not uncomfortable at all 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.059
 to use it in addition a detail that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.579
 he liked it very much is that on the side 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.410
 left we can find the control 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.500
 of volume and on the right side we have 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.070
 the power button so it's done 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.290
 quite easy to handle then also 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.140
 it has a weight of 230 grams 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.960
 but you can see that it is quite 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.899
 fine which will facilitate us to take it 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.340
 in your pocket without bothering you too much 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.700
 at the top we can find 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.110
 the 35 mm minijack connector 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.060
 then as I said we have the button 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 on and at the bottom we have 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.909
 the micro usb connector 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.210
 then we also have control of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.210
 volume on the other side and already by the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.360
 front we find the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.119
 5 megapixel camera and then also 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.530
 has a light sensor and then 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.119
 has a led notifications 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.520
 simply for calls and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.289
 messages and in the back then we 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.159
 we found with a camera of 3 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.509
 megapixels accompanied by the led flash 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.220
 Now if we remove the lid we 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.549
 we will find a slot for a 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.319
 standard sim card a second slot 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.729
 for a micro sim card and then 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.789
 also a slot for a card 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.080
 micro sd up to 32 gigs plus 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.060
 we can see that it has a battery 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.369
 quite big not only in size but 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.619
 in capacity since 4200 has 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.500
 milliamps what will guarantee us 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.210
 enough autonomy for so 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.010
 least endure all day 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.720
 in terms of interface we can see that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.390
 has one very similar to those that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.460
 they bring the samsung galaxy series in 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.950
 this case you can see that the icons are 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.720
 they see quite small that's because 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.520
 I changed the dots per inch to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.620
 make better use of this screen 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.510
 terminal this change is really easy 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.070
 simply having root access and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.990
 using the city ​​app 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.920
 Changer we change the dots per inch 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.170
 to 320 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.880
 in this case I have chosen to use the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.440
 launcher nova launcher that we can 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.819
 install without any problem and we 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.489
 offer greater possibility of 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.080
 customization we can also see that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.550
 is completely fluid and other 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.680
 characteristics that I like is that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.330
 We can customize the menu 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.660
 applications to make the most of 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.950
 our large terminal screen a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.660
 detail that I did not like is that in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.300
 phone information puts version 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.970
 4.4 and this is not so has been modified 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.250
 on purpose since it has the version 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.769
 4.2 regarding the storage of 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.410
 16 gigas just one with all is 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.690
 destined to the phone memory this 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.310
 it's really scarce but you can 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.709
 resizing solve the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.140
 partitions with a little trick that we 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.760
 explain if you are interested other 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.739
 interesting aspect is that you get 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.420
 root access is really simple 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.610
 simply with this application form 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.560
 root we have to install it and run 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.690
 the last option and we will leave our 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.030
 Mobile rooteado if you're thinking 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.290
 install the module exposed 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.660
 unfortunately in this version it is not 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.000
 Possible installation as it does not count 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.890
 with a pure version of jandro 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.660
 now if we execute the one of santutxu 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.000
 we can see that the score is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.310
 quite high thanks in part to the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.680
 8-core processor we can also 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.090
 see in detail all the information of the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.870
 phone and we can check it again 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.630
 that the version is wrong is not 4.4 and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.280
 then this information is also not true 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.470
 on the resolution because it is not full hd 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.959
 is 1280 x 720 here below we can see 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.720
 also the dots per inch 240 that 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.609
 I changed them with the density changer and 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.549
 then here we actually see that the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.350
 version that includes is the 4.2 and in 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.060
 As for the sensors, we can see that 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.110
 it has the gravity sensor but it does 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.729
 which has the address 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.949
 acceleration light compass and proximity 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.379
 now if we run the chrome browser 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.319
 we can see that navigation is done 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.300
 quite smoothly and it's a 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.699
 authentic enjoy sailing with this 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.889
 so big screen we also see that the 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.259
 transitions are quite fluid and not 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.180
 there is no type of it when it comes to making 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.819
 zoom in the screens whether or not they are 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.900
 optimized for mobile the same happens to 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.939
 when to run the google maps 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.849
 we can see that the elevation is quite 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.830
 fluid and above all what surprised me 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.689
 was that the location of the gps was 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.099
 performed pretty fast even 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.099
 doing it from this 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.450
 if we do a test with youtube 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.730
 we can see that the experience continues 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.500
 being equally satisfactory in the 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.300
 denied denial and loading times 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.550
 they are quite short because there is a 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.710
 Attention is the quality that this 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.700
 screen despite having a price 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.700
 so reduced 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.350
 As for the games, the truth is 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.780
 that the experience has also been very 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.030
 satisfactory but the ones that I have tried in 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.860
 mobile is described quite well and by 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.230
 example in this case we are seeing the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.060
 nba jam which as the truth is not 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.010
 any kind of claim and the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.840
 graphics are in full resolution without 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.840
 no problem 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.479
 another example is the greeting which does not 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.470
 presented any kind of problems to the 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.570
 time to try it 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.850
 we can also see that there is no 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.330
 kind of and the graphics look at the 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.330
 perfection 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.830
 As for the battery we can see that 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.780
 is 67 percent after a 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.470
 hour and 40 minutes of having the screen 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.350
 lit 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.240
 so you can say that the mega flame 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.130
 it's a pretty interesting option for 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.440
 those who are looking for a mobile phone 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.330
 large dimensions plus the price is 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.010
 quite economical since you can 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.770
 find for about 180 dollars 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.450
 including shipping I have bought it in 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.430
 the page panda wheel dot com y os 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.260
 I'll leave the purchase link in the 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.670
 description of the video and good 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.560
 basically that's all if you liked it 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.390
