00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
all with every passing moment he

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.270

and<00:01:13.649> tubes<00:01:13.979> were<00:01:14.189> everywhere<00:01:14.929> and<00:01:15.929> then<00:01:16.109> he

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and tubes were everywhere and then he

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
and tubes were everywhere and then he
moved<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.890> closer<00:01:17.100> trying<00:01:17.789> not<00:01:18.060> to
