welcome back to the LEGO Club show hi
I'm<00:00:05.130> Josh<00:00:05.400> Wexler<00:00:05.940> I'm<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.540> producers

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
I'm Josh Wexler I'm one of the producers

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.259 
I'm Josh Wexler I'm one of the producers
of<00:00:07.020> Lego<00:00:07.410> Atlantis<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:08.849> here<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.120> tell

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
of Lego Atlantis and I'm here to tell

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.910 
of Lego Atlantis and I'm here to tell
you<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.599> bit<00:00:09.809> about<00:00:09.900> how<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.260> made<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
you a little bit about how we made the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.009 
you a little bit about how we made the
movie<00:00:11.190> one<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.300> questions<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.990> I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
movie one of the first questions that I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
movie one of the first questions that I
was<00:00:13.200> asked<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.280> make<00:00:14.490> Lego

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
was asked was how do we make Lego

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.050 
was asked was how do we make Lego
Atlantis<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> 3d<00:00:16.650> movie<00:00:16.830> well<00:00:17.820> oddly

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
Atlantis into a 3d movie well oddly

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.510 
Atlantis into a 3d movie well oddly
enough<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.600> actually<00:00:18.869> started<00:00:19.289> as<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.859> 2d<00:00:20.160> movie

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
enough we actually started as a 2d movie

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.250 
enough we actually started as a 2d movie
but<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.850> start<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> process<00:00:21.420> essentially

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
but we start the process essentially

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.960 
but we start the process essentially
with<00:00:22.439> designing<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> shots<00:00:23.460> look<00:00:23.609> like

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
with designing what the shots look like

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.050 
with designing what the shots look like
on<00:00:24.480> paper<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.170> artists<00:00:25.529> still<00:00:25.800> use<00:00:26.070> pencils

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
on paper so artists still use pencils

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.849 
on paper so artists still use pencils
and<00:00:27.269> crayons<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.840> markers<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.529> kind<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and crayons and markers to kind of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.290 
and crayons and markers to kind of
create<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.939> movie

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
create the look of the movie

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.970 
create the look of the movie
and<00:00:30.510> define<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.320> every<00:00:31.949> shot<00:00:32.279> looks<00:00:33.120> like

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
and define what every shot looks like

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
and define what every shot looks like
from<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:36.180> brought<00:00:36.480> into<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
from there it's brought into the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.740 
from there it's brought into the
computer<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.250> assets<00:00:38.910> are<00:00:39.120> modeled<00:00:39.629> as

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
computer and the assets are modeled as

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.830 
computer and the assets are modeled as
you<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.050> returning<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> 2d<00:00:41.190> geometry<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> we

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you see returning to 2d geometry and we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.900 
you see returning to 2d geometry and we
begin<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> animation<00:00:43.770> process<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> turn

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
begin the animation process but to turn

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.860 
begin the animation process but to turn
it<00:00:45.000> into<00:00:45.149> stereoscopic<00:00:46.110> 3d<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:47.070> actually<00:00:47.520> use

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
it into stereoscopic 3d we actually use

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.439 
it into stereoscopic 3d we actually use
two<00:00:48.870> virtual<00:00:49.860> cameras<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> computer<00:00:51.059> one

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
two virtual cameras in the computer one

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
two virtual cameras in the computer one
for<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> left<00:00:52.020> eye<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.160> right

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
for the left eye and one for the right

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.330 
for the left eye and one for the right
eye<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> essentially<00:00:54.329> mimic<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.770> way<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
eye to essentially mimic the way that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
eye to essentially mimic the way that
your<00:00:56.550> eyes<00:00:56.579> work<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.629> create<00:00:57.930> two<00:00:58.199> images

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
your eyes work and we create two images

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.479 
your eyes work and we create two images
that<00:00:59.390> look<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> scene<00:01:00.899> from<00:01:00.930> two<00:01:01.859> slightly

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that look at the scene from two slightly

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
that look at the scene from two slightly
different<00:01:02.850> angles<00:01:03.180> basically<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.019> when

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
different angles basically and when

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
different angles basically and when
those<00:01:04.290> two<00:01:04.559> scenes<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:05.159> sandwiched<00:01:06.060> together

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
those two scenes are sandwiched together

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.179 
those two scenes are sandwiched together
and<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.080> look<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.560> through<00:01:07.830> either

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and you look at them through either

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.179 
and you look at them through either
polarized<00:01:08.939> glasses<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> red<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.010> blue

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
polarized glasses or the red and blue

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
polarized glasses or the red and blue
anaglyph<00:01:11.880> glasses<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.869> on

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
anaglyph glasses like you might have on

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.359 
anaglyph glasses like you might have on
your<00:01:13.080> computer

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
your computer

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.149 
your computer
it<00:01:14.850> basically<00:01:15.000> tricks<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.930> brain<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it basically tricks your brain into the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
it basically tricks your brain into the
perception<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> creating<00:01:18.810> depth<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
perception of creating depth and that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980 
perception of creating depth and that
gives<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> 3d<00:01:20.640> effect<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.659> favorite

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
gives you the 3d effect my favorite

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
gives you the 3d effect my favorite
effect<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> film<00:01:22.619> definitely<00:01:22.860> has<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> be

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
effect on the film definitely has to be

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.010 
effect on the film definitely has to be
the<00:01:23.490> reveal<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> submarines<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the reveal of all the submarines that

the reveal of all the submarines that
our<00:01:25.200> heroes<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.710> built<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> ramp

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
our heroes just built and when the ramp

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
our heroes just built and when the ramp
opens<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> Neptune<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.290> all

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
opens up to the Neptune and they all

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.370 
opens up to the Neptune and they all
come<00:01:28.740> flying<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> big<00:01:30.720> 3d

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
come flying out you know we did a big 3d

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.550

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
submarines come out they literally come

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
submarines come out they literally come
right<00:01:39.479> off<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.960> screen<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.979> through

effect<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> show<00:01:45.140> I'd<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> say<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
effect on the show I'd have to say that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.260 
effect on the show I'd have to say that
the<00:01:46.979> most<00:01:47.130> challenging<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.939> movie

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the most challenging thing on this movie

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.429 
the most challenging thing on this movie
was<00:01:48.890> setting<00:01:49.890> almost<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> entire<00:01:50.640> picture

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
was setting almost the entire picture

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.760 
was setting almost the entire picture
underwater<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:53.850> had<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.329> figure<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.899> ways<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
underwater we had to figure out ways to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.319 
underwater we had to figure out ways to
create<00:01:56.570> computer-generated<00:01:58.009> underwater

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
create computer-generated underwater

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.280 
create computer-generated underwater
environment<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.659> only<00:02:00.719> looked<00:02:01.200> like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
environment that not only looked like

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
environment that not only looked like
our<00:02:01.740> characters<00:02:01.979> were<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> water<00:02:02.670> but

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
our characters were in the water but

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.990 
our characters were in the water but
also<00:02:03.180> sort<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.600> felt<00:02:03.840> true<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> lego

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
also sort of felt true to the lego

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.270 
also sort of felt true to the lego
Atlantis<00:02:06.000> world<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.320> ultimately

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
Atlantis world so we have to ultimately

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.360 
Atlantis world so we have to ultimately
give<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> sense<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.390> true<00:02:10.039> depth<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
give you a sense of true depth in that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.580 
give you a sense of true depth in that
these<00:02:11.610> guys<00:02:11.849> work<00:02:12.209> deeper<00:02:12.870> than<00:02:13.020> 35

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
these guys work deeper than 35

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559 
these guys work deeper than 35
and<00:02:13.739> feet<00:02:14.010> under<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> ocean<00:02:14.910> searching<00:02:15.420> for

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
and feet under the ocean searching for

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.449 
and feet under the ocean searching for
the<00:02:15.629> lost<00:02:15.810> city<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.080> Atlantis<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:17.069> did<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
the lost city of Atlantis we did that

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.770 
the lost city of Atlantis we did that
through<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> number<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.120> things<00:02:18.209> by<00:02:18.540> adding

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
through a number of things by adding

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.740 
through a number of things by adding
particles<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> water<00:02:19.890> by<00:02:20.510> slowing<00:02:21.510> down

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
particles in the water by slowing down

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.210 
particles in the water by slowing down
the<00:02:21.959> way<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> characters<00:02:22.590> actually<00:02:22.800> move

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the way the characters actually move

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.160 
the way the characters actually move
throughout<00:02:23.610> their<00:02:23.790> environment<00:02:24.420> through<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
throughout their environment through a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
throughout their environment through a
lot<00:02:25.349> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> bubble<00:02:25.860> effects<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.610> even

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
lot of the bubble effects and even

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.360 
lot of the bubble effects and even
things<00:02:27.780> they<00:02:27.870> say<00:02:28.110> there's<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.560> sound<00:02:28.890> design

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
things they say there's a sound design

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
things they say there's a sound design
they'll<00:02:29.790> give<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.060> clue<00:02:30.420> or<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> hints

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
they'll give you a clue or the hints

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.839 
they'll give you a clue or the hints
that<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.610> underwater

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
that your underwater

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.380 
that your underwater
really<00:02:33.629> helps<00:02:33.959> ultimately<00:02:34.680> sell<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:36.239> was

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
really helps ultimately sell it that was

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.729 
really helps ultimately sell it that was
probably<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> most<00:02:36.959> challenging<00:02:37.410> thing<00:02:37.470> that

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
probably the most challenging thing that

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.500 
probably the most challenging thing that
we<00:02:37.799> had<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.010> deal<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:40.970> can<00:02:41.970> honestly<00:02:42.150> say

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
we had to deal with I can honestly say

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.140 
we had to deal with I can honestly say
the<00:02:42.959> best<00:02:43.140> part<00:02:43.379> about<00:02:43.500> working<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.190> any<00:02:44.370> lego
