put out a couple videos talking about
the<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.809> know<00:00:09.900> comparing<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> speeds<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the you know comparing the speeds the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.150 
the you know comparing the speeds the
movement<00:00:11.550> speeds<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.030> flight<00:00:12.990> acro<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.830> super

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
movement speeds of flight acro and super

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.980 
movement speeds of flight acro and super
speed<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.179> thought<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.570> would<00:00:15.630> put<00:00:15.900> together

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
speed so I thought I would put together

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.050 
speed so I thought I would put together
because<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.560> mean<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:17.880> they<00:00:18.029> put

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
off from the same position okay and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
off from the same position okay and
we're<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:15.930> start<00:01:16.290> running<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we're gonna start running here in a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.270 
we're gonna start running here in a
second<00:01:17.280> alright<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.270> alright<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.280> go

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
second alright so we go alright so go

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
second alright so we go alright so go
down<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.270> orbit<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.900> he

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
down here now you know orbit you know he

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
down here now you know orbit you know he
was<00:01:22.229> he<00:01:22.380> kept<00:01:22.560> doing<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> double<00:01:23.369> jump<00:01:23.670> thing

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
was he kept doing the double jump thing

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.440 
was he kept doing the double jump thing
and<00:01:24.180> honestly<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.500> slows<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> down

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
and honestly I think that slows you down

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
and honestly I think that slows you down
when<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.220> that's<00:01:29.220> why<00:01:29.369> I'm

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
when you're doing it so that's why I'm

when you're doing it so that's why I'm
just<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> straight<00:01:30.479> surface

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
just you know on a straight surface

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
just you know on a straight surface
right<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.310> that's<00:01:32.310> why<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> picked<00:01:32.850> that's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
right here that's why I picked that's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.050 
right here that's why I picked that's
why<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> picked<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.720> bridge<00:01:34.790> just<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
why I picked this bridge just take it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.840 
why I picked this bridge just take it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
off straight down here alright coming up

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
off straight down here alright coming up
on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> last<00:01:39.299> pillar<00:01:39.600> coming<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
on the last pillar coming up on the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.140 
on the last pillar coming up on the
finish<00:01:40.619> line<00:01:40.860> boom<00:01:41.159> alright<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
finish line boom alright that is a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.899 
finish line boom alright that is a
twenty<00:01:42.600> three<00:01:42.810> point<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:43.320> seconds<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.729> right

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
twenty three point two seconds all right

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
twenty three point two seconds all right
before<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.420> cross<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> finish<00:01:46.079> line<00:01:46.229> right

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
before we cross that finish line right

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.749 
before we cross that finish line right
there<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.439> obviously<00:01:49.439> super<00:01:49.860> speed<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.340> faster

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
there so obviously super speed is faster

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.160 
there so obviously super speed is faster
