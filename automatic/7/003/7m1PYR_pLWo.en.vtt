00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello my dear friends, I hope you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.250
 be less happy and we are 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.140
 found today for a very video 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.220
 specialized nor why very very special 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.900
 because we end up for a video 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 where does he just want to show you in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 the bottom to break the episode 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.660
 number three and I'm just going to you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 show in the bottom of small 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.900
 sequences and friends that I realized 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.520
 that they are really funny actually I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.580
 I'm basically making a video of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.779
 epic kind trap in faction but that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 really went wrong because at 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.269
 final the big accounts instead of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.199
 understand that it's a joke he was coming 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.039
 destroy everything because he thought 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 that she had stuff in the base 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 but in the end there was nothing in the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
 good bump it's a bit of a pity by 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.250
 example I really enjoyed myself 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 change that my prison three years to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 build to think know how to do 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 because you know friends I am 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 a god of red stone finally good gold 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 meanwhile the ggyc in russia with 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.440
 three four sequences that guys get 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.489
 took part in my trap and you 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 go see him dying he's just 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.570
 obsessively stupid and funny and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.739
 it made me very happy not when I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
 say listen now just so I 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.980
 decided to make you it would not be the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.030
 better video machine but well 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 heard easing I would sincerely 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 that binds you that he shared because 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 it really was really cool to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 filming and then if you want more 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 end-of-the-line stuff like that but that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.840
 encourage me to hell to others because 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 it's really a good frame I would say 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
 sap it was almost for travel there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.439
