 you do not see anymore that was so 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.859
 hears a lot and I think so 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.500
 150 to 200 grams I'm not 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.979
 100 percent optional you can 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.229
 also sweet either with sugar or with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.049
 agave syrup i have one here now 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.939
 from a natura I gave thick juice 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.670
 I am not one hundred percent sure 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.040
 which it is but that is definitely 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.299
 something like sugar just like that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 I'm just liquid 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.070
 half teaspoon purely just with it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 it's a bit sweet myspace has 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.880
 in fact is fruits so I like 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.820
 can, for example, cut an apple and small 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 hewing or a banana I've got myself 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:46.259
 still in bern that is it at 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.119
 grapes or a few strawberries through 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.060
 Everything could be decided 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.740
 pure what you want so the next thing 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.640
 I do here I just do not like any 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.920
 pure and what the fruits are just fine 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.920
 and let it dry properly 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.490
 the next thing I do is easy 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.280
 The fruits are a bit small 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.000
 cut and easy in 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.520
 only good clean it is really nothing 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.940
 heavy and there you can see so the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.890
 I have apple and the banana now 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.040
 not taken so raspberry strawberry 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.750
 and grapes and make now so 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.380
 finished now you could just like that 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.150
 eat 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.069
 but I with a bit 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.069
 nutrient-rich have a few 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.260
 fiber has more in it and has 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.940
 a few more vitamins through the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.769
 Britannia couple of vitamins 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.709
 but we always really want a lot 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.920
 get out a lot and that's why I ever do 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.630
 So clean together you know so together 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.940
 something is from any such a thing 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.410
 funny plant I do not know 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.450
 I knew that I almost got it 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.819
 to forget 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.819
 blablabla you look like that looks like 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.690
 I'll show you what that looks like 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.190
 are just such a few seed looks 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.380
 a bit as if my garden 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.989
 So now it would mean going to the garden 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.010
 and then plug in something 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.010
 will focus now 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.850
 I can see yes just looks like that 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.360
 a bit like poppy 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:40.350
 or like black and 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.970
 normal sesame stop and talk about it 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.440
 just a little something on it a 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.370
 about a tablespoon one to watch 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.380
 a little less than half 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.630
 tablespoon and that's really enough 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.910
 so sorry for the information that was 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.290
 everything right but to the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.460
 At the moment, I'm not so 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.480
 correctly informed so the animal names 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.790
 come from a plant so on 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.740
 German as the ornamental plant 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.630
 so to speak and now quite a whole 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.730

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.140
 googling so have thrifty many 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.810

 All the stuff I'm doing right now 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.660
 counted like other foods 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.520
 and that's why they're so good when 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.470
 you tried that you can not 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.890
