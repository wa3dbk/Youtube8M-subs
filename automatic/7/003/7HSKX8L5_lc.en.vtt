hi in this video we'll learn about basic

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.810 
hi in this video we'll learn about basic
concepts<00:00:10.840> of<00:00:10.959> 2d<00:00:11.230> animation<00:00:11.830> the<00:00:12.160> simple<00:00:12.610> bar

boxing if you are beginner and if you
want<00:00:15.699> to<00:00:15.850> know<00:00:16.000> what<00:00:16.270> is<00:00:16.420> truly<00:00:16.690> a<00:00:16.720> commission

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
want to know what is truly a commission

want to know what is truly a commission
watch<00:00:18.220> this<00:00:18.460> video<00:00:18.760> first<00:00:19.660> see<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.520> is<00:00:21.670> very

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
watch this video first see this is very

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.560 
watch this video first see this is very
very<00:00:22.449> simple<00:00:22.869> bar<00:00:23.230> bouncing<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:25.210> is<00:00:25.359> what

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
very simple bar bouncing this is what

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.529 
very simple bar bouncing this is what
just<00:00:26.230> I<00:00:26.349> mean<00:00:26.560> so<00:00:26.829> I'll<00:00:27.519> explain<00:00:27.789> what<00:00:28.179> is<00:00:28.300> 2d

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
just I mean so I'll explain what is 2d

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.079 
just I mean so I'll explain what is 2d
animation<00:00:28.990> with<00:00:29.169> this<00:00:29.320> example<00:00:29.970> animation<00:00:30.970> is

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
animation with this example animation is

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.860 
animation with this example animation is
actually<00:00:31.800> playing<00:00:32.800> a<00:00:33.010> sequence<00:00:33.430> of<00:00:33.610> drawings

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
actually playing a sequence of drawings

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.540 
actually playing a sequence of drawings
actually<00:00:34.870> this<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.290> one<00:00:35.470> frame<00:00:35.770> this<00:00:36.220> is<00:00:36.340> one

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
actually this is one frame this is one

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.729 
actually this is one frame this is one
for<00:00:36.760> this<00:00:37.180> their<00:00:37.540> own<00:00:37.780> frames<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.930> when<00:00:41.620> we

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
for this their own frames but when we

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.810 
for this their own frames but when we
play<00:00:42.899> certain<00:00:43.899> speed<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.340> will<00:00:45.460> see<00:00:45.670> the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
play certain speed you will see the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.049 
play certain speed you will see the
moment<00:00:46.180> that<00:00:46.809> is<00:00:46.899> because<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.910> persistence<00:00:48.910> of

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
moment that is because of persistence of

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.049 
moment that is because of persistence of
vision<00:00:49.199> means<00:00:50.199> if<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:50.980> see<00:00:51.190> one<00:00:51.429> frame<00:00:51.760> it

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
vision means if you see one frame it

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.419 
vision means if you see one frame it
won't<00:00:52.449> go<00:00:52.809> friend<00:00:53.109> one<00:00:53.289> mind<00:00:53.500> immediately<00:00:53.800> it

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
won't go friend one mind immediately it

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.229 
won't go friend one mind immediately it
stares<00:00:54.789> in<00:00:55.090> your<00:00:55.300> mind<00:00:55.660> for<00:00:56.019> a<00:00:56.079> few<00:00:56.890> more

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
stares in your mind for a few more

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.119 
stares in your mind for a few more

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
fraction of seconds by the time next

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.040 
fraction of seconds by the time next
frame<00:01:00.339> comes<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.089> that<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.329> will<00:01:01.449> see<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.870> like

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
frame comes so that you will see it like

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.580 
frame comes so that you will see it like
a<00:01:02.160> moment<00:01:03.269> see<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:05.080> are<00:01:05.199> seeing<00:01:05.410> actually

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
a moment see you are seeing actually

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.610 
a moment see you are seeing actually
series<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.580> frames<00:01:06.910> because<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:08.500> are

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
series of frames because you are

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.219 
series of frames because you are
remembering<00:01:09.040> those<00:01:09.280> frames<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:10.990> called

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
remembering those frames that is called

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.460 
remembering those frames that is called
persistence<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.400> vision<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:13.960> one<00:01:14.229> la

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
persistence of vision there is one la

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
principle persistence of vision because

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.410 
principle persistence of vision because
of<00:01:17.439> that<00:01:17.799> you<00:01:18.100> are<00:01:18.220> actually<00:01:18.400> seeing<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
of that you are actually seeing the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.200 
of that you are actually seeing the
movement<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:20.979> reality<00:01:21.189> we<00:01:21.700> are<00:01:21.729> drawing

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
movement but in reality we are drawing

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.319

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
ninth tenth eleventh and twelfth like

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.030 
ninth tenth eleventh and twelfth like
this<00:01:30.700> I've<00:01:30.939> drawn<00:01:31.360> twelve<00:01:31.720> frames<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.409> when

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
this I've drawn twelve frames and when

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.469 
this I've drawn twelve frames and when
you<00:01:33.159> are<00:01:33.250> playing<00:01:33.369> with<00:01:33.700> something<00:01:34.030> speed

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you are playing with something speed

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.749 
you are playing with something speed
that<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.659> continuous<00:01:38.500> movement<00:01:38.799> but<00:01:39.009> if<00:01:39.549> I

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
that is a continuous movement but if I

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.840 
that is a continuous movement but if I
click<00:01:40.390> see<00:01:41.110> you're<00:01:41.350> seeing<00:01:41.619> actually<00:01:42.070> like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
click see you're seeing actually like

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.319 
click see you're seeing actually like
movement<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.600> clicking<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.140> frames<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:46.090> is

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
movement and clicking the frames this is

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.539 
movement and clicking the frames this is
the<00:01:46.600> fundamental<00:01:47.320> concept<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.920> animation

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
the fundamental concept of animation

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.230 
the fundamental concept of animation
that<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.719> reason<00:01:49.869> everybody<00:01:50.820> tell<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.939> to

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
that is the reason everybody tell you to

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880 
that is the reason everybody tell you to
first<00:01:52.479> level<00:01:52.659> try<00:01:53.079> on<00:01:53.140> something<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:53.829> that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
first level try on something like that

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
first level try on something like that
say<00:01:55.079> 2d<00:01:56.079> animation<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.670> series<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.820> drawings

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
say 2d animation is a series of drawings

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.819 
say 2d animation is a series of drawings
displayed<00:01:59.530> at<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.039> certain<00:02:00.460> speed<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:02.680> is

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
displayed at a certain speed what is

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.760 
displayed at a certain speed what is
animation<00:02:03.430> animation<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.479> display<00:02:05.439> a

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
animation animation is a display a

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.180 
animation animation is a display a
sequence<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.640> images<00:02:06.939> with<00:02:07.630> certain<00:02:07.990> speed<00:02:08.350> so

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
sequence of images with certain speed so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
sequence of images with certain speed so
that<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.640> will<00:02:09.970> see<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.420> moment<00:02:11.170> because<00:02:11.950> of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
that you will see the moment because of

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.490 
that you will see the moment because of
persistence<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.880> vision

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.980 

you<00:02:18.160> need<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.490> be<00:02:18.580> good<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.880> drawing<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.810> he

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
you need to be good in drawing and he

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.900 
you need to be good in drawing and he
need<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.350> be<00:02:20.470> good<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.800> understanding<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
need to be good in understanding the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.940 
need to be good in understanding the
moment<00:02:22.300> these<00:02:22.660> are<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.990> two<00:02:23.200> things<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.770> you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
moment these are the two things if you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.280 
moment these are the two things if you
want<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:24.400> good<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.880> reanimation<00:02:25.510> one
