00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
 what reflections do we need to refine 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.070
 our vehicle 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.620
 they realize we need a filter of 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.260
 gasoline can be made of metal plastic 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.680
 it does not matter we have our filter 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.660
 air and our four spark plugs this car 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
 originally you need spark plugs of three 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 electrodes if it's a very cold spark plug 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.349
 original equipment is energetic in this case 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.020
 I'm putting the spark plug with range 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.690
 thermal 8 that is a pretty cold 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.879
 since the client requested a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.090
 cheap companies did not want to buy the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.010
 of 3 ElectrobrÃ¡s of 3 electors lasts more 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.379
 of flavor and thus a colder evolution 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.960
 because we have a central electrode and then 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.120
 three electrodes the whole spark is 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.370
 jumping to where it's going to jump to where 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.839
 is closer if it is going to be 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.570
 jumping from it is closer 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.670
 two strategies of an original electrode 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.720
 must carry three electrodes equipment 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.930
 originals on it 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.930
 let's see now our tool 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930
 required 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.190
 our spark plug die with the extension 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.470
 the rattle 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.050
 what is our adapter for the buoy 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.050
 a screwdriver 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.500
 our murias calibrator 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.360
 I use this screwdriver which is 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.539
 which I always use is a screwdriver 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.710
 wide nothing else I put a cap for 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.710
 be able to remove the spark plugs 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.789
 our multimeter to check the 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.789
 spark plug wires 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.430
 time lamp 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.500
 and our buoy 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.190
 to put the liquid readings 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.140
 by pressure 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.140
 by means of a compressor
