00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.480
 the Silent to the fans to come a victory against the rival from Ingolstadt 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.880
 staggeringly 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.809
 for the keeper 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.869
 Everything is great, of course 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.859
 he is always the source of power he thinks the road 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:14.979
 4 percent 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.769
 but he was a little lower second 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.429
 it not only has two throttling processes during the westbound process 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.710
 Underpaid for that very much 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.740
 the belief is there you have to look that you want to know that everyone will see that 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.509
 you EPO right 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.889
 The decision fell in the final minute three to two for the ICE 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:33.560
 Tigers from Nuremberg 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.560
 Bottrop to Brad Leeb 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.220
 that makes a lot 2 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.120
 and we become a match winner 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 His third goal 50 seconds before the end 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
 his fourth goal of the season this evening 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.380
 CC net the defender probably no longer with the last use 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 Christoph Breuer at 3 03 percent 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 Ralph Solveen he is 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 internal memory in the sometimes very strong quarter and a good time 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.730
 we play together for some time it works we do not do anything special 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.090
 But things are coming to an end now almost everything 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.659
 the statements are thanks to Heaven RWE according to Winterkorn 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.120
 two shots on the goal because of Nuremberg there was not more in the first 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.050
 Wiss became ninth minute then Barrick Cen's pass 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.940
 on return 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 that was the 1 0 Fariñas carrier 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 27 out of 30 shots 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.190
 their been 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.270
 but Brett Leeb is known for that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 that deducts SAP directly 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 in this case from the blue line 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.970
 almost a little gymnastics good 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.130
 for the neck 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.130
 especially popular after all the scarcest 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.920
 both teams equally strong in the first third the sda ​​Andreas Brockmann and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.080
 also the guest trainer I heard that works have very good ice hockey 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.309
 Not only the first round of the Plauer brought 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.089
 except this one conceding I just pretend soft- or let under 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:23.119
 unsure to rough 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.679
 in the second third 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.819
 played one minute then fits Wichert Müller to Bornheim and it is 1 2 1 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.209
 63 seconds played 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.209
 Greg Thomsen satisfied now 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.899
 Fathi back problems now he helps 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.959
 Skorer point for the newcomer Richert Müller after the retirement of Thomas 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 Greilinger committed 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.809
 a little later Mose Ingoldstadt outnumbered another deferred 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:56.509
 accept 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:01.569
 Shorty gets her 2 minutes because of Hook's referee 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.299
 exactly 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.709
 27 seconds to have over profile 5 against 3 Howard Millar is 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.529
 Haider 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:16.349
 Jeff Likens and Wieland Orden Fox the shell neither shot blow of like ins 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.849
 then the child is no longer blocked 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.329
 the last few seconds 5 against 3 it now feels like being on the ice again 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.349
 Nuremberg met-chem von like Enz at the blue line 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.669
 a shot No No Posco make two to one of the opening goals after one 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.889
 twentieth 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.239
 second hit 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.929
 in this game for Libya 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.109
 because expander 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.859
 just when the opponent was at least three seconds at least 40 again 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.380
 fight your shot 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.980
 but suits powered up powerplay gates to guide the ICE Fighters 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.529
 not over numbers as Ingolstadt SBO Brandt 2 minutes due to deporting 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.769
 gets back to August the ICE day for powerplay 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.739
 but this time they drive a counter 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.999
 more cash has the odds outnumbered Patrick Ehelechner seconds 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.489
 later a play error on the defensive and what a 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.880
 beneficiary 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.350
 this is Frederik Henriksen 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.560
 Mildner Czerny slap shot for 3 2 1 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.110
 second partner hit within two minutes that was the sticking point of the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 game 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.639
 on the e3 against statement 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.270
 Euro so far he could riots Borussia Dortmund for the episode 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.630
 to decide on the same shortfall two deaths 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:42.939
 to have 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.929
 It almost seems like the goalie has been dodging the skin 

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:48.360
 ourselves 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.740
 no classic powerplay goal 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.909
 from the guests mistakes 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.729
 Wahlexperten everything clear

 second itself district Zofingen awp present Obernburg undeterred the fourth 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:00.699
 Gate old town 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.650
 this is one for our 13th 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.650
 the supplier of the countries and the but it continues 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.020
 Ingolstadt seemed to be out of the game 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.090
 but the Panthers should know there two minutes later 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:14.479
 Bradley 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.639
 without a stick 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.300
 the team wm lives 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300
 with the connecting goal to the 2 2 3 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.879
 the last one and she's the one who is Tim Hambly 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.360
 he does not aim blindly but waits for the gap to find 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.259
 his first goal of the season 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.259
 Italia brings the Panthers back into play 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.920
 London dpa Birgit train to the 3 1 round 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.730
 op Dortmund 3 1 Piano Roma Staff could have shown the players lying 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.640
 we always have four five high hundred percent chances head 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.510
 not found here is Dedenborn and then sometime it has to come 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.420
 because what the 3 2 shot there one has even been a box 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.419
 Seconds before the final siren in the second section 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.129
 former Kurt Müller 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.809
 Tyler Bouck wonderfully served he has the compensation on the racket 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.599
 after two thirds that was an open game in this Bavarian 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.110
 Lust on the ice itself will unfold to team order 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.599
 we have not been so defensive that Frederik b 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.740
 However, one should have stood up for his role in business though 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.380
 he is in the last quarter but then again the old master 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.360
 that hurts a bit he Cerberus are two more categories 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.189
 Goals against 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.719
 conversely, the world would have told 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.999
 By being proud of the scenery, it is there that the threesome is 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.889
 it is at the same time the 3 2 by Oster da Silva racist FC Chelsea on the out 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.629
 but it is true that it is the second final on 11 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:57.719
 Drivers how important the us actor is the suffering of the victims 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.720
 The last third played Nuremberg into the goal of a top team almost 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.719
 flawless this time no chance anymore 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.690
 the exception 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.669
 this shot of Colin Forbes 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.439
 but Patrick Ehelechner is on hand 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:16.439
 no room for the Panthers 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.500
 after the 14 2 in the empty goal, the fans counted in peace, the last seconds down 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.620
 then the rival from Ingolstadt was defeated for the second time this season 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:45.399
 the front-runner therefore remains at the top of the table 

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:48.479
 Winners have reason to shine and yet 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.979
 he is in the long run to assess is currently rather "out" 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:56.080
 Florian Heller empty 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.960
 lrs 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.249
 Jaffar made a few games though 

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:01.539
 nevertheless it is nice to lose sight 

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:04.539
 Daum is now playing education percent 

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:08.900
 certainly not always presented because hearing is higher when one reaches 52 4 

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:10.099
 Points 

00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:12.249
 after winning derby victory 

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:15.249
 everybody wanted to party in a childlike way 

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:17.239
 something like that
