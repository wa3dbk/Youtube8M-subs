bag very nice I like it but you know

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.380 
bag very nice I like it but you know
it's<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.680> bag<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.159> if<00:01:49.670> we<00:01:49.880> look<00:01:50.120> closer

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
it's just a bag and if we look closer

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.300 
it's just a bag and if we look closer
you're<00:01:50.810> gonna<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.170> see<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.860> leveler

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
you're gonna actually see the leveler

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.110 
you're gonna actually see the leveler
that<00:01:52.760> comes<00:01:53.060> on<00:01:53.300> top<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.400> DSLR<00:01:55.400> slider<00:01:55.790> and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
that comes on top of the DSLR slider and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.030 
that comes on top of the DSLR slider and
I<00:01:56.659> think<00:01:56.960> that's<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.260> very<00:01:57.440> neat<00:01:57.710> feature

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
I think that's a very neat feature

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.310 
I think that's a very neat feature
especially<00:01:58.729> for<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.420> hundred<00:01:59.780> dollar<00:01:59.960> price

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
especially for the hundred dollar price

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.990 
especially for the hundred dollar price
range<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:01.479> simple<00:02:02.479> knob<00:02:03.409> which<00:02:03.950> uses<00:02:04.760> to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
range this simple knob which uses to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.100 
range this simple knob which uses to
tighten<00:02:05.510> or<00:02:05.840> loosen<00:02:05.870> up<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.040> that<00:02:07.190> way<00:02:07.370> you<00:02:07.430> can

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
tighten or loosen up so that way you can

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.220 
tighten or loosen up so that way you can
move<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.440> slider<00:02:10.239> from<00:02:11.239> left<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.720> right<00:02:11.989> right

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
move the slider from left to right right

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.870 
move the slider from left to right right
to<00:02:12.290> left<00:02:12.470> whichever<00:02:13.130> one<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.489> want

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
to left whichever one you want

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.080 
to left whichever one you want
it<00:02:14.200> works<00:02:15.200> two<00:02:15.590> ways<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:16.070> actually<00:02:16.220> was<00:02:16.700> holding

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it works two ways I actually was holding

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.380 
it works two ways I actually was holding
it<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.709> using<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.130> way<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:19.640> we<00:02:20.060> turn<00:02:20.239> it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
it and using it that way if we turn it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.890 
it and using it that way if we turn it
around<00:02:20.450> you're<00:02:20.750> gonna<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:22.209> 1/4<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.420> 3/8

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
around you're gonna see the 1/4 and 3/8

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.060 
around you're gonna see the 1/4 and 3/8
screw<00:02:24.440> who<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.580> complete<00:02:25.910> your<00:02:26.620> tripod<00:02:27.620> on
