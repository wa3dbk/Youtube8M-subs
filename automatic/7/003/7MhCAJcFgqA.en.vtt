hello everyone today I'm here with this
little<00:00:03.780> thing<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.589> excited<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.040> open<00:00:05.160> it

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
little thing and I'm excited to open it

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.880 
little thing and I'm excited to open it
because<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:06.150> have<00:00:06.720> no<00:00:06.870> idea<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.379> book<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.680> is

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
because I have no idea what book this is

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:17.689 
because I have no idea what book this is
I<00:00:15.500> can't<00:00:16.500> exactly<00:00:16.770> remember<00:00:16.980> how<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> came

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I can't exactly remember how I came

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.910 
I can't exactly remember how I came
across<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.420> whole<00:00:18.630> thing<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.380> little

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
across this whole thing but a little

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
across this whole thing but a little
while<00:00:20.039> ago<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.640> learnt<00:00:21.090> about<00:00:21.210> these<00:00:21.600> things

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
while ago I learnt about these things

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
while ago I learnt about these things
called<00:00:22.289> blind<00:00:22.710> dates<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> book<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
called blind dates with the book and I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
called blind dates with the book and I
think<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.600> case<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> finding<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
think this is just a case of finding a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
think this is just a case of finding a
bookstore<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.400> does<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:27.599> do

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
bookstore that does it but what they do

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.410 
bookstore that does it but what they do
is<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.650> wrap<00:00:28.949> up<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.250> book<00:00:29.609> usually<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.269> just

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
is they wrap up a book usually and just

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.030 
is they wrap up a book usually and just
like<00:00:30.539> brown<00:00:30.750> paper<00:00:30.960> something<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
like brown paper something like this and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.340 
like brown paper something like this and
on<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.430> front<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:33.300> will<00:00:33.450> write<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.840> few<00:00:34.140> key

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
on the front they will write a few key

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
on the front they will write a few key
words<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.340> describe<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> book<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.780> little

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
words that describe the book a little

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
words that describe the book a little
bit<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.500> doesn't<00:00:37.770> give<00:00:37.890> too<00:00:38.100> much<00:00:38.250> away

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
bit but it doesn't give too much away

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
bit but it doesn't give too much away
and<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.870> fun<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and I think this is a really fun and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
and I think this is a really fun and
exciting<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> discover<00:00:42.210> new<00:00:42.329> books

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
exciting way to discover new books

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.299 
exciting way to discover new books
probably<00:00:43.230> books<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.829> wouldn't<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.129> picked

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
probably books you wouldn't have picked

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
probably books you wouldn't have picked
up<00:00:44.520> before<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.210> there's<00:00:45.629> definitely<00:00:45.719> no<00:00:46.020> case

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
up before and there's definitely no case

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
up before and there's definitely no case
of<00:00:46.410> judging<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> book<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.579> cover<00:00:47.640> here

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of judging a book by it's cover here

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
of judging a book by it's cover here
because<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.629> no<00:00:48.780> freaking<00:00:49.230> clue<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because I have no freaking clue what the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
because I have no freaking clue what the
cover<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.550> or<00:00:50.760> anything<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
cover is or anything like that so I

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
cover is or anything like that so I
thought<00:00:52.050> I'd<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.410> open<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:52.890> today<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
thought I'd just open this up today and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
thought I'd just open this up today and
see<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:53.730> book<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.219> let's<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:58.289> it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
I don't think I've ever heard of this
book<00:01:08.010> before<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:08.610> very<00:01:08.850> intrigued<00:01:09.270> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
book before but I'm very intrigued it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
book before but I'm very intrigued it's
about<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> man<00:01:10.260> named<00:01:10.680> Bruce<00:01:10.979> Curry<00:01:11.369> he<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
about a man named Bruce Curry he is the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
about a man named Bruce Curry he is the
leader<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.510> mercenary<00:01:12.869> band<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.470> Africa

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
leader of a mercenary band in Africa

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
leader of a mercenary band in Africa
where<00:01:14.610> their<00:01:15.030> mission<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.840> relieve<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

mining town which is besieged by rebels

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
mining town which is besieged by rebels
I<00:01:19.200> believe<00:01:19.590> he's<00:01:19.710> also<00:01:19.950> supposed<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> collect

I believe he's also supposed to collect
a<00:01:20.850> consignment<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.330> diamonds<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.080> yeah<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
a consignment of diamonds and yeah it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
a consignment of diamonds and yeah it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
sounds quite interesting there are
