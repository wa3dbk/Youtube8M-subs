00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:10.679
 video today I want to talk to you about this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.929
 product is the comet of the omer era from 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.000
 so much so that I made a video 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.949
 review or otherwise I was talking about 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.220
 equipment in general however as it is 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.990
 I often know that too many times 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.730
 people ask me about it 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 any type of force equipment 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.740
 friends I start again to make videos of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.740
 this type 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 as for the previous video reviews 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.619
 talked about the positive aspects e 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.540
 negatives of this torch and of course 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.460
 we will talk about the materials costs of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 how do of how it works of what i do 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 like what I don't like but let's move on 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.860
 in detail then this is the whole 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 its totality 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
 the torch is composed of materials 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.090
 however quite acceptable with a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.030
 good rubber grip here in the side 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.699
 plastic and aluminum ferrule with badger 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.210
 plastic and strap for ours 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.460
 rubber wrist the torch is disassembled in the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:07.830
 following this way , the first ring is trusted 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.799
 the second plastic ring is unscrewed e 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 then the led body comes out 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.740
 they begin immediately with the aspects 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 negative of this torch is why 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.580
 I think certain things could be 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 better then we start immediately with 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.619
 say that these two components 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.390
 I think it should be united in the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.670
 sense that this was supposed to be a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.250
 one thing with the plastic ring thing 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 it happened to me after a couple of catches 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.060
 they are no longer able to unscrew this 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.340
 plastic rings because it was 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.399
 totally tightened to the torch body 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.320
 I then risked to break it because I have 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.179
 had to force so much to open it e 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.240
 replace the batteries other aspect 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.819
 negative is made of plastic that yes 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.159
 almost easily scratches in my opinion 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.490
 should at least be implemented 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.799
 glass other negative aspect goes direct 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.250
 and mica some dinner I'm objectively 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.350
 speaking of this of this torch 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.350
 another negative aspect I think enough 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.769
 subjective is that from the first moment 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.720
 online is in the instruction booklets la 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.079
 thigh lights both in this way 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.670
 that in this way comes to me 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.160
 only in this way 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.410
 in short, the power button works 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.879
 in two ways but my thing works 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.500
 however only in one sense however 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.810
 it works and so but the tango 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.970
 inside the torch we can 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.920
 insert four AA type batteries 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.690
 1.5 volts 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.489
 obviously they are not provided in the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.519
 pack the light beam has 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.739
 an intensity of 340 lumens and ha 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.500
 an autonomy of 5 hours of continuous light e 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.930
 15 hours of intermittent light 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.459
 last negative aspect if so yes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.190
 can say then we leave immediately with the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.319
 positive aspects is that the light beam 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.090
 is too concentrated in the center 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.579
 it is difficult for me when the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.769
 luminol age nor illuminate the dens with 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.739
 reflective light I have to force 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.139
 project the beam throughout the den e 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.180
 this gave me not a little trouble though 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.419
 however the light is good is enough 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.169
 strong and is within acceptable quotation marks 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:17.000
 positives suffered the cost has 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:19.519
 good value for money with 40 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.069
 euro euro plus euro less we manage to 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.859
 buy a pretty led flashlight 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.400
 performance even if yes with some 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:30.180
 problem, however, 40 euros for a torch a 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 I think LEDs are 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.790
 good piece another negative aspect is 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.650
 light enough it is easy to hold 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.640
 and turns on easily with a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.739
 very minimal effort the very last thing 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.569
 that I had forgotten the fact that I didn't 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.000
 has a return key after 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.040
 the ignition an automatic return to the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.739
 off meant that often 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.540
 gladly but she forgot it turned on 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.120
 however ultimately it is a product that 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.609
 according to me it can be purchased with 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.980
 all tranquility after you are 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.989
 certain things 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.139
 the problem of the ring nut can be avoided 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.540
 pasting the aluminum ring a 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.739
 in short, the plastic one 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.060
 small problems are solvable and then 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.699
 all these solutions will do this 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.019
 shower a torch in my opinion enough 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 reliable guys i hope this 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.710
 video review you came back useful 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.509
 for your future purchase I hope the 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.639
 video you enjoyed proved new
