00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that he was talking about was done

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.380 
that he was talking about was done

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
next they were not paid to undertake

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
next they were not paid to undertake
additional<00:01:33.990> platforms<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.710> once<00:01:35.400> again

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
additional platforms as once again

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
additional platforms as once again
stated<00:01:35.850> by<00:01:36.060> Dean<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.900> crazy

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
stated by Dean it's kind of a crazy
theory<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.130> wouldn't<00:01:38.340> surprise<00:01:38.400> most<00:01:39.390> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

lot of people were worried about was the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
lot of people were worried about was the
fact<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.130> PC<00:01:44.610> may<00:01:44.790> lack<00:01:45.030> features<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
fact that the PC may lack features in

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
fact that the PC may lack features in
order<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.079> match<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> consoles<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> once

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
again this is not true as rocket States

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.310
