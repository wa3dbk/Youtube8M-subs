00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 the calorie predominated in all Brazilian regions and the weekend 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460
 it will be very similar to saw 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.220
 Just that I'm not from Brazil comes from pure water and has forecast for big 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 It is expected to rain heavily in most of the southern region but this Saturday 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.829

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.299
 in the southeast region the position is guaranteed this Saturday and the 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.280

 in forecast also for storms in much of the state of Bahia 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.009
 but also with great heat look only the one that is the maximum predicted for the 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.299
 Saturday in much of Brazil 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.430

 the south of Brazil despite the possibility even for great storms 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.200
 is still going to make bird heat is there that lives the danger saw heat along with 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.560
 cold front and that always give that result that we already have 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.359
 knows 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.660
 great storms 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.870
 hulk more water in southern Brazil we will have heavy rains between the rio grande do sul 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.950
 Santa Catarina 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.450
 and the paraná in the case of parana will play on Sunday mainly in the south of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.610
 state and early next week 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.740
 you will gain even more strength in the state of Paraná 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 in the southeast region the sun and heat of Sunday 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.029
 the rain showers at the end of the day in the state of são paulo 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.990
 our orientation is just the rain 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.120
 You can enjoy it a lot. 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.620
 and that is why today we go to the São Paulo Guarujá coast and the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.090
 municipality that is in the state of são paulo 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.870
 and I there in the Santista lowland currently the para is already known as there 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.950
 of the Atlantic due to its beautiful beaches and with natural beauties the city attracts 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.019
 tourists mainly in high season season almost all 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.319
 beaches are arranged for family have feeding restrooms 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.520
 and in some you can even rent jet skis that banana boat 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.700
 As examples of these beaches are pitangueiras cove to spturis and are 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.320
 Peter 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.920
 the aie also has good blood pressure beaches the most famous are the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.279
 pernambuco 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.369
 pigeon 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:01.579
 in addition there are some wild beaches also that are accessible 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.130
 only by saved trails 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.100
 besides the coast now also offers historical buildings and the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.149
 showcases direct tourism ' 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:15.719
 another really cool option and I blame it and the artisanal fishing that can be seen and 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.800
 practiced in several beaches of the municipality 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.100
 and then I liked the tip 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.770
 and will the weather help of course that helps the weekend will be typical of 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.160
 summer and this in all the state of são paulo saw in the paulistano coast for already 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.220
 for example minimum of 23 for Saturday 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.190
 it means that on Saturday it will start late 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.109
 the maximum must exceed these 28 degrees 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.129
 this possibility said the material something you think do not disturb the end 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.139
 not so much is that on Sunday the sun appears again the temperature goes 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.349
 pass the 30 degrees on the guarujá 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.959
 just wanted you not to come because it has forecast strong rain at the end of 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:52.540
 Sunday 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.930
 then you intending to descend the cautious mountain on the roads you can 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.730
 find wet tracks 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.300
 and reduced visibility 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.530
 is what I said besides the guarujá of the coast of São Paulo we will also have the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.420
 presence of salt in other areas of the state of São Paulo so 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.220
 renato barreto the 34 degrees true calorie and in the São Paulo capital as well 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.100
 not live this weekend is guaranteed with a minimum of 19 and maximum of 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.170
 31 degrees 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.740
 these on Saturday and Sunday as well 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.910
 but look beyond all these tips I have also the most important tip 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.930
 protect your skin 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.270
 even if the sun does not appear the ultraviolet index follows quite high this in the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.880
 most of brazil 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.790
 mainly here in hama in the central region where we have an index that 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.419
 ultraviolet extreme 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.470

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:48.050
