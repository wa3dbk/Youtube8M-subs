00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
outfit I usually always go back to this
and<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.320> had<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.009> four<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.759> five

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and I've had this for about four or five

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810 
and I've had this for about four or five
years<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.070> boho

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
years and I think it's just very boho

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.570 
years and I think it's just very boho
but<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:25.080> dressier<00:01:25.530> boho<00:01:26.100> there's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
but like a little dressier boho there's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
but like a little dressier boho there's
no<00:01:26.790> fringe<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.780> love<00:01:27.990> fringe<00:01:28.259> but

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
no fringe on here and I love fringe but

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
no fringe on here and I love fringe but
I<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.850> why<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> makes<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.659> little

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I think that's why it makes it a little

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.719 
I think that's why it makes it a little
bit<00:01:30.990> dressier<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:31.799> gold<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.369> um

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
bit dressier there's more gold and um

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.230 
bit dressier there's more gold and um
just<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:33.990> dressier<00:01:34.409> yes<00:01:35.240> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.729 
and all my uncle's some pictures on my
blog<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.660> think<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.319> slip

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
blog but I just think this slip

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.440 
blog but I just think this slip
underneath<00:02:25.129> just<00:02:25.370> really<00:02:25.879> makes<00:02:26.120> this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
underneath just really makes this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.449 
underneath just really makes this
because<00:02:26.780> if<00:02:27.140> there<00:02:27.470> wasn't<00:02:27.769> for<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.220> slip

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
because if there wasn't for the slip

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.570 
because if there wasn't for the slip
this<00:02:28.640> would<00:02:28.819> be<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.209> very<00:02:29.420> plain<00:02:29.750> Jersey

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
this would be just a very plain Jersey

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.800 
this would be just a very plain Jersey
high-low<00:02:31.580> dress<00:02:31.730> which<00:02:32.450> there's<00:02:32.660> nothing

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
high-low dress which there's nothing

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.150

wrong<00:02:33.110> with<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.620> just<00:02:33.680> think<00:02:34.010> this

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
wrong with that that I just think this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.059 
wrong with that that I just think this
slip<00:02:34.459> ass<00:02:34.670> lifetime<00:02:35.629> of<00:02:35.750> interest<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.560> it's
