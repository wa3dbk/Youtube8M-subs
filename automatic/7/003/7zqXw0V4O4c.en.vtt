00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.820
 Hello everyone, I decided to do today 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 training video how to build a rubik's cube 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:16.890
 two for two here he is himself this cube 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.590
 almost the same as Carina 3 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.130
 like three by three but there is none 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.790
 these edges are not these centers 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.590
 accordingly, how about them? 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.200
 navigate around the corners about it 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.750
 I will tell you more about the pose of many people 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.790
 think that 3 by 3 and it is very difficult to collect 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.620
 and not on rate two by two think about 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.750
 I will easily collect this cube and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.000
 most and long break them 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.930
 head after all this is a puzzle and not 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.930
 they can only collect it 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.730
 of eight corners and what's most interesting and 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.450
 in two by two his business to do is one 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.309
 total in all cubes is eight corners 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:03.030
 just the more cube so can robert 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.030
 and centers and so how do you choose 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:12.760
 I will explain in detail in the simplest way 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 what are there any we take 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.920
 top up start collecting the white side 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.950
 just so convenient here white side 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.130
 white corner can start with any any 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.820
 place from anywhere and so here is white 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.890
 the angle he is red-blue means we need 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 find either blue or red and here 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.520
 white and blue we compare them with the squad 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.990
 here it is white blue orange 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:45.340
 here it is white white orange we begin 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.770
 so we match, let's insert here the cube 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.610
 so that you need to put it so 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 let down 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.090
 this lead this to revive 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:07.349
 it is to revive and there is such 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:10.239
 it still happens when the corner looks to me 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.880
 somewhere the side is also back to normal 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.030
 site in a big way a down 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 In this case, this edge will be necessary 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.170
 omit this one two times 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.200
 also raise and then argue the usual 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.280
 This video, see see those who already 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.510
 know how to bertelli inside 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.120
 what will be involved here 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.810
 algorithm for 3 3 so when we 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.460
 turned upside down 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.260
 here come 7 different situations and each 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.400
 of them are solved only by two algorithms 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.350
 easiest build and so we are looking 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.860
 wrong angle that start right 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.080
 which looks not down here 1 and 2 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.580
 there are two options either looking at you 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.990
 either he looks at the rights so we take 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.900
 we start found well let's say the term is vague 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.910
 the right itself to this place is not important 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.820
 which one but to our rely on here and 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:12.120
 doing bang-bang goes twice to all 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.470
 throw don't worry important it is on 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.410
 same place insert another angle and on 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.200
 same place drove our corner too 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.200
 looks at us and the thing is this algorithm 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280
 the second thing 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.180
 turn and look side 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:41.310
 gathered and here are a few 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.420
 different options when you need it here 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.540
 all this is all to collect 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.709
 we are looking for two matching in color from 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.520
 the most appropriate color and look 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.100
 here these 2 cubes need memory space so 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.080
 we turn so doing such a lari 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:06.260
 there are the first four entrances and now 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.260
 turns r3 role 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:24.960
 the cube is still going to be like this 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:28.830
 situation when two dice need to change 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:35.360
 on the diagonal then we do the same 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:38.490
 the algorithm is not important to take anyway and 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.270
 we certainly get that two 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:50.910
 rows if we then all let light 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.860
 do the same so thanks for 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.570
 viewing 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.570
 well how to become comments light
