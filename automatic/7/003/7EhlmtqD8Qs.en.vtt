have no idea what just happened which
you<00:00:27.779> probably<00:00:28.199> don't<00:00:28.769> um<00:00:29.179> that<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.420> made<00:00:30.599> use

of<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.140> nifty<00:00:31.500> little<00:00:31.679> glitch<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.219> Minecraft

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
of a nifty little glitch in Minecraft

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.750 
of a nifty little glitch in Minecraft
which<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.870> more<00:00:34.770> than<00:00:34.829> five

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
which is if you have more than five

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.500 
which is if you have more than five
carts<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> any<00:00:36.809> kind<00:00:37.170> occupying<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.850> same<00:00:39.149> um

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
carts of any kind occupying the same um

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.900 
carts of any kind occupying the same um
rail<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.800> any<00:00:41.010> given<00:00:41.340> time<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> they're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
rail at any given time and they're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.690 
rail at any given time and they're
pushed<00:00:42.210> off<00:00:42.420> they'll<00:00:43.379> keep<00:00:43.649> moving<00:00:44.280> for

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
pushed off they'll keep moving for

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
pushed off they'll keep moving for
whatever<00:00:45.000> reason<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.690> don't<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.289> kind

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
whatever reason I don't know what kind

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.930 
whatever reason I don't know what kind
of<00:00:46.530> coding<00:00:46.890> bug<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.640> they'll<00:00:47.760> just

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of coding bug this is but they'll just

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.250 
of coding bug this is but they'll just
move<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.860> infinitely<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.050> saw

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
move on infinitely so if you you saw

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
move on infinitely so if you you saw
like<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> player<00:00:53.190> pushes<00:00:53.640> them<00:00:53.789> off

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
like that if a player pushes them off

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
like that if a player pushes them off
and<00:00:54.090> move<00:00:54.239> diagonally<00:00:54.870> however<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> power

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and move diagonally however if a power

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
and move diagonally however if a power
rail<00:00:56.129> pushes<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.180> example<00:00:57.629> miss

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
rail pushes them off for example miss

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.189 
rail pushes them off for example miss
that<00:00:58.579> they<00:00:59.579> will<00:00:59.789> move<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.239> straight<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.020> let

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that they will move on straight so let

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
that they will move on straight so let
me<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.410> place<00:01:01.620> down<00:01:01.800> five<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.340> again

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
me just place down five of these again

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.649 
me just place down five of these again
like<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.519> they'll<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:06.270> towards

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
like so and then they'll just go towards

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.130 
like so and then they'll just go towards
whatever<00:01:06.900> stops<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.799> anyways<00:01:09.140> minecart

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
whatever stops them anyways minecart

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
whatever stops them anyways minecart
TNT's<00:01:10.830> however<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.790> fairly<00:01:12.390> different

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
TNT's however have fairly different

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
TNT's however have fairly different
logic<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.159> stopped<00:01:14.549> by

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
logic because when they are stopped by

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.010 
logic because when they are stopped by
something<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.729> explode<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.240> hold<00:01:18.930> on

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
something they will explode so hold on

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
something they will explode so hold on
let<00:01:19.170> me<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.439> move<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> yes<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.549> like

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
let me just move and yes you can like

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.179 
let me just move and yes you can like
kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.299> rear<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:22.020> aim<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
kind of rear out there aim like so so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
kind of rear out there aim like so so
now<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.729> aiming<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.390> house<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.869> there

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
now I'm aiming it that house right there

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.039 
now I'm aiming it that house right there
so<00:01:25.350> let's<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.400> 15<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.570> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
so let's put down 15 because that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
so let's put down 15 because that
emotion<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.829> saw<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.250> an<00:01:29.340> explosion<00:01:29.640> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
emotion you just saw was an explosion of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.450 
emotion you just saw was an explosion of
10<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.420> yes<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.590> these<00:01:31.860> mobile

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
10 so yes to make these mobile

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.719 
10 so yes to make these mobile
explosives<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.840> place<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.380> TMT<00:01:35.040> minecarts

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
explosives just place down TMT minecarts

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.390 
explosives just place down TMT minecarts
on<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> track<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.350> order<00:01:37.619> let's<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
on a track actually in order let's just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.889 
on a track actually in order let's just
see<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:39.000> big<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> smallest<00:01:39.720> explosion<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
see how big the smallest explosion is so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
see how big the smallest explosion is so
okay<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:42.930> six<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:43.950> than<00:01:44.100> five<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
okay so six one more than five which is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
okay so six one more than five which is
what's<00:01:44.970> needed<00:01:45.149> for<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> witch<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.020> happen

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
what's needed for the witch to happen

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.840 
what's needed for the witch to happen
otherwise<00:01:46.829> when<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> card<00:01:47.460> sleeves<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
otherwise when the card sleeves the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.789 
otherwise when the card sleeves the
track<00:01:48.030> though<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.479> stop<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.110> hit<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.439> switch

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
track though just stop so hit the switch

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.230 
track though just stop so hit the switch
it<00:01:50.250> moves<00:01:50.909> oh<00:01:51.270> oh<00:01:52.009> that's<00:01:53.009> interesting<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it moves oh oh that's interesting I can

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.850 
it moves oh oh that's interesting I can
honestly<00:01:54.329> say<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.780> did<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.710> if

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
honestly say I did not know that so if

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.840 
honestly say I did not know that so if
it<00:01:55.979> turns<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:57.000> move<00:01:57.149> diagonally<00:01:57.840> huh

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it turns it will move diagonally huh

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
it turns it will move diagonally huh
well<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.090> long<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.350> little

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
well as long as we have this little

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.179 
well as long as we have this little
setup<00:02:01.920> let's<00:02:02.340> set<00:02:02.520> off<00:02:02.610> another<00:02:02.759> explosion<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
setup let's set off another explosion so

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.410 
setup let's set off another explosion so
push<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:06.350> six<00:02:07.350> turn<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> goes

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
push down six turn it on there it goes

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.809 
push down six turn it on there it goes
so<00:02:10.170> now<00:02:10.349> I'll<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.649> keep<00:02:10.830> moving<00:02:11.069> until<00:02:11.400> it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so now I'll just keep moving until it

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.610 
so now I'll just keep moving until it
hits<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.390> house<00:02:12.599> right<00:02:12.840> there

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
hits that house right there

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.289 
hits that house right there
in<00:02:13.680> which<00:02:13.920> case<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.310> will<00:02:14.430> explode<00:02:14.879> sending

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
in which case it will explode sending

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.780 
in which case it will explode sending
off<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.659> very<00:02:16.019> large<00:02:16.319> explosion<00:02:16.950> sense<00:02:17.610> of

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
off a very large explosion sense of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.100 
off a very large explosion sense of
course<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.239> explosion<00:02:18.569> would<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
course that explosion would have the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.170 
course that explosion would have the
power<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.470> ten<00:02:19.709> TNT's<00:02:20.340> all<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.940> off<00:02:21.030> from

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
power of ten TNT's all going off from

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.360 
power of ten TNT's all going off from
the<00:02:21.330> same<00:02:21.510> spot<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:23.150> since<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.810> next<00:02:25.370> ugly

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the same spot now since the next ugly

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.339 
the same spot now since the next ugly
the<00:02:26.519> next<00:02:26.819> thing<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:27.599> just<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
the next thing to do we're just to be to

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.280 
the next thing to do we're just to be to
set<00:02:28.530> up<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.769> huge<00:02:29.069> explosion<00:02:29.519> on<00:02:30.060> over<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:31.049> if

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
set up a huge explosion on over there if

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
set up a huge explosion on over there if
you<00:02:31.349> can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.159> have<00:02:32.310> 50<00:02:32.970> minecart<00:02:33.450> ents

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
you can see that I have 50 minecart ents

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.259 
you can see that I have 50 minecart ents
all<00:02:34.230> sitting<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> exact<00:02:35.400> same<00:02:35.610> spot<00:02:35.849> and

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
all sitting in the exact same spot and

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.119 
all sitting in the exact same spot and
then<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> set<00:02:37.049> up<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> little<00:02:37.440> system<00:02:37.769> here<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
then I set up a little system here to

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.830 
then I set up a little system here to
launch<00:02:38.430> them<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.940> we're<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.269> going<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.569> do

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
launch them so we're just going to do

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.930 
launch them so we're just going to do
that<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.200> watch<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.829> Smith<00:02:41.190> 3<00:02:41.459> be<00:02:41.610> blown<00:02:41.909> to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
that and watch that Smith 3 be blown to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.110 
that and watch that Smith 3 be blown to
shreds<00:02:42.349> hate<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.709> turn<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.159> up<00:02:44.489> there<00:02:44.970> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
shreds hate so we turn it on up there it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.380 
shreds hate so we turn it on up there it
is<00:02:45.560> coming<00:02:46.560> onto<00:02:46.829> screen<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:48.269> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
is coming onto screen there this is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.589 
is coming onto screen there this is
going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.569> like<00:02:48.720> my<00:02:48.930> game<00:02:49.109> pretty<00:02:49.379> bad<00:02:49.620> way<00:02:49.829> and

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
going to like my game pretty bad way and

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.750 
going to like my game pretty bad way and
32<00:02:52.129> boom<00:02:54.859> now<00:02:55.859> whenever<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.459> make<00:02:56.579> an

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
32 boom now whenever you make an

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.339 
32 boom now whenever you make an
explosion<00:02:57.359> this<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.900> something<00:02:58.109> I've

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
explosion this is just something I've

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.069 
explosion this is just something I've
noticed<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:59.190> bigger<00:02:59.819> than<00:02:59.940> about<00:03:00.599> 30<00:03:00.989> of

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
noticed like bigger than about 30 of

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.599 
noticed like bigger than about 30 of
these<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.440> minecart<00:03:01.829> team<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.220> use<00:03:02.370> it

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
these little minecart team to use it

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.640 
these little minecart team to use it
leaves<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.150> weird<00:03:03.420> little<00:03:03.629> rim<00:03:04.019> around<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
leaves this weird little rim around the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.410 
leaves this weird little rim around the
explosion<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.489> I'm<00:03:05.730> not<00:03:05.849> sure<00:03:05.909> what<00:03:06.120> that's

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
explosion so I'm not sure what that's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.009 
explosion so I'm not sure what that's
from<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:07.140> also<00:03:07.829> doesn't<00:03:08.370> destroy<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.599> blocks

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
from it also doesn't destroy like blocks

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.500 
from it also doesn't destroy like blocks
directly<00:03:10.859> sideways<00:03:11.489> from<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.359> leaves

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
directly sideways from it like it leaves

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.880 
directly sideways from it like it leaves
this<00:03:12.659> little<00:03:12.930> killer<00:03:13.140> going<00:03:13.440> out<00:03:13.560> kind<00:03:13.829> of

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
this little killer going out kind of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.979 
this little killer going out kind of
strange<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:15.120> was<00:03:15.299> you'll<00:03:15.510> see<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
strange it was you'll see that it

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.379 
strange it was you'll see that it
actually<00:03:16.019> drops<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.220> minecart<00:03:17.639> entities<00:03:18.090> so

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
actually drops the minecart entities so

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.479 
actually drops the minecart entities so
really<00:03:18.750> all<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.109> need<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.440> do<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:20.040> um<00:03:20.430> a

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
really all you need to do this is um a

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.150 
really all you need to do this is um a
supply<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.299> T&amp;T<00:03:21.810> since<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.859> reuse<00:03:23.010> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
supply of T&amp;T since you can reuse the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.229 
supply of T&amp;T since you can reuse the
minecarts<00:03:23.819> okay<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.620> i<00:03:26.069> don't<00:03:26.639> know<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:26.970> thing

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
minecarts okay so i don't know one thing

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.479 
minecarts okay so i don't know one thing
so<00:03:27.599> that's<00:03:28.079> really<00:03:28.380> how<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.099> but<00:03:29.129> I'm

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
so that's really how you do it but I'm

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.949 
so that's really how you do it but I'm
going<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.669> keep<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.389> because<00:03:30.660> I

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
going to keep going just because I

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.330 
going to keep going just because I
thought<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.349> occurred<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.859> me<00:03:32.099> when<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> was

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
thought that occurred to me when I was

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.089 
thought that occurred to me when I was
doing<00:03:32.579> this<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.870> could<00:03:34.379> be<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> way<00:03:34.829> to

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
doing this was this could be a way to

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.240 
doing this was this could be a way to
blow<00:03:35.849> up<00:03:36.379> obsidian<00:03:37.379> hold<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.739> i'm<00:03:37.829> just<00:03:38.010> going

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
blow up obsidian hold on i'm just going

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.949 
blow up obsidian hold on i'm just going
to<00:03:38.280> another<00:03:38.639> testing<00:03:39.090> site<00:03:39.269> i<00:03:39.299> have<00:03:39.510> over<00:03:39.660> here

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to another testing site i have over here

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.720 
to another testing site i have over here
i<00:03:40.109> thought<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.739> myself<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.190> could<00:03:41.400> be<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> way

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
i thought to myself this could be a way

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.500 
i thought to myself this could be a way
to<00:03:41.760> destroy<00:03:42.510> obsidian<00:03:43.319> in<00:03:44.000> Minecraft<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.209> mean

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
to destroy obsidian in Minecraft I mean

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.930 
to destroy obsidian in Minecraft I mean
like<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.199> survival<00:03:46.769> mode<00:03:46.799> assuming<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:47.699> have

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
like in survival mode assuming you have

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.530 
like in survival mode assuming you have
of<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.019> ton<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.290> TNT<00:03:49.829> at<00:03:49.949> your<00:03:50.099> disposal

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
of just a ton of TNT at your disposal

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.270 
of just a ton of TNT at your disposal
anyway<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.989> did<00:03:52.169> some<00:03:52.349> testing<00:03:52.769> over<00:03:53.040> here

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
anyway so I did some testing over here

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.189 
anyway so I did some testing over here
and<00:03:53.459> first<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.940> all<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.540> case<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.959> do<00:03:55.169> not

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
and first of all on in case you do not

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.670 
and first of all on in case you do not
know<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.769> your<00:03:55.949> chests<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.639> half<00:03:57.419> the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
know and your chests have half the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.849 
know and your chests have half the
explosion<00:03:59.480> resistance<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.720> obsidian<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.620> yes

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
explosion resistance of obsidian and yes

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.890 
explosion resistance of obsidian and yes
it's<00:04:02.069> upsetting<00:04:02.699> will<00:04:03.120> explode<00:04:03.660> from<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
it's upsetting will explode from the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.250 
it's upsetting will explode from the
large<00:04:04.199> enough<00:04:04.879> explosion<00:04:05.879> so<00:04:06.690> what<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.930> did<00:04:07.049> was

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
large enough explosion so what I did was

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.909 
large enough explosion so what I did was
I<00:04:07.620> stacked<00:04:08.010> over<00:04:08.599> 300<00:04:09.599> TMT<00:04:10.290> mine<00:04:10.470> carts<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.829> the

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
I stacked over 300 TMT mine carts in the

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.800 
I stacked over 300 TMT mine carts in the
same<00:04:11.160> spot<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:11.940> was<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.269> result<00:04:12.449> right

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
same spot and this was the result right

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.770 
same spot and this was the result right
here<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.650> can<00:04:13.799> see<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.340> did<00:04:14.639> not<00:04:14.849> destroy<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
here you can see it did not destroy the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.560 
here you can see it did not destroy the
chest<00:04:16.199> and<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:17.190> kind<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.579> left<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.940> little<00:04:18.120> area

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
chest and it kind of left a little area

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.620 
chest and it kind of left a little area
that<00:04:18.870> was<00:04:18.989> blocked<00:04:19.320> by<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.500> chest<00:04:19.859> back<00:04:20.130> here

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that was blocked by the chest back here

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.990 
that was blocked by the chest back here
so<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.900> ways<00:04:22.140> my<00:04:23.039> fame<00:04:23.250> will<00:04:23.400> actually<00:04:23.789> on

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so in ways my fame will actually on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.930 
so in ways my fame will actually on
crash<00:04:24.719> if<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.260> do<00:04:25.320> about<00:04:25.950> 400

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
crash if I do about 400

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.110 
crash if I do about 400
team<00:04:27.600> I'm<00:04:27.780> carts<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:28.230> more<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.700> don't<00:04:30.030> know

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
team I'm carts or more so I don't know

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.000 
team I'm carts or more so I don't know
but<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.510> advise<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:30.900> not<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.350> do<00:04:31.650> more<00:04:31.860> than

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
but I advise you not to do more than

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.590 
but I advise you not to do more than
that<00:04:32.130> or<00:04:32.400> else<00:04:32.520> your<00:04:32.760> game<00:04:32.910> will<00:04:33.090> probably

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
that or else your game will probably

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.800 
that or else your game will probably
crash<00:04:34.460> okay<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.240> if<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.450> just<00:04:36.660> want

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
crash okay so and then if you just want

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.590 
crash okay so and then if you just want
to<00:04:36.900> mess<00:04:37.470> around<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:38.490> doesn't<00:04:38.910> these<00:04:39.330> don't

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
to mess around it doesn't these don't

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.700 
to mess around it doesn't these don't
need<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.990> be<00:04:40.110> launched<00:04:40.530> from<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:42.620> what<00:04:43.620> are

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
need to be launched from a what are

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.500 
need to be launched from a what are
these<00:04:43.800> called<00:04:44.040> power<00:04:44.280> rails<00:04:44.640> they<00:04:45.210> can<00:04:45.360> just

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
these called power rails they can just

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.360 
these called power rails they can just
be<00:04:45.630> launched<00:04:45.870> from<00:04:45.900> normal<00:04:46.260> rails<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.740> from

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
be launched from normal rails to from

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.400 
be launched from normal rails to from
the<00:04:47.490> player<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.360> watch<00:04:48.600> I'll<00:04:48.810> watch<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:49.170> one

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
the player so watch I'll watch this one

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.390 
the player so watch I'll watch this one
off<00:04:49.650> at<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.010> church<00:04:50.700> right<00:04:50.910> there<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.890> how

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
off at that church right there and how

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.870 
off at that church right there and how
many<00:04:53.610> was<00:04:53.730> that<00:04:53.760> 10<00:04:54.450> ish<00:04:54.630> sick<00:04:55.020> oh<00:04:55.200> jeez<00:04:55.880> yeah

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
many was that 10 ish sick oh jeez yeah

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.430 
many was that 10 ish sick oh jeez yeah
you<00:04:56.940> can<00:04:57.120> see<00:04:57.270> these<00:04:57.420> explosions<00:04:57.840> get<00:04:58.170> pretty

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
you can see these explosions get pretty

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.510 
you can see these explosions get pretty
big<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.100> that's<00:04:59.850> about<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.150> how<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.480> make<00:05:00.780> um

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
big so that's about it how to make um

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.460 
big so that's about it how to make um
that's<00:05:02.520> how<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:02.910> make<00:05:03.180> mobile<00:05:03.390> explosions<00:05:04.260> in

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
that's how to make mobile explosions in

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.950 
that's how to make mobile explosions in
Minecraft<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.240> now<00:05:06.240> i'm<00:05:06.480> probably<00:05:06.690> going<00:05:06.870> to

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
Minecraft so now i'm probably going to

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.170 
Minecraft so now i'm probably going to
call<00:05:07.200> these<00:05:07.350> missiles<00:05:07.980> or<00:05:08.190> something<00:05:08.580> mobile

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
call these missiles or something mobile

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.210 
call these missiles or something mobile
super<00:05:09.810> explosives<00:05:10.410> because<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.800> mean<00:05:11.040> that's

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
super explosives because I mean that's

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.640 
super explosives because I mean that's
pretty<00:05:11.370> much<00:05:11.580> what<00:05:11.790> they<00:05:11.910> are<00:05:12.230> so<00:05:13.230> yeah<00:05:13.500> and

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
pretty much what they are so yeah and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.510 
pretty much what they are so yeah and
then<00:05:13.890> one<00:05:14.280> thing<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.580> tried<00:05:16.160> actually<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:17.490> know

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
then one thing I tried actually you know

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730 
then one thing I tried actually you know
what<00:05:17.700> i'll<00:05:17.790> say<00:05:17.880> i<00:05:18.600> kind<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.080> mantra<00:05:19.260> destroy

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
what i'll say i kind of mantra destroy

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.320 
what i'll say i kind of mantra destroy
obsidian<00:05:20.280> with<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:20.790> i<00:05:20.820> think<00:05:21.120> i'm<00:05:21.240> going

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
obsidian with this but i think i'm going

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.690 
obsidian with this but i think i'm going
to<00:05:21.390> save<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.690> for<00:05:22.080> another<00:05:22.110> video<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.220> if<00:05:23.550> you

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
to save that for another video so if you

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.350 
to save that for another video so if you
guys<00:05:23.850> do<00:05:24.060> want<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.360> see<00:05:24.510> me<00:05:24.690> try<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:24.990> blow<00:05:25.560> up

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
guys do want to see me try to blow up

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.420 
guys do want to see me try to blow up
obsidian<00:05:27.360> with<00:05:27.540> this<00:05:27.690> technique<00:05:28.430> they'll

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
obsidian with this technique they'll

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.280 
obsidian with this technique they'll
probably<00:05:29.760> be<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> link<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.690> video<00:05:30.990> right

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
probably be a link to the video right

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.250 
probably be a link to the video right
now<00:05:31.320> in<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.680> top<00:05:31.860> right<00:05:32.130> if<00:05:32.370> i<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:33.080> made<00:05:34.080> the

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
now in the top right if i have made the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.200 
now in the top right if i have made the
video<00:05:34.410> if<00:05:34.740> not<00:05:34.980> I<00:05:35.220> guess<00:05:35.550> I<00:05:35.669> just<00:05:35.700> haven't<00:05:36.000> made

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
video if not I guess I just haven't made

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.600 
video if not I guess I just haven't made
it<00:05:36.270> yet<00:05:36.440> so<00:05:37.440> right<00:05:38.070> now<00:05:38.100> I'm<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.430> setting

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
it yet so right now I'm just setting

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.340 
it yet so right now I'm just setting
gonna<00:05:38.940> set<00:05:39.180> up<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.300> final<00:05:39.570> boom<00:05:39.900> for<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.169> guys
