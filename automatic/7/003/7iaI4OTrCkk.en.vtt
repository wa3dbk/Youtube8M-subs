00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
say in there we have some bug's to work

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.200 
say in there we have some bug's to work
out<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.300 

here's<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.360> problem<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:42.380> ropes<00:01:42.650> were<00:01:42.979> in<00:01:43.159> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
here's the problem the ropes were in the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.070 
here's the problem the ropes were in the
way<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.729> know<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:44.060> know<00:01:44.240> John<00:01:44.510> if<00:01:44.690> he<00:01:44.780> didn't

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
way you know you know John if he didn't

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.560 
way you know you know John if he didn't
have<00:01:45.229> those<00:01:45.470> ropes<00:01:45.830> look<00:01:46.460> at<00:01:46.580> this<00:01:46.700> he<00:01:47.330> could

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
have those ropes look at this he could

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.600 
have those ropes look at this he could
have<00:01:47.659> just<00:01:47.720> kept<00:01:48.170> right<00:01:48.410> on<00:01:48.470> dude<00:01:48.950> Ian<00:01:49.190> but

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
have just kept right on dude Ian but

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.250 
have just kept right on dude Ian but
this<00:01:49.760> technique<00:01:50.210> could<00:01:50.390> work<00:01:50.660> in<00:01:50.870> an<00:01:50.960> open

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
this technique could work in an open

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.920 
this technique could work in an open
