00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
lot about my own teaching and how to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.449 
lot about my own teaching and how to
make<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.670> topic<00:02:39.360> accessible<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.709> just<00:02:40.769> to

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
make the topic accessible not just to

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.820 
make the topic accessible not just to
the<00:02:42.450> student<00:02:42.810> who<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.049> participating<00:02:43.410> from

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the student who was participating from

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.949 
the student who was participating from
up<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.130> hill<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:45.060> whole<00:02:45.450> range<00:02:45.720> of

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
up the hill but a whole range of

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.979 
up the hill but a whole range of
students<00:02:46.769> as<00:02:46.920> well<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:48.330> other<00:02:48.360> students<00:02:48.870> were

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
students as well the other students were

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.289 
students as well the other students were
sent<00:02:49.200> readings<00:02:49.769> which<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.489> knew<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.850> Michael

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
sent readings which I knew that Michael

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.199 
sent readings which I knew that Michael
wouldn't<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.660> able<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.549> had<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.030> think

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
wouldn't be able to do so I had to think

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.300 
wouldn't be able to do so I had to think
of<00:02:54.360> activities<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.290> group<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.950> he<00:02:56.130> was

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
of activities for the group that he was

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.340 
of activities for the group that he was
in<00:02:56.489> there<00:02:57.180> weren't<00:02:57.630> based<00:02:57.780> around<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
in there weren't based around the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.870 
in there weren't based around the
readings<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.950> were<00:02:59.070> maybe<00:02:59.250> based<00:02:59.549> around

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
readings that were maybe based around

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.539 
readings that were maybe based around
them<00:03:00.120> watching<00:03:00.930> movies<00:03:01.680> or<00:03:01.980> things<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.459> were

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
them watching movies or things that were

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.220 
them watching movies or things that were
on<00:03:02.610> TV<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:03.600> would<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.840> able<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
on TV so that he would be able to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.289 
on TV so that he would be able to
participate<00:03:04.739> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.459> group<00:03:05.610> as<00:03:05.850> much<00:03:06.060> as<00:03:06.239> he

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299
