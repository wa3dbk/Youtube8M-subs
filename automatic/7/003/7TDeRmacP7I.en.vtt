00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.509
 is very common when recording 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.630
 Online guitar is with a pedalboard a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.240
 analog pedal or those pedals 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.340
 that comes with usb connection for you to call 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 directly the computer is very common 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.949
 that the sound is very robotic, right? 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.289
 The final sound is that synthetic sound 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.599
 so let's have a tip today of how to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.930
 people can ease this type of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.380
 recording if you use a system for 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 make recording your guitar 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.440
 The pedalboard I'm using here is new. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 a g3 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 I really like her team but she has 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 This problem every time we went to make 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 line recording or USB cable is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 with this synthetic sound 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.020
 then the way to soften or we will not 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.789
 now also have this trick 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.329
 The simulation of the amplifier I 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.370
 the ANP as well as properly stamped and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
 platform that I used to record is the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.979
 sonar nexus one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.760
 Come on then let's listen to the recording. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.760
 with the original sound 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.229
 now let's see how you get the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.229
 ground 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.450
 look okay 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.450
 i ching 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.170
 now we are going to the place where the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.180
 track effects in the case of sonar fx 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.599
 by right-clicking and 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:24.970
 let's choose the audio fx option that the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:28.150
 Alki Yankee Yes we will choose here 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.220
 the cabinet option 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.250
 once chosen let's just paste in 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.050
 each track that has the guitar recorded 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.100
 now let's hear the sound with the simulation 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.100
 of the cabinet 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.360
 is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.700
 now with the ground 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.770
 is 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.910
 i 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.820
 It's very personal, I hope you have 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.820
 liked this tip and until the next time
