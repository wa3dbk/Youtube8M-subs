00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.590
 I write stamps for more than 20 years 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.750
 who wrote the truth had a grandfather 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 that he was very quiet that he had a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.400
 very large library and my mom told me 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 throw the writer and that seems to me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.620
 important also had an uncle who was 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.090
 a great great talker photographer who 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.660
 he talked to me a lot about literature and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.950
 we had conversations like that very carefree 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.100
 let say 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.480
 and had a collection of magazines 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.600
 pornographic that were very good and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.270
 besides literature and good and that's why 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.550
 let's say basically from there 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 I went into what is literature I started 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.700
 to write known things and authors 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.960
 as henry miller as between 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.800
 on that side but I really remembered 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.490
 I 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.089
 before writing I started improvising 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.890
 towards progressing radio with in a studio 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.910
 radio with marcelo rule and another chabón 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.620
 and then writing really allows that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:18.100
 one can explore the words that one 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:23.140
 write or read from another way 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.170
 Redefines or rediscovers literature 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.740
 another way the oral poetry of some 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.729
 way proves that which which no longer 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.810
 it's just words but how you live those 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.270
 words 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.030
 there is always something else there is something more than what 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.100
 that the book that written paper is not there 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.580
 limits there are no limits the poetry in 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.400
 Yes it is lived differently and play 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.190
 all the time with the rules are broken 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.250
 my friends that many I consider them 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.200
 poets and they see in a very extra way the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.630
 area and doing things in a very 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.500
 extras to the area and they play all the time and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.640
 that's because there are really no rules 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.850
 the poetry is revealed from the rules if 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.230
 you can later if you can not do and as 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.230
 with good declamation 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.200
 my grandmother was an obsessive of the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.590
 cleaning besides that I hated to me 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.940
 grandfather whenever he could mistreat him 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.090
 in front of other people 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.880
 my grandfather hidden in a world apart 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.610
 he almost did not talk to me he was a player 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.560
 compulsive played the lottery lottery 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 but of all that the agency 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.880
 bets I had to offer you in your 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.980
 last months of life I slept sitting was 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 very fat and how he had problems 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.630
 cardiac patients did not bank sleep in another 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.490
 position besides that had a leg 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.160
 half rotten 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.740
 he did not want to attend to her because he did not know 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.660
 he banked hospital care so 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.460
 when they were improved and a 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.760
 ambulance did not accept it 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.320
 they would take and the paramedics had to 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.360
 keep going if the sick one 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.760
 because the half dead guy and everything 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.690
 I was conscious and if I did not accept that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.550
 they could not take it away 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.160
 they always told him he was going to die 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.340
 but my grandfather banked it that way 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.020
 whole months a weekend of my 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.600
 adolescence I found myself sleeping in his 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.730
 my grandmother's house had gone to see a 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.030
 his son and all his family to Lujan 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.420
 wearable then we two 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.850
 alone in the department we had all 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.370
 the night he was writhing in pain 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.380
 he coughed a lot sitting immovably in a 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.100
 armchair where he let the world pass 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.470
 watching huge fat television and the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.460
 Upholstered destroyed by constant use 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.380
 at one point that night he smiled and 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.730
 coughing told me 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.310
 in these moments one becomes very 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.069
 believer my grandfather was an atheist 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.680
 the next day I found him sitting with the 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.680
 eyes narrowed and a black vomit 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.300
 coming out of the lips like it was not a 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.459
 urgency to look for a dead person 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.459
 paramedics took a long time to 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.560
 arrive very much the prima clarita in 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.110
 how much he found out he put on a whole week 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.540
 the cousins ​​that my grandmother does not 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.490
 I saw it has been thirty years friends that my 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.460
 grandfather hated it is wrong to say children 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.630
 creditors companions of militancy 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.910
 club members with what my grandfather 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.760
 played ping-pong the owner of the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.370
 betting agency all fell in 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.530
 little time the department so I know 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.200
 he set up a wake in the house they arrived and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.290
 they arrived with my grandfather in the armchair with 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.290
 eyes half closed and a black vomit 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.970
 on my lips a political land of mine 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.460
 distribute coffee and relatives 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.040
 they chatted and remembered past times 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.020
 there in the living with my dead grandfather 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.720
 my grandmother had been the first 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.390
 appear in that house in the morning 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.480
 I chat something in private with the combo 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:18.050
 tearful and then he approached me and kissed me 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.300
 and he started to clean my grandmother boasted 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.950
 that no plant was dying plant 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.750
 that came to his balcony plant that 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.580
 grew up my grandmother boasted that the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.530
 ornaments that he liked were kept 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.080
 dozens of years as if you never 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.440
 nothing had happened the showcase looked 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.530
 impeccable the armchair my grandfather was a 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.580
 Wandering around relatives took 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.690
 coffee chatted and some even cried 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.700
 an ambulance arrived and came looking for 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.220
 the corpse needed to know five to 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.570
 raise them was a whale the lord did not 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.760
 it could be lifted by nowhere 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.530
 they even thought about taking the 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.260
 armchair with him over he was finally loaded 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.960
 they had the low pants you could see 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.330
 the ortho as dead was a fool 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.480
 I sat in front of the empty chair 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.690
 for hours that leather throne and 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.340
 foam the only broken object destroyed 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.590
 by the huge body 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.169
 my grandfather between the order the brightness and the 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.930
 housecleaning stood there in that 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.199
 been even months after his 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.870
 untouchable death as the ornaments or as 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.360
 the plants one day changed the upholstery 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.280
 or the armchair I do not remember 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:32.590
 in these moments one becomes very 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.590
 believer told me my grandfather was an atheist
