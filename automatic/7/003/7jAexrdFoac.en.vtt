00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a different kind of theme so we've got

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
a different kind of theme so we've got
the<00:00:45.780> legend<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.289> top<00:00:46.590> we've<00:00:47.160> also<00:00:47.340> got<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> team

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the legend up top we've also got a team

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
the legend up top we've also got a team
of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> season<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> actual

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
of the season in here but the actual

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.060 
of the season in here but the actual
team<00:00:50.160> itself<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.660> cheap<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.710> think

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
team itself is so cheap like I think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.420 
team itself is so cheap like I think
it's<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.930> 20k<00:00:54.930> without<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> team<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's about 20k without the team of the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.540 
it's about 20k without the team of the
season<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.629> legend<00:00:58.020> card<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
season and the legend card so if you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
season and the legend card so if you
wanted<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> fitness<00:01:01.109> squad

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
wanted it for a kind of fitness squad

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
wanted it for a kind of fitness squad
just<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> play<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.100> you're<00:01:02.940> probably

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
just to play about with you're probably

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
just to play about with you're probably
good<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.379> team<00:01:04.589> itself<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.159> really

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
good because the team itself is really

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.990 
good because the team itself is really
really<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.470> switch

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
really good and I think if you switch

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
really good and I think if you switch
Balotelli<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.780> Christian<00:01:10.290> bieri<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.920> then

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Balotelli with Christian bieri and then

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.270 
Balotelli with Christian bieri and then
throw<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:12.500> Brazilian<00:01:13.500> Center<00:01:13.770> attacking<00:01:14.159> mid

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
throw a Brazilian Center attacking mid

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
throw a Brazilian Center attacking mid
from<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> Syria<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.479> Hernandez<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
from the Syria like say Hernandez I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
from the Syria like say Hernandez I
think<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.490> would<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.640> work<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
think it would actually work that on the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
think it would actually work that on the
right<00:01:18.900> hand<00:01:19.080> side<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.619> center<00:01:20.400> attack

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
right hand side in the center attack

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
right hand side in the center attack
admit<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> changes<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
admit so it's a lot of changes here you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 
admit so it's a lot of changes here you
can<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.880> obviously<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
can really obviously see to make the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.569 
can really obviously see to make the
team<00:01:25.970> very<00:01:26.970> very<00:01:27.330> cheap<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:28.130> 20<00:01:29.130> k<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
team very very cheap like 20 k which is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.749 
team very very cheap like 20 k which is
pretty<00:01:30.060> good<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:31.320> away<00:01:31.439> oh<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> Alva<00:01:32.640> on

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
pretty good so go away oh and Alva on

pretty good so go away oh and Alva on
the<00:01:32.820> left<00:01:33.000> hand<00:01:33.180> side<00:01:33.299> never<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:33.930> use

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the left hand side never actually use

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.950 
the left hand side never actually use

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
poya before but he was really really

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.469 
poya before but he was really really
good<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.590> thoroughly<00:01:38.009> impressed

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
with how much of a decent defender he

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
with how much of a decent defender he
was<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:42.030> didn't<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.390> caught<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
was like he didn't get caught out the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230

by<00:03:37.500> look<00:03:37.799> today<00:03:37.980> when<00:03:38.849> I<00:03:38.879> planned<00:03:39.389> on<00:03:39.599> selling

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
by look today when I planned on selling

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.199 
by look today when I planned on selling
mine<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.980> about<00:03:41.750> 390<00:03:42.750> now<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
mine is about 390 now with all the

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.789 
mine is about 390 now with all the
100,000<00:03:45.209> queen<00:03:45.359> facts<00:03:45.690> which<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.049> pretty<00:03:46.560> good

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
100,000 queen facts which is pretty good

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.629 
100,000 queen facts which is pretty good
actually<00:03:46.949> so<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.480> an<00:03:48.599> example<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:49.609> why<00:03:50.609> I

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
actually so this is an example of why I

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.640 
actually so this is an example of why I
liked<00:03:51.180> having<00:03:51.480> Balotelli<00:03:52.079> eight<00:03:52.169> counties<00:03:52.500> in

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
liked having Balotelli eight counties in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.409 
liked having Balotelli eight counties in
a<00:03:52.709> good<00:03:52.859> position<00:03:52.949> and<00:03:53.370> then<00:03:53.819> using<00:03:54.030> his

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
a good position and then using his

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.330 
a good position and then using his
dribbling<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.109> can<00:03:55.319> just<00:03:55.500> cut<00:03:55.709> back<00:03:55.739> inside<00:03:56.159> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
dribbling I can just cut back inside and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
dribbling I can just cut back inside and
finish<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.180> ball<00:03:57.389> into<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.959> back<00:03:58.139> around

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
finish the ball into the back around

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.689 
finish the ball into the back around
that's<00:03:58.680> ridiculous<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.340> won't<00:03:59.459> be<00:03:59.519> able<00:03:59.579> to

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
that's ridiculous you won't be able to

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.030 
that's ridiculous you won't be able to
do<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.909> really<00:04:00.150> if<00:04:00.510> he<00:04:01.319> was<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.650> stryker

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
do that really if he was at stryker

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.129 
do that really if he was at stryker
because<00:04:02.459> he<00:04:02.609> was<00:04:02.730> kind<00:04:02.909> of<00:04:03.000> off<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> side

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
because he was kind of off to the side

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.259 
because he was kind of off to the side
so<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.379> think<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.709> was<00:04:04.889> very<00:04:05.819> very<00:04:06.030> wealthy

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
so I think it was very very wealthy

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.539 
so I think it was very very wealthy
Aries<00:04:06.780> passing<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.590> searches<00:04:08.129> finishing

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
Aries passing and searches finishing

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.460 
Aries passing and searches finishing
their<00:04:08.790> that's<00:04:09.510> perfect<00:04:10.079> like<00:04:10.229> that<00:04:10.260> is

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
their that's perfect like that is

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.969 
their that's perfect like that is
absolutely<00:04:11.370> awesome<00:04:11.699> but<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.780> had<00:04:13.709> trouble

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
absolutely awesome but I had trouble

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.060 
absolutely awesome but I had trouble
with<00:04:14.250> his<00:04:14.400> team<00:04:14.669> I<00:04:14.849> don't<00:04:15.419> know<00:04:15.659> why<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.169> it

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
with his team I don't know why like it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.550 
with his team I don't know why like it
was<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.609> strange<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.269> defense<00:04:18.690> was<00:04:18.930> really

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
was so strange the defense was really

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.529 
was so strange the defense was really
good<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.250> don't<00:04:20.940> know<00:04:21.000> if<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.209> was<00:04:21.359> perhaps

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
good I don't know if I was perhaps

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.120 
good I don't know if I was perhaps
playing<00:04:21.900> poorly<00:04:22.200> but<00:04:22.409> it<00:04:22.469> seems<00:04:22.770> like<00:04:22.889> my

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
playing poorly but it seems like my

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.740 
playing poorly but it seems like my
opponent<00:04:23.490> was<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:23.760> doing<00:04:24.030> everything<00:04:24.240> right

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
opponent was just doing everything right

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.580 
opponent was just doing everything right
now<00:04:24.810> maybe<00:04:25.050> they<00:04:25.229> were<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:25.380> kind<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.680> like

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
now maybe they were just kind of like

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.080 
now maybe they were just kind of like
really<00:04:27.010> well<00:04:27.130> because<00:04:27.310> they<00:04:27.580> saw<00:04:27.820> i<00:04:27.850> had<00:04:27.970> a

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
really well because they saw i had a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.760 
really well because they saw i had a
legend<00:04:28.419> cut<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.660> know<00:04:28.720> either<00:04:28.990> personally<00:04:29.590> like

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
legend cut I know either personally like

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.340 
legend cut I know either personally like
I'll<00:04:30.130> play<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.639> lot<00:04:30.910> better<00:04:31.150> if<00:04:31.750> they've<00:04:32.080> got<00:04:32.320> a

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
I'll play a lot better if they've got a

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.080 
I'll play a lot better if they've got a
ridiculous<00:04:33.010> things<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.370> maybe<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.699> but

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
ridiculous things that maybe is that but

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.290 
ridiculous things that maybe is that but
have<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.020> know<00:04:35.169> some<00:04:35.919> things<00:04:35.949> I<00:04:36.610> thought<00:04:37.030> would

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
have to know some things I thought would

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.890 
have to know some things I thought would
go<00:04:37.540> in<00:04:37.710> sometimes<00:04:38.710> didn't<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:40.180> wasn't<00:04:40.510> as

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
go in sometimes didn't and it wasn't as

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.040 
go in sometimes didn't and it wasn't as
good<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.410> team<00:04:41.770> as<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.100> thought<00:04:42.580> on<00:04:42.790> paper<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.510> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
good a team as I thought on paper so the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.439 
good a team as I thought on paper so the
three<00:04:44.410> striker<00:04:44.830> set<00:04:45.130> up<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.550> think<00:04:46.090> that's<00:04:46.270> what

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
three striker set up I think that's what

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.420 
three striker set up I think that's what
kind<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.930> saved<00:04:47.260> this<00:04:47.500> team<00:04:47.800> for<00:04:47.979> me<00:04:48.070> because

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
kind of saved this team for me because

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.060 
kind of saved this team for me because
we<00:04:48.850> had<00:04:48.970> so<00:04:49.210> many<00:04:49.500> attacking<00:04:50.500> players<00:04:50.770> it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
we had so many attacking players it

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.090 
we had so many attacking players it
actually<00:04:51.280> worked<00:04:51.820> in<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.449> end<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.199> if<00:04:53.949> we

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
actually worked in the end and if we

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.560 
actually worked in the end and if we
didn't<00:04:54.430> have<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.790> say<00:04:54.970> if<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.120> had<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.330> normal

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
didn't have that say if I had a normal

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.360 
didn't have that say if I had a normal
Center<00:04:56.020> attack<00:04:56.229> a<00:04:56.260> mid<00:04:56.470> there<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.830> think<00:04:57.280> this

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
Center attack a mid there I think this

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.100 
Center attack a mid there I think this
team<00:04:57.550> would<00:04:57.699> have<00:04:57.760> been<00:04:57.940> an<00:04:58.120> absolute<00:04:58.750> blob

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
team would have been an absolute blob

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.390 
team would have been an absolute blob
that's<00:04:59.290> a<00:04:59.380> pretty<00:04:59.800> nice<00:04:59.979> had<00:05:00.130> an<00:05:00.220> unfortunate

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
that's a pretty nice had an unfortunate

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.070 
that's a pretty nice had an unfortunate
doesn't<00:05:00.790> go<00:05:00.850> in<00:05:00.970> we<00:05:01.450> get<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.660> rebound<00:05:01.960> though

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
doesn't go in we get the rebound though

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.260 
doesn't go in we get the rebound though
but<00:05:02.320> like<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.620> was<00:05:02.680> saying<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:03.610> strike<00:05:03.940> is<00:05:04.120> set

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
but like I was saying the strike is set

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.570 
but like I was saying the strike is set
up<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.600> worked<00:05:04.870> very<00:05:05.440> very<00:05:05.620> well<00:05:05.919> be<00:05:06.130> frieri

up it worked very very well be frieri
