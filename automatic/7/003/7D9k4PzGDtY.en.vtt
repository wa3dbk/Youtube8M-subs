00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.890
 are hundreds of cages in which they are born and 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.550
 these exotic birds grow ever 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.770
 many years ago they were the dream of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.900
 César Tomás and this singular entrepreneur 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.990
 a different story that today they 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:39.300
 we count on doers in action 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.300
 since I was always a boy 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.430
 my passion what 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.700
 if it takes or is always take it as 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 a game you lived 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.600
 and I had birds out there that are means 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.600
 forbidden that were native 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.220
 more for the singing and all that go 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.680
 and then I was annexing what is everything 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.960
 what is the bone nursery 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 I started with our parrots 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.370
 Australian turrets had them in cage 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.510
 little girl 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.780
 the reproduced dresses 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.790
 and canaries that is 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.300
 and now in these Canarian moments 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.970
 I have but I'm here 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.160
 but he said the confederations that is the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.700
 peace and the Argentine association of each 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.010
 farmers here in parana and fire 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.020
 that the Argentine ornithological federation 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.409
 that there they long for aero baigorria in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.859
 rosary beads 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.039
 the brown birds that are dedicated to 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:47.549
 hatch with care the eggs of 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:51.560
 diamonds from oceania mainly 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.149
 Australians are the mottled mandarins 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.819
 vicens of stars finch and bibs 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.060
 different subspecies that Caesar has in 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.640
 this particular place 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.700
 now what I dedicate the most to the birds 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.700
 that are called exotic or non-native 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.530
 I have everything legal I can take out guides all 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.530
 to dispatch and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.620
 At this moment I have more than 300 cages 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.620
 what are the joined hands that is called 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.000
 Isabella and you are from Japan Acre peaks 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.129
 silver or cauliflower originating 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.500
 from Asia the pin are beheaded African 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:50.220
 they complement the project of this one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.220
 Entrerriano ornithologist good I started 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.930
 for some they had known men 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.620
 in holy faith that was dedicated to creating 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.750
 mandarin diamonds caulk as birds 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.670
 more common and good he more or less me 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.680
 he kicked off to start with 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.310
 the kid that was teaching me that all the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.270
 method, I handle the issue of the transfer of 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.180
 egg to the malones 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.370
 and good after with other acquaintances who 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.870
 I had in rosario that I have a rosary that 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.860
 they are more dedicated to lowering a bit 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.910
 little bit more and a more expensive value and 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.600
 I started with what are called the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.600
 google diamonds 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.540
 now I have google diamond I have the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.580
 bavetta diamond I have mottled the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.570
 stars field 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.270
 when reading there are other varieties the peaks 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.780
 critical frost and silver and there are many 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.550
 species that I have that I am creating and 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.590
 everything is reproduced and raised with wet nurses 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.480
 that is I all I use everything 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.690
 are the grays are we go attention the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.310
 minors 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.580
 Armed cited are what the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.580
 eggs 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.700
 walker there is no road is made way 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.600
 when walking ' the poetry of Antonio Machado 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.610
 fully reflects the day to day of Caesar 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.030
 every day thousands of birds 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.510
 multicolored wait for the attention of this 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.739
 passionate man for his singular 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.739
 life Proyect 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.500
 has to start early easy is not 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:32.040
 well there are now many people who have come 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.690
 he wants to learn that as he was told 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.460
 I do not have any problem in teaching 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.480
 the issue is that you need a lot of care 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.300
 It is a lot of work, that is, it is not that 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.820
 and something easy apart are bugs and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.970
 they are very delicate for that reason for example 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.060
 to reproduce it usually prepare a 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:58.139
 a pasture called a pasture 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.110
 hard egg base and 5 social textile 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.300
 and I know added a food 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.090
 balanced that is bought in santa fe 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.560
 he says that egg-based also everything 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.810
 that goes to the processor it becomes a 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.090
 pastón and every morning early 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.139
 you have to put it on the boards 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.539
 individual the pastor is the task is 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.469
 everyday and demands a presence 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:25.860
 permanent but the prospects are 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:29.009
 good the demand for these colorful and 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.050
 happy birds is incessant and the 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.940
 market does not stop expanding 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.289
 I already tell you I was working more or 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.599
 less with 100 cages until last year 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.990
 good because of the great demand that 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.869
 print the first fear of mine was how 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.379
 sell it or I knew I had 100 now 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:52.900
 I will create a thousand birds as I sell it and 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.090
 taking daily notices 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.400
 and you cards 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.340
 and good and then thanks to the internet 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.639
 now I have a demand from the whole country 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.220
 it was completed I said I take out guides in 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.770
 cages here in parana in resources 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.870
 natural and I send everywhere I already have 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.180
 client at Mar del Plata in Córdoba 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.540
 currents in missions 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.230
 good in Buenos Aires with more reason 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.500
 the world of these birds is small 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.140
 but not the dreams of the entrepreneur who 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.330
 continues betting on growth with 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.120
 new exotic species 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.860
 and has incorporated some or a saint 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.189
 I said I have for example peaks of the acre 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.639
 and good and yellow face profile suit 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:44.349
 if they are foreigners from Uruguay and 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.740
 I have some pigeons now this year 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:50.889
 that those are new are also for me 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.430
 bring the diamond parsons which is another 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:57.340
 variety and the diamond parrot that that 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.110
 I bring them in Brazil that are namely the 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.070
 theme of that are a little bit more 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.810
 complicated to play it and 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.730
 or the price 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.370
 a game of that is about a thousand 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.710
 pesos a couple 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.520
 out there on that side also out there a 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.520
 a little expensive 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.590
 for some the twittering of the birds 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:31.370
 can be deafening for this 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:35.389
 Maker the trills are music in their 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:38.539
 ears and the fullest expression of 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:41.240
 growth of this project that was a 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:44.419
 game in childhood but that today is a 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:48.370
 dream that is concrete with a lot of present 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:48.370
 and with more future
