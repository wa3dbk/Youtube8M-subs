00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.979
 dry width 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 this is to make a salsita that the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.810

 garlic clove and apart we occupy potatoes 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 chopped into small squares 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.490
 we consume the consumption of pepper chicken and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.279

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.870
 It is also made of ostrich and little 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 royal and that's already what's good 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.780
 So we started with the right thing 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.510
 join first put chili is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.999
 to soak in water a cooking area that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 soften and then since it 's in water 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.040
 about 15 minutes in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.940
 water that is soft liquefies with the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.970
 onion and with the garlic 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.270
 that is fried in a pan with little 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.540
 oil with pepper is the salt and the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.050
 consomme and here is the chile and I will 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.850
 know how to prepare the angels right now 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.850
 good and then once we have already 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.430
 the salsita and the way we 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.220
 just indicated olivia we proceed to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.870
 to do what things we fry the potatoes 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.670
 also a little oil we fry them 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.640
 very good since there are the potatoes 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.950
 we add the meat also we put it to 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.770
 Cook a little fry and add the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.090
 chile until we are already meat 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.850
 sad together with the potatoes we add 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.150
 this watched the salsita and we're going 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.130
 doing although olivia yes very well and 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.530
 here is how it comes out and this is all 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.020
 perfect here is the picadillo with 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.840
 the chips and the chili is good 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.110
 ready here what are you going to do now let's go 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.810
 to do with a small tortilla 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.210
 is that then the picadillo is already 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.130
 good clear friends is that good for the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.700
 time that we have here then really 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.690
 we take out here another one more recipe 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.910
 to olivia 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.170
 the arena is already done that really 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.660
 good is the idea to make a picadillo 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.520
 the traditional picadillo is no longer a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.370
 Once you have this, now we are going to 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.900
 proceed to see how we do is a 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.900
 empanada normal list is an omelet 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.490
 then to these areas it's up to 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.250
 first the ball and in the turn 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.550

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.780

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.909
 Ostrich stage is good ostrich 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.190
