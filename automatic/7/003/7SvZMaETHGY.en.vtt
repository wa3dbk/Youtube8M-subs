00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
family guide American data still
comparing<00:01:34.740> Cleveland<00:01:35.070> Show<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> those<00:01:35.759> two

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
comparing Cleveland Show to those two

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
comparing Cleveland Show to those two
saying<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> oh<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.110> replica<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
saying that oh it's just a replica that

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.149 
saying that oh it's just a replica that
thing<00:01:38.250> oh<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.420> people<00:01:39.780> who<00:01:40.009> like<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
thing oh I think people who like the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219 
thing oh I think people who like the
shows<00:01:41.369> or<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.240> generally<00:01:42.810> don't<00:01:42.990> make

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
shows or you know generally don't make

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
shows or you know generally don't make
that<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> assumption<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.520> they

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that kind of assumption they just they

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.399 
that kind of assumption they just they
gravitate<00:01:45.540> towards<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> ones<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.229> like

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
gravitate towards the ones they like

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.740 
gravitate towards the ones they like
yeah<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.490> yeah<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.880> each<00:01:48.240> show<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
yeah but yeah I think each show is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
yeah but yeah I think each show is
individual<00:01:49.290> family<00:01:49.619> guy's<00:01:49.770> got<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> much

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
individual family guy's got a much

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.700 
individual family guy's got a much
harder<00:01:50.549> take<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.149> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> things<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
harder take a lot of things like that

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.690 
harder take a lot of things like that
time<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.250> interviewed<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> other

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
time that we interviewed the other

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.679 
time that we interviewed the other
person<00:01:54.149> yes<00:01:55.820> do<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:57.119> awful<00:01:57.479> thing<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
person yes do an awful thing that

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.719 
person yes do an awful thing that
happened<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.890> The<00:01:58.979> Cleveland<00:01:59.310> Show<00:01:59.340> tries<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
happened and The Cleveland Show tries to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.140 
happened and The Cleveland Show tries to
be<00:01:59.850> more<00:01:59.880> family-oriented

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
be more family-oriented

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.940 
be more family-oriented
and<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:01.780> think<00:02:01.990> there's<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.380> little<00:02:02.590> bit<00:02:02.710> of

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and I think there's a little bit of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.250 
and I think there's a little bit of
general<00:02:03.940> feel<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.120> politics<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.930> different

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
general feel of politics and a different

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.560 
general feel of politics and a different
comedy<00:02:05.890> sense<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.280> American<00:02:06.670> Dad<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.060> they<00:02:07.450> all

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
comedy sense to American Dad so they all

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.999 
comedy sense to American Dad so they all
try<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.780> live<00:02:07.960> independently<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:08.680> it's<00:02:08.830> yeah

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
try to live independently but it's yeah

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.350 
try to live independently but it's yeah
it's<00:02:09.220> impossible<00:02:09.340> not<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.820> compare<00:02:10.180> them

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
it's impossible not to compare them

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.660 
it's impossible not to compare them
definitely<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.260> I'm<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.280> one<00:02:12.430> final

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
definitely and I'm just just one final

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.510 
definitely and I'm just just one final
wrap-up<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.710> your<00:02:14.710> time<00:02:14.920> working<00:02:15.130> with<00:02:15.250> Seth

like Seth MacFarlane writing or

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.560 
like Seth MacFarlane writing or
animating<00:02:24.700> or<00:02:24.790> something<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
animating or something like that would I

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.230 
animating or something like that would I
give<00:02:25.780> them<00:02:25.990> like<00:02:26.230> some<00:02:26.980> advice<00:02:27.130> if<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.180> want

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
to work with Seth

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.240 
to work with Seth
yeah<00:02:29.730> wow<00:02:30.730> that's<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.210> tough<00:02:31.420> question<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:32.410> would

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
yeah wow that's a tough question I would

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.860 
yeah wow that's a tough question I would
I<00:02:33.430> would<00:02:33.670> say<00:02:35.670> impress<00:02:36.670> him<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.180> some<00:02:37.510> form<00:02:37.810> of

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
I would say impress him in some form of

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.990 
I would say impress him in some form of
media<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.290> gets<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.830> him<00:02:38.950> okay<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.640> think<00:02:39.850> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
media that gets to him okay I think that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.390 
media that gets to him okay I think that
would<00:02:40.150> be<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.840> good<00:02:40.990> way<00:02:41.170> he's<00:02:41.620> yeah<00:02:41.950> he's<00:02:42.340> very

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
would be a good way he's yeah he's very

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.860 
would be a good way he's yeah he's very
knowledgeable<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.120> keeps<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.690> what's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
knowledgeable and keeps up with what's

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.930 
knowledgeable and keeps up with what's
going<00:02:44.110> on<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.680> think<00:02:45.310> he<00:02:45.430> gravitates

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
going on and I think he gravitates

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.580 
going on and I think he gravitates
towards<00:02:46.330> woody<00:02:46.540> what<00:02:46.780> he<00:02:46.870> finds<00:02:47.080> funny<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
towards woody what he finds funny and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.580 
towards woody what he finds funny and
and<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.550> if<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.150> produce<00:02:49.330> stuff<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.870> he<00:02:49.990> sees

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
and so if you produce stuff and he sees

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.680 
and so if you produce stuff and he sees
it<00:02:50.740> likes<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.160> he<00:02:51.280> tends<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.270> get<00:02:52.390> involved

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
it likes it he tends to get involved

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.880 
it likes it he tends to get involved
with<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.870> yeah<00:02:53.020> so<00:02:53.170> definitely<00:02:53.290> keep<00:02:53.590> up<00:02:53.740> with

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
with it yeah so definitely keep up with

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.740 
with it yeah so definitely keep up with
the<00:02:53.980> times<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> media<00:02:54.640> yeah<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:55.510> right

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
