00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.609
 angelo of cold coffee normally 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
 show the mill a very elaborate 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.370
 cause you complete them 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.990
 must disassemble course 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 scary annoying when you look at it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.190
 knows but there are of course 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.529
 other ways how we clean the whole 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 Can with what you can do that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.369
 I'll tell you here in this little one 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.400
 short video and that we work with 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.289
 poly together with the product pÃºblico 1 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 and how easy that is from the 17th 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.570
 now use here as before 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 discussed polygram granules too 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 to answer 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.610
 and let's just do it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 see the Belgian could be made blank 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.000
 but also according to the accordingly 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.690
 just after the last ballot and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.890
 employed simply as a house 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:53.120
 fill in the pack all here 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.120
 just a 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:06.049
 that's all slipped well down into 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.729
 waiting 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.229
 You can do all this without the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.689
 Use of the brand setting 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.299
 Incidentally, also suitable for fully automatic machines 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.130
 Taking my warning applies only 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.049
 this product with fully automatic the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.070
 a bridge was removable 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.840
 Background is easy if times 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.360
 the pores should clog the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.750
 group then it becomes for example 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 a law device very exciting so now 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.590
 we have so far now time yes 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 because it can through 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.320
 and I push on the house 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.760
 so after everything has come out now 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.990
 Let's just take one again 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:15.540
 decent amount of coffee is coming now 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:21.690
 remaining cases like here a carrier 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:27.300
 a bit edgy there are situations where name 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.810
 this is enough all just yet 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.810
 through times 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.849
 that 's it so far already endeavors is now 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.569
 quick and easy to use again 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.090
 complicated 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.469
 and because without changing the market 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.870
 Of course, star is very important because 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.639
 All other products require one 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.700
 compelling move in the middle 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:10.870
 until upper times range here omitted 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.510
 this is due to the fine granule art 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 solves the tastings of fat and 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.769
 oils and brings fresh again 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.689
 wind in your mill that was pure from 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.969

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.450
