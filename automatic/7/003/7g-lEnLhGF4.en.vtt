real<00:05:11.300> this<00:05:11.510> is<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.750> think<00:05:13.000> 6.42<00:05:14.000> one<00:05:14.740> gear<00:05:15.740> ratio

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
real this is I think 6.42 one gear ratio

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.670 
real this is I think 6.42 one gear ratio
pretty<00:05:17.630> slow<00:05:18.350> but<00:05:19.310> still<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.960> not<00:05:21.320> really

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
pretty slow but still it's not really

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.029 
pretty slow but still it's not really
used<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.100> burn<00:05:22.370> burnin<00:05:23.380> things<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.590> just<00:05:24.740> use<00:05:24.889> it

for<00:05:25.070> crank<00:05:25.460> baits<00:05:25.760> i<00:05:26.120> like<00:05:26.419> i<00:05:27.070> like<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.370> a

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
for crank baits i like i like the a

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.940 
for crank baits i like i like the a
little<00:05:29.240> bit<00:05:29.360> faster<00:05:29.510> than<00:05:29.930> five<00:05:30.320> point<00:05:30.620> four

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
little bit faster than five point four

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.909 
little bit faster than five point four
to<00:05:31.160> one<00:05:31.430> because<00:05:32.210> i<00:05:32.720> could<00:05:33.169> either<00:05:33.289> burn<00:05:33.740> it

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
to one because i could either burn it

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.610 
to one because i could either burn it
really<00:05:34.160> fast<00:05:34.370> if<00:05:34.700> i<00:05:34.820> want<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.300> or<00:05:35.720> i<00:05:35.780> could

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
really fast if i want it to or i could

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.370 
really fast if i want it to or i could
just<00:05:36.770> slow<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.250> down<00:05:37.430> even<00:05:37.940> more<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:39.050> get<00:05:39.200> that

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
just slow it down even more to get that

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.150 
just slow it down even more to get that
nice<00:05:39.590> wobble<00:05:40.750> this<00:05:41.750> doesn't<00:05:42.080> have<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.919> one

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
nice wobble this doesn't have the one

nice wobble this doesn't have the one
through<00:05:43.430> ten<00:05:44.320> magnetic<00:05:45.320> brakes<00:05:46.180> but<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:48.169> has

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
through ten magnetic brakes but it has

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:55.180 
through ten magnetic brakes but it has
the<00:05:48.950> star<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:51.610> tension<00:05:52.610> up<00:05:53.830> really<00:05:54.830> smooth

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
the star and tension up really smooth

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.420 
the star and tension up really smooth
real<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.789> really<00:05:56.330> smooth<00:05:58.090> so<00:05:59.500> yeah<00:06:00.500> that's

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
real to really smooth so yeah that's

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.000
