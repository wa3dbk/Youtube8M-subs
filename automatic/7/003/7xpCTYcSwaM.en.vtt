one<00:00:12.870> inch<00:00:13.080> by<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.530> inch<00:00:13.559> angle<00:00:14.190> iron<00:00:14.929> and<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
one inch by one inch angle iron and I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.910 
one inch by one inch angle iron and I
doubled<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:20.750> one<00:00:21.750> set<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.170> rectangular<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.800> go

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
