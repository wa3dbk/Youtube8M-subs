00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.190
 do you know that comes the most visible 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.120
 before arriving at your home by toulouse 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.920
 a next trip look with the crisis the way of the double blow of its origin 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.920
 until he returns to the wild 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.119
 we know all the sons of the country 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.979
 he does not necessarily know more in the atmosphere 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:36.129
 the action of cold protein the trend the clouds september and the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.129
 birth to precipitation 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.160
 much of this water evaporates 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.080
 the rest joined the streams he is mayor how many are they very very 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.469
 slowly in the ground 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.360
 to feed the underground natural reservoir 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 called the end 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.300
 the water you drink it is taken several meters deep at 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.750
 drilling assistance 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.050
 these captures cardinal to darnÃ©tal the oldest work of 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.420
 the agglomeration the first work of erdf 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.720
 from the beginning of the 16th century 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.050
 in prayer there are about thirty carthage and pump stations 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.160
 once pompey the orchestrated left to become total 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.140
 this one never has 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.240
 it's a very modern hellner chemical process it's used 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.490
 ultra membrane filtration 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.490
 diouf to settle through a cellulose membrane pierced with holes 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.270
 even smaller than the effort of the break 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.900
 it is rid of all its impurities while preserving the salts 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 minerals essential to your health 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.210
 ultimate precaution essential not presenting any danger the chlorine 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.780
 c02 afp a drama of glory what is poured into the thousand liters of water 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 the equivalent of a game in this sense that blacks 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 his role 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 to ensure the elimination of the viruses he debated 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 the rest is then stored in a water tower and a reservoir 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.929
 the creg proposed a health 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.899
 each structure allows an elevation necessary for distribution finally the 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.979
 more modest 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.409
 note that to lead to the houses through voting pipes 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.089
 these two food products 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.619
 the Directorate of Health Affairs 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:32.729
 and social perform levies across the entire network at the division in 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.639
 accredited laboratories the critt also constantly control by the 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.999
 created 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.999
 its richness in mineral salts must free the sick 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.439
 essential for your health 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.189
 but while you use and its list 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.029
 two sanitary maintenance missions 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.169
 fava his return to the natural environment 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.479
 the water must be cleaned 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.159
 it then goes back into the sanitation pipes to a station 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.569
 of purification like that of the aquatic 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.709
 it is his loan of 3000 km of sanitation network 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.449
 small course our territory 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.219
 exemplary in terms of the environment 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.419
 this station incorporates the most advanced technologies in terms of 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.629
 cleanup 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.829
 a recovery is cleaned up in crusade 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.999
 first the physical pre-treatment 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.009
 the opa is through grids that retain the most waste 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.039
 bulky 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.379
 it is also rid of sands and gravels 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.079
 are deposited at the bottom of the basins beto greece 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.529
 it goes up thanks to an injection of air they are collected on the surface 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.209
 then the primary treatment eliminated 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.909
 the subjects too 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.439
 small shadow suspension at the bottom of the basin 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.399
 these are the real primary 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.709
 last step the biological treatment of bacteria naturally 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.910
 present in the back 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.830
 eliminated 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.130
 organic pollution like phosphates nitrates and carbon at 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.640
 beginning of the generic to separate from the water by settling in basins 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.250
 called clarifier 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.100
 the primary and biological 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.260
 they are incinerated value them 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 building materials 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.590
 albeit rid of its impurities europe is not drinking 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.410
 purified which complies with European standards for protection 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.860
 of the environment 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.719
 she rejects the scene 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.999
 the rest is pollution will be eliminated by the bacteria that 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.860
 naturally present in the natural environment 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.979
 under the effect of the heat of the sun 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.499
 launched the fear of us 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.309
 and the cycle starts again
