hi<00:00:04.420> this<00:00:04.690> is<00:00:04.720> jason<00:00:05.020> Odell<00:00:05.470> with<00:00:05.740> another

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:05.980 
hi this is jason Odell with another

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.879 
hi this is jason Odell with another
capture<00:00:06.399> nx2<00:00:06.790> tip<00:00:07.440> today<00:00:08.440> I'm<00:00:08.590> going<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.740> talk

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
capture nx2 tip today I'm going to talk

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.620 
capture nx2 tip today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:09.040> versions<00:00:09.880> and<00:00:10.059> I<00:00:10.150> think<00:00:10.330> this<00:00:10.420> is<00:00:10.599> a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.630 
about versions and I think this is a

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.990 
about versions and I think this is a
very<00:00:10.870> underutilized<00:00:11.410> feature<00:00:11.950> of<00:00:12.250> capture<00:00:12.640> NX

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
very underutilized feature of capture NX

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.939 
very underutilized feature of capture NX
and<00:00:13.240> it's<00:00:14.110> one<00:00:14.320> that<00:00:14.470> is<00:00:15.119> really<00:00:16.119> conducive<00:00:16.449> to

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and it's one that is really conducive to

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.350 
and it's one that is really conducive to
work<00:00:17.949> flow<00:00:18.220> because<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:18.699> allows<00:00:18.910> you<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.180> save

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
work flow because it allows you to save

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.660 
work flow because it allows you to save
multiple<00:00:19.720> variants<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.530> your<00:00:20.710> same<00:00:20.980> image<00:00:21.400> all

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
multiple variants of your same image all

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.529 
multiple variants of your same image all
within<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.480> same<00:00:22.770> neff<00:00:23.770> file<00:00:24.070> and<00:00:24.340> so<00:00:25.330> this

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
within the same neff file and so this

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.960 
within the same neff file and so this
works<00:00:25.810> if<00:00:26.050> you<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:27.130> can<00:00:27.250> use<00:00:27.369> versions<00:00:27.820> with

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
works if you you can use versions with

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.390 
works if you you can use versions with
your<00:00:28.150> neph<00:00:28.330> files<00:00:28.570> or<00:00:28.869> if<00:00:29.590> you're<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.830> JPEG

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
your neph files or if you're a JPEG

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.639 
your neph files or if you're a JPEG
shooter<00:00:30.699> you<00:00:30.940> can<00:00:31.150> save<00:00:31.449> your<00:00:31.600> JPEG<00:00:31.840> as<00:00:32.289> an<00:00:32.439> F

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
shooter you can save your JPEG as an F

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.790 
shooter you can save your JPEG as an F
and<00:00:33.460> then<00:00:34.000> create<00:00:34.449> versions<00:00:34.930> so<00:00:35.409> here's<00:00:35.649> an

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
and then create versions so here's an

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.009 
and then create versions so here's an
image<00:00:35.949> on<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.579> screen<00:00:36.699> that<00:00:37.600> I've<00:00:37.839> already

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
image on the screen that I've already

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.879 
image on the screen that I've already
gone<00:00:38.260> through<00:00:38.289> and<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.449> processed<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.889> at

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:41.889 
gone through and and processed and at

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.770 
gone through and and processed and at
this<00:00:42.069> point<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.550> my<00:00:42.579> workflow<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:43.569> about

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
this point in my workflow this is about

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.989 
this point in my workflow this is about
where<00:00:44.019> I<00:00:44.050> would<00:00:44.350> decide<00:00:44.649> that<00:00:44.889> I<00:00:44.920> pretty<00:00:45.550> happy

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
where I would decide that I pretty happy

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:48.270 
where I would decide that I pretty happy
with<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.179> way<00:00:46.389> the<00:00:46.539> image<00:00:46.809> looks<00:00:46.839> I<00:00:47.350> haven't

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
with the way the image looks I haven't

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.860 
with the way the image looks I haven't
cropped<00:00:48.639> it<00:00:48.850> or<00:00:48.969> resize<00:00:49.389> that<00:00:49.600> or<00:00:49.749> done

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
cropped it or resize that or done

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.000 
cropped it or resize that or done
anything<00:00:50.019> like<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.589> is<00:00:50.649> pretty<00:00:50.920> much

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
anything like that this is pretty much

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.209 
anything like that this is pretty much
my<00:00:51.159> master<00:00:51.940> image<00:00:52.299> and<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.469> at<00:00:53.739> this<00:00:53.949> point

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
my master image and so at this point

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.739 
my master image and so at this point
what<00:00:54.429> I<00:00:54.459> want<00:00:54.699> to<00:00:54.789> do<00:00:54.969> is<00:00:54.999> create<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.539> new

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
what I want to do is create a new

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.360 
what I want to do is create a new
version<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:59.260> do<00:00:59.319> that<00:00:59.589> by<00:00:59.739> clicking<00:00:59.769> on<00:01:00.249> the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
version and I do that by clicking on the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.129 
version and I do that by clicking on the
version<00:01:00.579> menu<00:01:00.999> at<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.179> top<00:01:01.389> of<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.690> Edit<00:01:01.929> list

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.139 
version menu at the top of the Edit list

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:03.840 
version menu at the top of the Edit list
and<00:01:02.409> then<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:02.799> get<00:01:02.889> this<00:01:03.069> dialog<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:03.549> says

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and then you get this dialog that says

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.330 
and then you get this dialog that says
new<00:01:04.030> version<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:04.659> usually<00:01:05.350> my<00:01:05.560> master

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
new version and usually my master

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.130 
new version and usually my master
version<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.790> something<00:01:07.090> that<00:01:07.180> I<00:01:07.240> call<00:01:07.540> master

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
version is something that I call master

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980 
version is something that I call master
so<00:01:08.380> I'll<00:01:08.500> type<00:01:08.790> master<00:01:09.790> into<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.510> field<00:01:10.780> and

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
so I'll type master into the field and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.850 
so I'll type master into the field and
click<00:01:11.620> OK<00:01:12.040> at<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:13.420> point<00:01:13.720> if<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.290> save<00:01:14.650> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
click OK at this point if I save the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.460 
click OK at this point if I save the
file<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.570> master<00:01:16.570> version<00:01:16.870> is<00:01:17.170> something

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
file that master version is something

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.170 
file that master version is something
that<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:17.830> always<00:01:18.010> revert<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.550> so<00:01:18.940> if<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.150> go

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
that I can always revert to so if I go

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.330 
that I can always revert to so if I go
back<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.780> versions<00:01:20.200> list<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:21.130> see

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
back to the versions list you see

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.940 
back to the versions list you see
there's<00:01:21.580> master<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:23.500> thing<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.770> have<00:01:23.890> to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
there's master one thing you have to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.530 
there's master one thing you have to
remember<00:01:24.070> about<00:01:24.490> versions<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.360> any

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
remember about versions is that any

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.170 
remember about versions is that any
changes<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.050> make<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.490> file<00:01:27.790> in<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
changes I make to the to the file in the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.150 
changes I make to the to the file in the
Edit<00:01:28.450> list<00:01:28.690> either<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.770> developed

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
Edit list either in the developed

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880 
Edit list either in the developed
section<00:01:30.550> or<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.700> adjust<00:01:31.180> section<00:01:31.680> won't<00:01:32.680> be

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
section or the adjust section won't be

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.470 
section or the adjust section won't be
added<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.520> current<00:01:33.970> version<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.450> version

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
added to the current version the version

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.270 
added to the current version the version
you<00:01:34.840> can<00:01:35.020> think<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.410> as<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.530> snapshot<00:01:35.980> in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
you can think of it as a snapshot in

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.490 
you can think of it as a snapshot in
time<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.730> when<00:01:37.510> you<00:01:37.660> made<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.260> always

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
time of when you made it so you always

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.770 
time of when you made it so you always
want<00:01:38.620> to<00:01:38.770> make<00:01:38.890> versions<00:01:39.430> as<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.210> last<00:01:40.510> thing

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
want to make versions as the last thing

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.570 
want to make versions as the last thing
you<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:41.080> when<00:01:41.290> you're<00:01:41.440> pretty<00:01:41.650> satisfied<00:01:42.250> with

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
you do when you're pretty satisfied with

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.820 
you do when you're pretty satisfied with
with<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> way<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.300> image<00:01:43.570> turns<00:01:43.780> out<00:01:43.990> now

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
with the way the image turns out now

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.550 
with the way the image turns out now
let's<00:01:45.130> say<00:01:45.340> for<00:01:45.670> example<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:46.990> wanted<00:01:47.440> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
let's say for example that I wanted to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.160 
let's say for example that I wanted to
make<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> crop<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.520> image<00:01:48.850> into<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.570> into<00:01:50.020> a

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
make a crop of this image into a into a

make a crop of this image into a into a
portrait<00:01:50.950> orientation<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.690> could<00:01:53.110> use<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
portrait orientation so I could use the

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.420 
portrait orientation so I could use the
crop<00:01:53.620> tool<00:01:55.650> apply<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.710> crop<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:59.310> maybe<00:02:00.310> I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
crop tool apply the crop and maybe I

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.940 
crop tool apply the crop and maybe I
want<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.790> resize<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:04.380> four<00:02:05.380> by<00:02:05.560> six

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
want to resize this to be a four by six

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.440 
want to resize this to be a four by six
so<00:02:06.940> i'll<00:02:07.090> go<00:02:07.330> ahead<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.930> i<00:02:08.769> will<00:02:08.950> make<00:02:09.159> it<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.550> 4

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
so i'll go ahead and i will make it a 4

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.849 
so i'll go ahead and i will make it a 4

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
around on your computer because if you

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.140 
around on your computer because if you
think<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.160> alternative<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:15.940> made<00:03:16.120> a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
think of the alternative if I made a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.960 
think of the alternative if I made a
separate<00:03:16.650> jpg<00:03:17.650> or<00:03:17.920> separate<00:03:18.310> neff<00:03:18.490> file<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
separate jpg or separate neff file you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.960 
separate jpg or separate neff file you
and<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:19.270> each<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.540> these<00:03:19.630> images<00:03:20.080> I'd<00:03:20.410> quickly

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and for each of these images I'd quickly

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.390 
and for each of these images I'd quickly
be<00:03:21.970> running<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> hard<00:03:23.200> drive<00:03:23.350> space<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.250> this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
be running on a hard drive space so this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.890 
be running on a hard drive space so this
is<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> great<00:03:24.790> little<00:03:24.820> tip<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.450> think<00:03:25.780> it's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
is a great little tip I think it's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.130 
is a great little tip I think it's
something<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.320> use<00:03:26.530> all<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.739> time<00:03:26.890> and

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
something that I use all the time and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.080 
something that I use all the time and
it's<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.260> good<00:03:29.410> thing<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.709> know<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.130> if<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.940> got
