are going to need for this is some oak
logs<00:00:29.720> oak<00:00:30.720> planks<00:00:31.759> white<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:33.800> oak<00:00:34.800> stairs

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
logs oak planks white will oak stairs

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.619 
logs oak planks white will oak stairs
and<00:00:36.200> some<00:00:37.200> oak<00:00:37.440> slabs<00:00:38.149> now<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and some oak slabs now we want to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
and some oak slabs now we want to
connect<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.140> wall<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> tower<00:00:41.489> here

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
connect this wall up to this tower here

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389 
connect this wall up to this tower here
so<00:00:42.390> i<00:00:42.420> always<00:00:42.690> simply<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.920> start

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so i always simply have to do is start

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
so i always simply have to do is start
on<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.239> side<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.500> corner<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
on this right side here in the corner of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.180 
on this right side here in the corner of
these<00:00:47.399> two<00:00:48.300> stairs<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.020> we'll<00:00:49.739> place<00:00:49.920> two

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
these two stairs here we'll place two

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.029 
these two stairs here we'll place two
logs<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.360> leave<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> space<00:00:52.469> create

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
logs down like that leave a space create

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
logs down like that leave a space create
another<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.480> exactly<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> same<00:00:55.110> for

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
another to do this exactly the same for

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
another to do this exactly the same for
the<00:00:55.440> other<00:00:55.590> side<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.039> start<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:56.760> two

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the other side so start in these two

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.319 
the other side so start in these two
corners<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:58.460> two<00:00:59.460> logs<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.910> leave<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
corners here two logs like that leave a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
corners here two logs like that leave a
space<00:01:00.629> another<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.649> should<00:01:01.859> look

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
space another two and it should look

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000 
space another two and it should look
like<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.280> across<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:04.110> between<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> logs

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
like a across here in between the logs

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
like a across here in between the logs
place<00:01:05.430> some<00:01:06.360> stairs<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.790> top<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
place some stairs like that on top of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.700 
place some stairs like that on top of
these<00:01:09.150> logs<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.560> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
these logs here what we want to do is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
these logs here what we want to do is
place<00:01:10.950> stairs<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:12.060> each<00:01:12.180> other<00:01:12.420> like

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.470 

now<00:01:24.830> on<00:01:25.010> top<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.490> these<00:01:25.640> stairs<00:01:25.940> what<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:26.300> need

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
now on top of these stairs what we need

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.930 
now on top of these stairs what we need
to<00:01:26.570> do<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:26.930> place<00:01:27.230> these<00:01:27.500> logs<00:01:28.160> again<00:01:28.370> so<00:01:28.820> you

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
to do is place these logs again so you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.880 
to do is place these logs again so you
also<00:01:29.270> really<00:01:29.480> have<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.690> do<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.930> jump<00:01:30.350> up<00:01:30.530> place
