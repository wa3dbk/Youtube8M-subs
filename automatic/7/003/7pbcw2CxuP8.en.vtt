00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
of the rest of the worktop area so the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.590 
of the rest of the worktop area so the
first<00:00:51.230> thing<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.440> need<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.620> do<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:52.600> depending

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
first thing you need to do is depending

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.780 
first thing you need to do is depending
on<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.780> severity<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.559> scratch<00:00:54.829> which<00:00:55.550> you

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
on the severity of the scratch which you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.780 
on the severity of the scratch which you
can<00:00:55.969> determine<00:00:56.239> really<00:00:57.610> just<00:00:58.610> with<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
can determine really just with the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.069 
can determine really just with the
fingernail<00:00:59.210> if<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.570> can<00:00:59.750> get<00:00:59.960> your

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
fingernail if you can get your

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.940 
fingernail if you can get your
fingernail<00:01:00.790> into<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:02.090> scratch<00:01:02.360> then<00:01:03.230> you'll

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
fingernail into the scratch then you'll

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.150 
fingernail into the scratch then you'll
need<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.250> start<00:01:04.580> really<00:01:04.759> with<00:01:04.910> a<00:01:04.970> 120<00:01:05.750> grit

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
need to start really with a 120 grit

need to start really with a 120 grit
this<00:01:07.160> is<00:01:07.250> quite<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:08.170> strong<00:01:09.170> sandpaper<00:01:09.710> stone

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.430 
this is quite a strong sandpaper stone
you<00:01:10.310> need<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.550> be<00:01:10.640> very<00:01:10.789> careful<00:01:11.300> not<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.899> over

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.639 
sand this area and what I mean by over
sanding<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:15.920> let<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.180> some<00:01:18.170> people<00:01:18.319> do<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
sanding is let the some people do the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.590 
sanding is let the some people do the
work<00:01:18.800> you<00:01:19.069> don't<00:01:19.280> need<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.550> apply<00:01:19.819> extra

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
work you don't need to apply extra

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.590 
work you don't need to apply extra
pressure<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.229> sander<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:22.479> certainly<00:01:23.479> do

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
pressure to the sander and certainly do

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.350 
pressure to the sander and certainly do
not<00:01:23.810> tip<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.170> sander<00:01:24.590> onto<00:01:25.490> an<00:01:25.610> edge<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:26.060> sort

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
not tip the sander onto an edge to sort

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.580 
not tip the sander onto an edge to sort
of<00:01:26.420> get<00:01:26.569> a<00:01:26.600> bit<00:01:26.810> more<00:01:26.929> purchase<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
of get a bit more purchase on the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.199 
of get a bit more purchase on the
scratch<00:01:27.830> because<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.369> will<00:01:28.520> actually<00:01:28.940> end<00:01:29.090> up

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
scratch because you will actually end up

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.109 
scratch because you will actually end up
with<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.390> dip<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.050> worktop<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.970> what

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
with a dip and the worktop and so what

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.969 
with a dip and the worktop and so what
you<00:01:32.240> want<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.509> do<00:01:32.599> is<00:01:32.720> take<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:32.929> square<00:01:33.380> area

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
you want to do is take a square area

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.089 
you want to do is take a square area
square<00:01:34.310> or<00:01:34.490> rectangular<00:01:34.970> area<00:01:35.920> around<00:01:36.920> about

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.099 
square or rectangular area around about

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.660 
square or rectangular area around about
10<00:01:37.490> centimetres<00:01:38.209> larger<00:01:38.810> than<00:01:38.959> scratch<00:01:39.349> and

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
10 centimetres larger than scratch and

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.719 
10 centimetres larger than scratch and
all<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.759> way<00:01:40.849> around<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.270> work<00:01:41.959> in<00:01:42.319> a<00:01:42.979> motion

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
all the way around and work in a motion

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.020 
all the way around and work in a motion
which<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:44.810> down<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.200> left<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.770> right

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
which is up and down and left to right

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.639 
which is up and down and left to right
over<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.209> over<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.720> scratched<00:01:48.170> area<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.840> next

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
over the over the scratched area so next

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.740 
over the over the scratched area so next
you'll<00:01:51.770> move<00:01:51.920> on<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.250> 180<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:53.390> 180

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
you'll move on to the 180 the 180

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.669 
you'll move on to the 180 the 180
basically<00:01:54.709> just<00:01:55.250> removes<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.849> sanding<00:01:56.209> marks

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
basically just removes the sanding marks

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.469 
basically just removes the sanding marks
they<00:01:57.679> were<00:01:57.800> put<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.130> by<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.369> 120<00:01:59.119> grit<00:01:59.149> and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
they were put in by the 120 grit and

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.760 
they were put in by the 120 grit and
you'll<00:01:59.630> see<00:01:59.840> these<00:01:59.989> they're<00:02:00.259> almost<00:02:00.410> sort<00:02:00.709> of

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
you'll see these they're almost sort of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.830 
you'll see these they're almost sort of
small<00:02:02.050> semicircular<00:02:04.270> Minter<00:02:05.270> scratches<00:02:05.690> if

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
small semicircular Minter scratches if

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.229 
small semicircular Minter scratches if
you<00:02:05.929> like<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.349> that<00:02:06.709> 180<00:02:07.039> would<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:07.970> remove

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
you like and that 180 would just remove

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.900 
you like and that 180 would just remove
these<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.170> idea<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.770> sand<00:02:10.220> an<00:02:10.459> area

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
these and the idea is to sand an area

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.910 
these and the idea is to sand an area
that's<00:02:11.420> slightly<00:02:11.750> larger<00:02:12.319> than<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.530> area

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that's slightly larger than the area

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.680 
that's slightly larger than the area
that<00:02:13.040> you've<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.400> sanded<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.360> are<00:02:14.540> sort

that you've just sanded so you are sort
of<00:02:14.720> sanding<00:02:15.080> into<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.130> rest<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
of sanding into the the rest of the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.440 
of sanding into the the rest of the
worktop<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.040> again<00:02:19.040> nice<00:02:19.400> even<00:02:19.849> pressure<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
worktop and again nice even pressure you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.530 
worktop and again nice even pressure you
don't<00:02:20.660> need<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.739> sort<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.980> lean<00:02:22.939> or<00:02:23.329> put

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
don't need to it to sort of lean or put

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.880 
don't need to it to sort of lean or put
any<00:02:23.689> heavy<00:02:23.900> pressure<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.439> sander<00:02:24.799> because

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
any heavy pressure on the sander because

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.709 
any heavy pressure on the sander because
that<00:02:25.219> will<00:02:25.370> again<00:02:25.579> just<00:02:25.879> sort<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.180> put<00:02:26.420> marks

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
that will again just sort of put marks

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.020 
that will again just sort of put marks
into<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.200> worktop

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
into the worktop

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.340 
into the worktop
the<00:02:28.120> idea<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.660> want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.900> bring<00:02:29.140> out

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
the idea is that you want to bring out

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.800 
the idea is that you want to bring out
the<00:02:29.950> marks<00:02:30.280> from<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> previous<00:02:31.030> sanding<00:02:31.510> so

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the marks from the previous sanding so

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.610 
the marks from the previous sanding so
the<00:02:32.170> 180<00:02:32.530> will<00:02:32.800> definitely<00:02:33.220> do<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:34.620> before

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the 180 will definitely do that before

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.000 
the 180 will definitely do that before
you're<00:02:35.920> ready<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.190> move<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> 220<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you're ready to move on to the 220 the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.559 
you're ready to move on to the 220 the
220<00:02:39.550> exactly<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.390> same<00:02:40.630> as<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.440> 180<00:02:41.770> repeat

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
220 exactly the same as the 180 repeat

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.570 
220 exactly the same as the 180 repeat
basically<00:02:43.569> exactly<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.260> same<00:02:44.430> motion<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
basically exactly the same motion the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.430 
basically exactly the same motion the
left-to-right<00:02:45.910> up<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.510> down<00:02:46.660> over<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.080> area

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
left-to-right up and down over the area

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.199 
left-to-right up and down over the area
again<00:02:47.770> you're<00:02:48.310> going<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.489> send<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.790> slightly

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
again you're going to send a slightly

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.930 
again you're going to send a slightly
larger<00:02:49.510> area<00:02:50.110> than<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.860> did<00:02:51.069> with<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.520> 180

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
larger area than you did with the 180

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.320 
larger area than you did with the 180
grit<00:02:52.239> paper<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.730> will<00:02:55.060> bring

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
grit paper and this really will bring

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.360 
grit paper and this really will bring
you<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.630> what<00:02:55.900> would<00:02:55.989> be<00:02:56.170> pretty<00:02:57.100> much<00:02:57.250> an

you to what would be pretty much an

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.440 
you to what would be pretty much an
industry-standard<00:02:57.819> matte<00:02:58.390> finish<00:03:00.450> however

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
industry-standard matte finish however

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720 
industry-standard matte finish however
the<00:03:01.930> rest<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.560> work<00:03:02.709> tops<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.130> might<00:03:03.400> find

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
the rest of the work tops you might find

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.550 
the rest of the work tops you might find
have<00:03:03.910> been<00:03:04.090> finished<00:03:04.450> off<00:03:04.570> with<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.230> green

have been finished off with a green
scotch-brite<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.700> will<00:03:06.880> take<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
scotch-brite and that will take it to a

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.900 
scotch-brite and that will take it to a
matte<00:03:09.280> sort<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.959> semi-gloss<00:03:10.959> matte<00:03:11.380> finish

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
just to finish off we would recommend

again<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.590> do<00:03:23.709> this<00:03:23.830> with<00:03:24.040> sand<00:03:24.370> with<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
again to do this with sand with the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.729 
again to do this with sand with the
sander<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.330> most<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.319> them<00:03:26.410> have<00:03:26.560> velcro

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
sander and most of them have velcro

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.979 
sander and most of them have velcro
bottoms<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.910> stick<00:03:28.269> the

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
bottoms so you can stick the

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.680 
bottoms so you can stick the
scotch-brite<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.310> bottom<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.819> then<00:03:31.450> with

scotch-brite to the bottom and then with

scotch-brite to the bottom and then with
some<00:03:32.260> water<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:32.829> damp<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.430> area<00:03:33.790> that

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
top that where the scratch was just so

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.110 
top that where the scratch was just so
you<00:03:44.769> can<00:03:44.860> get<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.010> nice<00:03:45.250> even<00:03:45.610> finish<00:03:45.700> all<00:03:46.000> the

then<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> best<00:03:50.860> thing<00:03:51.040> would<00:03:51.130> be<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.459> give<00:03:51.579> us

then the best thing would be to give us

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.930 
then the best thing would be to give us
a<00:03:51.730> call<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.380> we<00:03:53.380> can<00:03:53.500> come<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:53.980> read
