00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
when you're on it you're going to want

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.920 
when you're on it you're going to want
to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.260> holding<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:53.239> well<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.660> me<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to be holding be well for me it's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
to be holding be well for me it's
because<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.469> put<00:00:55.620> bumper<00:00:55.890> jumper<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
because I put bumper jumper but if you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
because I put bumper jumper but if you
play<00:00:56.670> default<00:00:57.120> it'll<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:57.960> bumper<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
play default it'll be right bumper so

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.540 
play default it'll be right bumper so
just<00:00:59.430> hold<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.780> boarding<00:01:01.320> button<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> crouch

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
just hold the boarding button and crouch

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.899 
just hold the boarding button and crouch
so<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.600> doesn't<00:01:03.930> say<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:05.460> takes<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> few

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
so it doesn't say it and it takes a few

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
so it doesn't say it and it takes a few
tries<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> messed<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
tries like right here I messed up but I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
tries like right here I messed up but I
was<00:01:08.369> holding<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.299> worked<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
was holding be so would have worked if I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
was holding be so would have worked if I
got<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.680> my<00:01:10.799> teammate<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.250> charged
