there
and<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:10.569> figured<00:04:11.080> something<00:04:11.800> about<00:04:12.330> snapping

and I figured something about snapping
our<00:04:13.540> side<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> road<00:04:14.110> would<00:04:14.530> be

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
our side of the road would be

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.050 
our side of the road would be
appropriate<00:04:15.160> so<00:04:15.370> haven't<00:04:15.610> done<00:04:15.760> one<00:04:15.910> of<00:04:15.940> those

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
appropriate so haven't done one of those

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.969 
appropriate so haven't done one of those
