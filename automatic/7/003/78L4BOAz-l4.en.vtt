00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
impressed and I decided I must have just

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.039 
impressed and I decided I must have just
missed<00:00:10.519> something<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.120> game<00:00:12.300> some<00:00:12.630> or

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
missed something in the game some or

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.140 
missed something in the game some or
that<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> game<00:00:14.130> had<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.370> offer<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.940> went

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that the game had to offer so I went

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.820 
that the game had to offer so I went
back<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.750> flew<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.260> mission<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
back and I flew the first mission a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
back and I flew the first mission a
friend<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.699> mine<00:00:17.880> went<00:00:18.090> finding<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> was

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
friend of mine went finding out I was

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260 
friend of mine went finding out I was
playing<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> game<00:00:19.890> said<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.789> always<00:00:21.090> knew<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
playing the game said they always knew I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.080 
playing the game said they always knew I
was<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> Cylon<00:00:22.250> that<00:00:23.250> got<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.670> thinking<00:00:23.820> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
was a Cylon that got me thinking that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.480 
was a Cylon that got me thinking that
maybe<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.600> needed<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.230> fly<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.619> mission<00:00:26.099> from

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
maybe I needed to fly this mission from

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.060 
maybe I needed to fly this mission from
both<00:00:26.880> perspectives<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> Cylon<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.830> human

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
both perspectives as a Cylon and a human

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150 
both perspectives as a Cylon and a human
the<00:00:29.760> missions<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.570> nearly<00:00:31.260> identical<00:00:31.380> they

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the missions are nearly identical they

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.100 
the missions are nearly identical they
really<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.030> only<00:00:33.149> difference<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.899> them

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
really are the only difference in them

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
really are the only difference in them
is<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.620> chose<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> slower<00:00:35.370> Cylon<00:00:35.880> fighter<00:00:36.180> which

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
is I chose a slower Cylon fighter which

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810 
is I chose a slower Cylon fighter which
turns<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.739> such<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.129> idea<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
turns out to be not such a good idea and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.119 
turns out to be not such a good idea and
you'll<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.300> why<00:00:39.450> later<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.899> you're<00:00:40.739> prompted

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you'll see why later on you're prompted

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.900 
you'll see why later on you're prompted
through<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.239> whole<00:00:42.480> way<00:00:42.890> with<00:00:43.890> text<00:00:44.340> prompts

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
through the whole way with text prompts

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.590 
through the whole way with text prompts
and<00:00:45.890> your<00:00:46.890> mission<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:47.850> first<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and your mission is to go out first to a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.729 
and your mission is to go out first to a
wrecked<00:00:49.020> ship<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.610> retrieve<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.940> Salvage

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
wrecked ship and retrieve some Salvage

wrecked ship and retrieve some Salvage
this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> great<00:00:53.160> chance<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.550> learn<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.510> fly

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this is a great chance to learn to fly

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
this is a great chance to learn to fly
your<00:00:54.870> ship<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:56.480> investigate<00:00:58.070> whatever<00:00:59.070> the

buttons do check your maps in general
just<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.350> float<00:01:04.350> around<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
just kind of float around and get the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.969 
just kind of float around and get the
feel<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.070> everything<00:01:05.750> when<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
feel for everything when I got to the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.480 
feel for everything when I got to the
wreck<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> human<00:01:09.900> mission<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.490> noticed

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
wreck on the human mission I noticed

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
wreck on the human mission I noticed
that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> music<00:01:12.420> has<00:01:12.570> started<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.049> pick<00:01:13.229> up

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that the music has started to pick up

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.640 
that the music has started to pick up
and<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.340> had<00:01:14.520> started<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.650> become

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and really had started to become

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460 
and really had started to become
peaceful<00:01:17.430> music<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.390> something<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
peaceful music and something that I

very<00:01:21.869> nice<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> spent<00:01:23.460> part<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.210> out

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
very nice so I spent part of my time out

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.070 
very nice so I spent part of my time out
amongst<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.280> wreck<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.880> flying<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
amongst this wreck just flying and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.810 
amongst this wreck just flying and
listening<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> music<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.500> switched<00:01:32.460> from

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
listening to the music I switched from

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.420 
listening to the music I switched from
key<00:01:33.299> control<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.049> mouse<00:01:34.200> control<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.310> my

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
key control to mouse control for my

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.780 
key control to mouse control for my
flight<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.110> huge

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
flight and it was just a huge

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.260 
flight and it was just a huge
improvement<00:01:39.860> smoother<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:41.400> exact<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
improvement smoother more exact on the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.260 
improvement smoother more exact on the
controls<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.259> made<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> whole<00:01:44.490> experience<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
controls it made the whole experience of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.139 
controls it made the whole experience of
flying<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.110> much<00:01:46.259> nicer<00:01:46.530> than<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.520> had<00:01:47.939> been

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
flying so much nicer than it had been

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.560 
flying so much nicer than it had been
with<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> keys<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
with the keys now as I go around the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.390 
with the keys now as I go around the
ship<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:52.110> enjoying<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.189> view

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
ship I'm enjoying the view

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:04.530 
ship I'm enjoying the view
of<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.760> planet<00:01:55.330> it's<00:01:55.570> just<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:57.040> pretty

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.830 

and<00:02:04.960> as<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.260> can<00:02:05.410> see<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:06.130> controls<00:02:06.640> are<00:02:07.630> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
and as you can see the controls are so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.290 
and as you can see the controls are so
much<00:02:08.050> smoother<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.160> much<00:02:09.340> more<00:02:09.550> exact<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.180> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
much smoother so much more exact on the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.420 
much smoother so much more exact on the

just<00:02:13.420> amazing<00:02:13.930> amount<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.349> improvement<00:02:14.879> by

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
just amazing amount of improvement by

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.680 
just amazing amount of improvement by
going<00:02:16.359> to<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.930> mouse<00:02:17.109> versus<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.829> keys
