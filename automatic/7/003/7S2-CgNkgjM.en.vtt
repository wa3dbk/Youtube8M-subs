there<00:00:39.530> have<00:00:39.710> been<00:00:39.890> some<00:00:40.100> nuances<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.790> some

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
there have been some nuances and some

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.479 
there have been some nuances and some
improvements<00:00:41.840> in<00:00:41.960> set-top<00:00:42.489> antenna

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
improvements in set-top antenna

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.459 
improvements in set-top antenna
technology<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.690> we'll<00:00:44.809> talk<00:00:44.989> about<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:45.290> a

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
technology and we'll talk about that a

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.130 
technology and we'll talk about that a
little<00:00:45.710> bit<00:00:46.840> basically<00:00:47.840> there<00:00:48.050> are<00:00:48.079> two

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
little bit basically there are two

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.770 
little bit basically there are two
different<00:00:48.710> types<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.250> antennas<00:00:49.789> there<00:00:50.510> are

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
different types of antennas there are

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.229 
different types of antennas there are
your<00:00:51.020> rabbit<00:00:51.440> ears<00:00:51.699> antennas<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.730> you're

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
your rabbit ears antennas that you're

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.450 
your rabbit ears antennas that you're
probably<00:00:53.539> very<00:00:53.750> familiar<00:00:54.260> with<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.949> these

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
probably very familiar with and these

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.020 
probably very familiar with and these
antennas<00:00:56.170> usually<00:00:57.170> have<00:00:57.440> both<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.219> UHF<00:00:58.879> and

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
antennas usually have both the UHF and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.959 
antennas usually have both the UHF and
VHF<00:00:59.800> capability<00:01:00.800> we'll<00:01:01.340> talk<00:01:01.579> about<00:01:01.730> that

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
VHF capability we'll talk about that

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.359 
VHF capability we'll talk about that
antenna<00:01:02.359> first<00:01:02.750> then<00:01:03.530> later<00:01:03.770> on<00:01:03.859> we're<00:01:04.339> going

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
antenna first then later on we're going

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.930 
antenna first then later on we're going
to<00:01:04.580> talk<00:01:04.820> about<00:01:05.080> UHF<00:01:06.080> only<00:01:06.619> antennas<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:07.850> the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
to talk about UHF only antennas now the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.300 
to talk about UHF only antennas now the
latter<00:01:08.270> we're<00:01:08.750> encouraging<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:09.619> not<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.130> use

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
latter we're encouraging you not to use

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.839 
latter we're encouraging you not to use
in<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> Greater<00:01:10.820> Cincinnati<00:01:11.060> area<00:01:11.830> because

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:12.849 
in the Greater Cincinnati area because

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.609 
in the Greater Cincinnati area because
here<00:01:13.849> in<00:01:14.060> Cincinnati<00:01:14.690> there<00:01:14.959> will<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.319> two

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
here in Cincinnati there will be two

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.249 
here in Cincinnati there will be two
digital<00:01:16.160> channels<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:17.209> will<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.630> still<00:01:18.050> be

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
digital channels that will be still be

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.490 
digital channels that will be still be
in<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.009> VHF<00:01:19.610> BAM<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.509> really<00:01:20.959> do<00:01:21.110> need<00:01:21.349> an

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
in the VHF BAM so you really do need an

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.070 
in the VHF BAM so you really do need an
antenna<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.099> can<00:01:22.250> receive<00:01:22.580> both<00:01:22.880> UHF<00:01:23.869> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
antenna that can receive both UHF and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.390 
antenna that can receive both UHF and
the<00:01:24.560> VHF

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.210 

so<00:01:28.910> let's<00:01:29.120> talk<00:01:29.390> about<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.990> VHF<00:01:30.500> uhf<00:01:31.070> antenna

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
so let's talk about the VHF uhf antenna

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.010 
so let's talk about the VHF uhf antenna
or<00:01:31.730> rabbit<00:01:32.150> ears<00:01:32.330> I'm<00:01:32.570> sure<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.870> remember

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
or rabbit ears I'm sure you remember

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.020 
or rabbit ears I'm sure you remember
from<00:01:33.560> your<00:01:33.740> mom's<00:01:33.920> television<00:01:34.610> set<00:01:34.820> or

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
from your mom's television set or

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.910 
from your mom's television set or
perhaps<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:35.960> still<00:01:36.230> have<00:01:36.470> one<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.830> these

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
perhaps you still have one of these

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.830 
perhaps you still have one of these
antennas<00:01:37.520> on<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> set<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.270> basement<00:01:38.720> or

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
antennas on the set in the basement or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.080 
antennas on the set in the basement or
in<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.020> bedroom<00:01:39.380> usually<00:01:40.280> consists<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.850> two

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
in the bedroom usually consists of two

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.840 
in the bedroom usually consists of two
long<00:01:41.390> metal<00:01:41.690> rods<00:01:41.990> that's<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.040> VHF<00:01:43.640> antenna

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
long metal rods that's the VHF antenna

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.690 
long metal rods that's the VHF antenna
and<00:01:44.540> then<00:01:45.110> normally<00:01:45.650> there<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:45.980> round<00:01:46.310> disc

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
and then normally there is a round disc

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.140 
and then normally there is a round disc
or<00:01:47.060> around<00:01:47.360> wire<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.080> that<00:01:48.620> is<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.150> uhf

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
or around wire and that is the uhf

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.810 
or around wire and that is the uhf
antenna<00:01:50.590> these<00:01:51.590> antennas<00:01:52.070> are<00:01:52.190> very<00:01:52.340> popular

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
antenna these antennas are very popular

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.910 
antenna these antennas are very popular
because<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.210> again<00:01:53.570> they<00:01:53.840> get<00:01:54.050> both<00:01:54.260> channels

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
because of again they get both channels

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.460 
because of again they get both channels
on<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.340> UHF<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:55.970> VHF<00:01:56.060> bands<00:01:56.990> they're

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
on the UHF and VHF bands they're

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.770 
on the UHF and VHF bands they're
inexpensive<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.460> they<00:01:59.090> are<00:01:59.150> widely

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
inexpensive and they are widely

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.420 
inexpensive and they are widely
available<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.560> can<00:02:00.710> get<00:02:00.890> them<00:02:01.040> at<00:02:01.160> most

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
available you can get them at most

digital broadcasting we should discuss
UHF<00:02:15.740> only<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.250> tennis<00:02:16.610> as<00:02:16.760> well<00:02:17.000> however

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
UHF only in tennis as well however

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.390 
UHF only in tennis as well however
they're<00:02:17.990> not<00:02:18.110> recommended<00:02:18.709> for<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.190> Greater

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
they're not recommended for the Greater

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.449 
they're not recommended for the Greater
Cincinnati<00:02:19.580> area<00:02:20.060> since<00:02:20.690> they<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.410> UHF<00:02:22.100> only

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
Cincinnati area since they are UHF only

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.430 
Cincinnati area since they are UHF only
they're<00:02:22.940> highly<00:02:23.240> directional<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:24.080> very<00:02:24.380> very

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
they're highly directional but very very

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.400 
they're highly directional but very very
sensitive<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.490> UHF<00:02:25.940> signals<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.260> if

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
sensitive to the UHF signals so if

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.949 
sensitive to the UHF signals so if
you're<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:28.010> fringe<00:02:28.280> area<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.480> may<00:02:29.630> want<00:02:29.900> to

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
you're in a fringe area you may want to

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.430 
you're in a fringe area you may want to
purchase<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.620> however<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.580> should<00:02:31.790> remember

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
purchase one however you should remember

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.560 
purchase one however you should remember
that<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.620> only<00:02:33.860> gets<00:02:34.190> UHF<00:02:34.700> channels<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:35.390> will

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
that it only gets UHF channels it will

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.290 
that it only gets UHF channels it will
be<00:02:35.690> hard<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.230> channel<00:02:36.560> 9<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.670> for<00:02:38.060> fringe

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
be hard to get channel 9 but for fringe

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.830 
be hard to get channel 9 but for fringe
areas<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.900> will<00:02:39.140> be<00:02:39.260> great<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:41.239> that's<00:02:41.390> kind<00:02:41.720> of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
areas it will be great so that's kind of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.890 
areas it will be great so that's kind of
a<00:02:41.930> primer<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.700> set-top<00:02:43.700> antennas<00:02:44.540> these<00:02:44.750> are
