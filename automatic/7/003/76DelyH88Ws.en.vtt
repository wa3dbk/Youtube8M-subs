had<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.000> bleach<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.540> time<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.259> usually<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
had to bleach it one time and usually I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.469 
had to bleach it one time and usually I
don't<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.430> having<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.759> bleach<00:02:03.060> hair<00:02:03.240> over

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
don't like having to bleach hair over

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.550 
don't like having to bleach hair over
and<00:02:03.509> over<00:02:03.689> again<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.200> does<00:02:04.350> damage

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and over again because it does damage

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.990 
and over again because it does damage
the<00:02:04.860> hair<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.280> makes<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> lot<00:02:05.759> weaker

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the hair and it makes it a lot weaker

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.570 
the hair and it makes it a lot weaker
when<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
when you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.999 
when you
for<00:02:06.910> California<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.780> color<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.680> quite

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
for California and color is quite

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.550 
for California and color is quite
harmful<00:02:09.400> to<00:02:09.820> hair<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> didn't<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.500> to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
harmful to hair so I didn't want to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.530 
harmful to hair so I didn't want to
bleach<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.860> too<00:02:12.280> harsh<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.880> then<00:02:13.120> ends<00:02:13.450> up

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
bleach it too harsh and then ends up

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.770 
bleach it too harsh and then ends up
have<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.930> 20<00:02:14.260> inch<00:02:14.470> hair<00:02:14.950> once<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.150> was<00:02:16.360> done<00:02:16.570> with

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
have a 20 inch hair once I was done with

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750 
have a 20 inch hair once I was done with
the<00:02:16.900> color<00:02:17.110> process<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.890> was<00:02:18.100> happy<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.460> wear

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the color process so I was happy to wear

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.220 
the color process so I was happy to wear
not<00:02:18.940> bleached<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.450> should<00:02:19.630> say<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
not bleached it I should say and the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.490 
not bleached it I should say and the
hair<00:02:20.470> was<00:02:20.950> still<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.730> great<00:02:22.480> condition<00:02:22.690> I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
hair was still in great condition I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.650 
hair was still in great condition I
bleached<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.460> once<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> hair<00:02:25.330> went

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
bleached it once and the hair went

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.690 
bleached it once and the hair went
absolutely<00:02:26.170> some<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.550> two

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
absolutely some of it I think two

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
absolutely some of it I think two
bundles<00:02:27.940> were<00:02:28.870> close<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.350> white<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
bundles were close to white and the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.760 
bundles were close to white and the
other<00:02:30.130> one<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.640> other<00:02:30.730> two<00:02:30.880> were<00:02:31.840> sort<00:02:32.620> of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
other one the other two were sort of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.100 
other one the other two were sort of
honey<00:02:33.370> blonde<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.180> quite<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> light<00:02:34.840> honey

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
honey blonde but quite a light honey

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.200 
honey blonde but quite a light honey
blonde<00:02:35.470> but<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.310> was<00:02:36.460> great<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.790> me<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.060> work

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
blonde but that was great for me to work

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.840 
blonde but that was great for me to work
with<00:02:37.240> anyway<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.530> was<00:02:38.710> happy<00:02:39.040> along<00:02:39.580> with

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
with anyway so I was happy along with

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.390 
with anyway so I was happy along with
that<00:02:40.120> when<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.480> bleached<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.930> closure<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.980> took

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
that when I bleached the closure it took

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.670 
that when I bleached the closure it took
well<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> bleach<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> will<00:02:44.140> say<00:02:44.410> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
well to the bleach but I will say that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.949 
well to the bleach but I will say that
once<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.100> put<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.400> dial<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.880> me<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.390> did<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
once I put the dial on me it did go a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.840 
once I put the dial on me it did go a
little<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.160> looked<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.700> was

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
little bit it looked like it was

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.449 
little bit it looked like it was
slightly<00:02:49.120> fried<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> had<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.920> go<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.250> with

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
slightly fried so I had to go in with

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.910 
slightly fried so I had to go in with
some<00:02:51.490> straighteners<00:02:52.300> just<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.870> sort<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.200> calm

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
some straighteners just a sort of calm

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.250 
some straighteners just a sort of calm
it<00:02:54.100> down<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.340> little<00:02:54.610> bit<00:02:54.970> some<00:02:55.270> hair<00:02:55.480> serum<00:02:55.810> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
it down a little bit some hair serum and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.620 
it down a little bit some hair serum and
then<00:02:56.470> my<00:02:56.709> curling<00:02:57.160> wand<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:58.240> that's<00:02:58.420> what<00:02:58.570> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
then my curling wand so that's what I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.140 
then my curling wand so that's what I
did<00:02:58.720> before<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.410> actually<00:02:59.680> wore<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.430> out<00:03:00.760> just

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
did before I actually wore it out just

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.550 
did before I actually wore it out just
to<00:03:01.270> make<00:03:01.360> sure<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.140> hair<00:03:02.320> wouldn't

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
to make sure that the hair wouldn't

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.370 
to make sure that the hair wouldn't
break<00:03:02.830> off<00:03:03.130> after<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.760> had<00:03:04.090> dyed<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.750> because<00:03:05.110> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
break off after I had dyed it because I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.110 
break off after I had dyed it because I
didn't<00:03:05.650> dose<00:03:05.830> very<00:03:06.100> much<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.910> didn't

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
didn't dose very much of it and I didn't

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.390 
didn't dose very much of it and I didn't
want<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.330> lose<00:03:07.510> what<00:03:07.990> was<00:03:08.260> bleached<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.280> or

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
want to lose what was bleached of it or

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.340 
want to lose what was bleached of it or
what<00:03:09.550> was<00:03:09.700> dyed<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.480> makes<00:03:10.690> any<00:03:11.110> sense

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
what was dyed of it that makes any sense

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.979 
what was dyed of it that makes any sense
so<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.400> made<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.700> hair<00:03:12.850> into<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.150> wig<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.660> I've

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
so I made the hair into a wig and I've

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.140 
so I made the hair into a wig and I've
actually<00:03:14.140> loved<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.739> hair<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:15.370> love<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.970> so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
actually loved the hair I love it so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.970 
actually loved the hair I love it so
much<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:16.690> nice<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.170> soft<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.590> only<00:03:17.769> thing

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
much it's nice and soft the only thing

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.410 
much it's nice and soft the only thing
that<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.160> was<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.459> bit<00:03:18.700> worried<00:03:19.000> about<00:03:19.209> was<00:03:19.390> that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
that I was a bit worried about was that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.540 
that I was a bit worried about was that
the<00:03:19.570> ends<00:03:19.930> were<00:03:20.050> quite<00:03:20.290> thin<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.310> four

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
the ends were quite thin it is four

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.270 
the ends were quite thin it is four
bundles<00:03:21.940> of<00:03:22.030> 24<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.500> can<00:03:23.709> see<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
bundles of 24 but you can see that the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.759 
bundles of 24 but you can see that the
ends<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:25.000> not<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.530> four

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
ends of that is not that much for four

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.170 
ends of that is not that much for four
bundles<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.550> of<00:03:28.450> 24<00:03:29.110> inches<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.860> did<00:03:30.459> expect<00:03:30.910> it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
bundles of of 24 inches I did expect it

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.180 
bundles of of 24 inches I did expect it
to<00:03:31.420> kind<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.720> be<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.930> lot<00:03:32.230> more<00:03:32.410> thicker<00:03:32.800> at<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
to kind of be a lot more thicker at the
