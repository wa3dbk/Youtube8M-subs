00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.490
 there are no words to call the spectacular sport you see this will be 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.329
 the case of colored bombs to save her 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.960
 let's wait until there actually the teacher's seat is a crucial moment 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.519
 was the password so that we can apply to the positions the members to 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.099
 breaking a world record is the Brazilian agency 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 there too 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.190
 best in the area the world record 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 the united states have for whomever they want to join but there were laws of physics 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.670
 this logic 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 castro odds 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.020
 this one hundred maluku the two are brazilians 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.100
 elmer is back to review for the first time the pictures count a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 Bit better, how was the story? 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.420
 the interesting detail here paulo just came in the last hour this 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.740
 that's what we had 120 pre-selected skydivers for the straight 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.439
 I like this group is a support group but I ended up taking part in the course 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.410
 prof 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.340
 the experience weighed 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.570
 it is not of today that he participates in these aerial adventures other four reactors 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
 will also talk 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.450
 over 60 years 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.109
 I do not think he uses 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.979
 the full lineup looks like a diamond but could currently be called paper 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.010
 our case a more serious complication 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.720
 here we feel happy 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.270
 several times talking 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 so even on the ground we had trouble understanding 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.740
 but at the time of the jump 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 the publication is made in three years 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.550
 and with a little goodwill quite committed truth 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.810
 everything happened 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.299
 and it is not just with the markets 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.130
 care for Brazil 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.410
 so the dream team of others 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.219
 the men serious risks 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.809
 during every Friday net 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.339
 incidents happen 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.799
 we are prepared to minimize the risks 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.779
 but we know the fever 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.880
 sometimes it does not give you another chance 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.999
 terrible accident that ended 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.459
 the body was recovered 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.489
 a colleague of ours is the driver 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.419
 he just passed away 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 as a result after two days 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.479
 clause 7 goals 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:41.099
 here the day starts early for the team are three rehearsals the first before six 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.289
 morning five airplanes a lot of people involved the long trainings 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.289
 tiring 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:48.479
 and it looked like it was not going to work out 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.990
 after four attempts the group was 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.509
 david believes in this possibility I will do the same without being challenged 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.509
 by Friday must participate in the only attempt 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.209
 if we can 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 the couple said 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.799
 The moment we want to win, 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.499
 was breathing deep any formation of the year 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.499
 and those the eight of these our people 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.789
 the city hall for her courage 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.489
 the lady sees tears 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.059
 He really wants to have to work for me personally to reconquer it. 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.879
 worried the world record 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.259
 mainly a condition of s 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.259
 the case is practically unattainable by 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.379
 after a successful passage 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.029
 we've already been the record even bigger I think it's going to take a long time 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.289
 the people 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.929
 imagine something that can be bigger 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.919
 only that training 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.730
 but they've said it before, nobody does anything 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.729
 the time like this 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.479
 while not starting a new preparation 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.209
 the challenge is literally in the air 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.519
 market source 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.259
 someone gets empowered
