00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.810
 great hello to everyone and today is the first 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.509
 release of my new gear game 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.410
 chronology I think the meaning of the transfer is clear 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.710
 from its name 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.630
 Well, we drove 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.760
 food I will say right away that a new film is not for me 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.950
 liked although 120 rubles for a ticket is not 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.050
 it was not a pity I do not think the film is very 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.180
 bad but he did not become a worthy replacement 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.550
 original robocop oh well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.099
 drove by 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.800
 The first game released was called robocop 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.869
 unexpectedly she really came out just on 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.880
 a bunch of platforms even the game itself was 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.890
 good enough and even allowed 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.930
 find out the height of the weight and name of the weapon 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.269
 Robocop but it was a bunch of bad 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.870
 ports just look at this port 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.730
 on apple 2 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.440
 but at the time it was fashionable to port 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.399
 game for anything and everything that they somehow 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.890
 pull the release date of the game in 1988 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.149
 the game is very standard you play as a slave 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.370
 who comes to the scene 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.469
 crime where you have to deal with 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.729
 bad guys and so you 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.290
 clean the whole city 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.450
 forward 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.610
 the next game was a continuation of the first 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.120
 and called robocop 2 the game became more 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.100
 classic for those times she came out 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.530
 1991 there was no co-op in the game 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 actually it is expected you will be given 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.770
 fight with kane successful drug lord 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.770
 so what are you waiting for 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 and the end of the cop foreman trilogy 2d 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.670
 ends the third part of the game robocop 3 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.020
 released in 1992 released by 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.540
 ocean software 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.549
 versions for commodore amiga atari are and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.710
 I have pis have been released digital 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.780
 imaging design converted to another 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.540
 game engine supporting three-dimensional 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 the version mode for us is typical 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.070
 Platform Shooter The main difference from 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.140
 past games this is what you get damage 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.940
 in a separate part of your body that is 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.100
 if you hit your hand you start 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.810
 have trouble shooting and if 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.940
 hit your leg gets harder 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.100
 walk and the like while going 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.110
 between levels you have the opportunity 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.550
 eliminate these same damage game 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.550
 pretty short only 5 levels 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.960
 the next game became really 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.750
 unexpected and she is very strange in terms of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.530
 the universe how do you cross the universe 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.400
 robocop 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.750
 attention terminator universe following 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.750
 the game is called robocop vs 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.569
 Terminator released in 1992 and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.610
 you know what on fig we need john conor 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.410
 because we now have a robocop which 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.570
 will challenge sky on this and several 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.190
 terminators you play as robocop 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.570
 must on the way deal with all 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.640
 terminators and get to 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.530
 central supercomputer skynet 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.100
 the most important villain of the universe 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.100
 terminator 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.159
 finish dad 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.680
 cap game released 2003 russian 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.689
 version by the way came out in 2004 game 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.760
 full three-dimensional graphics on that 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.069
 the moment in my opinion was acceptable 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.319
 the game was very interesting personally for 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.760
 me you play for robocop and which 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.349
 must kill or arrest 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.329
 criminals while you must 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.680
 keep civilians alive 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.700
 fisherman cop damn you 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 and you must comply with all three directives 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.769
 oh I almost forgot the game of 2014 release 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.689
 for mobile platforms see no point no 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.640
 tell because it is similar to the film and 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.040
 my opinion is not much different from 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.019
 about the 2014 movie 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.909
