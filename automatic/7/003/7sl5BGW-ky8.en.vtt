00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.050
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 tee 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.290
 7 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.540
 It is an interview with everyone in the broadcast seat broadcast seat ancestors 3 times 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.679
 Brilliantly we gained 6 victory of the Muslims let alone t part top Thailand 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.679
 First, I want to eat 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.890
 Today was 6 times to throw 2 goals, but you are looking back on yourself 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:34.309
 It 's strange that I'm standing here honestly 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.309
 I think I could have made a match up to 5 times 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.110
 In your own mind , I think what kind of place was not the best today 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.110
 It is time was not good'll every once wide 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.630
 There was no change ball, so it was not good today 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.020
 Well , I think it's only there because the fielder took a lot of points for me to be bad 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.980
 I will 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.980
 What kind of thing did you throw with the greatest care in saying bad ? 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.590
 Oh dear 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.740
 Well I'd could not quite but I wanted to raise the strike preceding heart 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.740
 I think it was good to be beaten well 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.610
 Even in such a situation, it is now said that it will be the sixth victory to become a god of tape top Thailand 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.780
 How about that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.780
 I'm standing because they asked to sell anymore 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.729
 Now for a tight game 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.729
 I want to try hard to be thrown firmly 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.650
 I think that still remain many without waiting in the first half of the season Well mound of opportunity, but the following is what the place 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 Do you want to fix and put on board 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.020
 I will do my best so that I can completely throw it when I can throw it completely 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.850
 After that we strengthen and eat as a team 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.510
 How is the savings going to be inside? 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.510
 No really 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.800
 I 'm doing in the main 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.890
 I think that it is Tteka it I would like to also do my best from now on as Ikeru riding also myself 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.060
 I will 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.450
 Thank you for expecting next boarding 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.450
 First it was through stop that was given a six-win team top Thailand 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.989
 If it is the end of the year, it is a whistle hero It is a play spiral 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.750
 At first it became one run of 3 run home run 2 games continuation of alternative production bar, but how is it including response 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.110
 Maybe 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.770
 Well response was good 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.300
 You can also hit the ball well 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.800
 Well , I was running while thinking that I could get in 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:44.490
 I thought the third at bat of the previous at-bat Bontai but would be a pipe at the time of any feelings 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.800
 Well , I did not hit in the previous at-bat, so here is 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.310
 I didn't even get out of the band 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.310
 I entered with the feeling that I want to return the runner firmly 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.330
 There are no 11 games here , and it will be a hit for 3 consecutive games since then 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.970
 But 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.970
 How is because commitment against this RBI of Asamura's 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.300
 I can not do it so much 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.870
 Recently than it did not strike at all in the scoring area 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.880
 Well I think today was good 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.970
 Aso everyone after 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:28.670
 I think also expect everyone of it one fan was decided also All-Star players yesterday 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:33.540
 Maybe a lot of people have done Tokyo, but I think there is something 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.490
 That's right I really appreciate those fans 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.790
 Other than me, Mr. Akiyama, Mr. Morinakamura 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.100
 I'm a little sober type but 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.590
 In all 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.170
 With full force 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.230
 I think that I want to do my best 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.720
 Well that all there is still a game though 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:58.310
 After this, any play was decided to win the card, but please for the future 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.020
 That's right I won a row 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.420
 As Santa can do 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:09.080
 I think that I want to do my best I hope you can wait tomorrow 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.610
 That's it for the interview of one of the hero's players 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.240
 First of all 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:19.910
 It seems too strange that the ten turtles stand here 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.430
 I entered from a single word, but still the same reflection as I was willing to pay for the stillbirth 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.400
 I thought I had it I knew it myself 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.400
 I think I can expect the next a
