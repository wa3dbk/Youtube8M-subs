cross-examination is well looking at it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.510 
cross-examination is well looking at it
in<00:00:52.350> hindsight<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> bottom<00:00:53.370> line<00:00:53.399> is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
in hindsight but the bottom line is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
in hindsight but the bottom line is
today<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.270> thought<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> great<00:00:55.110> answer<00:00:55.289> it

today I thought it was a great answer it
was<00:00:55.829> convincing<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:57.149> far<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> abuse

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
was convincing and as far as the abuse

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
was convincing and as far as the abuse
is<00:00:58.109> concerned<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.340> an<00:00:59.460> important

there's tons of corroboration this is a
depth<00:01:15.060> case<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.659> don't<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.200> stuff<00:01:16.259> up

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
depth case they don't make this stuff up

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
depth case they don't make this stuff up
they<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.340> other<00:01:17.580> witnesses<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.390> corroborate

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that John well I disagree what that with

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
that John well I disagree what that with
the<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:21.960> said<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> plausible<00:01:23.280> defense<00:01:23.490> i

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the two said about a plausible defense i

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
the two said about a plausible defense i
mean<00:01:24.060> i<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> end<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> day

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
mean i don't think at the end of the day

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
mean i don't think at the end of the day
when<00:01:25.860> she<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.159> done<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> stand<00:01:26.939> i<00:01:27.119> don't

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
when she is done on the stand i don't

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.539 
when she is done on the stand i don't
think<00:01:27.600> anybody<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> believe<00:01:29.250> her

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
think anybody is going to believe her

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
think anybody is going to believe her
defense<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> sole<00:01:31.049> purpose<00:01:31.500> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
defense I think the sole purpose for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
defense I think the sole purpose for
putting<00:01:31.950> her<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.970> save<00:01:33.270> her<00:01:33.450> life

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
putting her on is to save her life

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
putting her on is to save her life
because<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> jury<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> hard

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
because a jury is going to have a hard

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
because a jury is going to have a hard
time<00:01:36.180> looking<00:01:36.780> her<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> face<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> putting

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
time looking her in the face and putting

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
time looking her in the face and putting
her<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> death<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.390> heard<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.689> her

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
her to death when they heard about her

her to death when they heard about her
bad<00:01:40.290> childhood<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.610> bad<00:01:41.850> relationships

bad childhood and the bad relationships

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
bad childhood and the bad relationships
but<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.979> she's<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
but I don't think that she's going to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.880 
but I don't think that she's going to
have<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> plausible<00:01:45.479> defense<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.380> self-defense

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
have a plausible defense of self-defense

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.090 
have a plausible defense of self-defense

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
by the time she leaves the stand she

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.780 
by the time she leaves the stand she
doesn't<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.750> any<00:01:58.020> credibility<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:59.189> it's

pathological liar but unfortunately or

pathological liar but unfortunately or
fortunately<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.810> she<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
fortunately I think that she is going to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
be believable to the jury that's how I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.640 
be believable to the jury that's how I
think<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.970> gonna<00:02:12.209> play<00:02:12.450> out<00:02:12.540> even<00:02:13.290> though<00:02:13.379> we

think it's gonna play out even though we
may

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
may
