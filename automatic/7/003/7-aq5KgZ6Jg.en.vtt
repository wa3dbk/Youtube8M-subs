 and you just have to go out with me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.690
 that is now 18 cm 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.109
 because the closure measures three centimeters 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.020

 another piece from the chain 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.799

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 210 cm long pieces of cotton or leather 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.899
 wall seconds glue rhodes on the sides 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.579
 schneider and you takes us first 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.790

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.370
 insist that the opening of the final fight 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.370
