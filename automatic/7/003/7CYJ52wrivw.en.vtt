00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.099
 this year we have seen the appearance of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.779
 many smart watches but if there 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.750
 one that takes the prize and is in my 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 opinion my favorite is the pin of nation 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.649
 maybe it's a bit big but 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.119
 the truth is that one thing that the 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.099
 difference is that you do not have to be 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.350
 paired with no phone because 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 this clock is itself a phone 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.920
 cell phone has a 2.4 screen 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.339
 inches with resolution of 320 x 240 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.260
 pixels 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.149
 also includes living's android 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 complete that means you can 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.590
 access the play store and with that you can 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.969
 download any application we are 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.949
 doing a demonstration right now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.420
 are playing angry birds and believe me 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.890
 although it was not the small screen 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 it was seen that they had many difficulties 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.690
 to play it also unlike what 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.660
 what could you believe is pretty light 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 it weighs only 60 grams so you do not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.570
 you have to worry because you're going to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 to tire the arm to be carrying everything 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 the day now look good with only 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.740
 press this button here I can 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.270
 remove it from its packaging and access the rest 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.530
 of the functions has a camera 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.750
 frontal vga 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.299
 with flash included and in the part of 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.400
 back a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.380
 also with flash included obviously 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
 so you can take pictures without 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 no problem anywhere and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.080
 so to have video calls 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 you can also bring sky in fact the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.300
 another one that we were taught if he brought Skype and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.369
 had of hangouts also has this 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.229
 side the volume rocker the button 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.930
 on look with this we learn and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.630
 we turned it off and also the entrance to 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 three and a half for the hearing aids that you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.330
 allows to connect any type of 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.220
 headset as well as compatibility 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 bluetooth so you do not have to be 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.759
 worrying you can use it also as 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.030
 as a phone directly because it brings 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.830
 the microphone and speaker included but 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 I think it should be half weird to be 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.860
 speaking there with this in your ear can you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.979
 put any bluetooth device 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.069
 compatible in order with a price of 325 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.250
 dollars for the model of 16gb and 400 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.830
 dollars for the 32GB model in my 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.269
 opinion this at the moment is the king of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.269
 smart watches
