00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.370 
really played it so right now they're
just<00:00:26.519> explaining<00:00:27.210> how<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.810> works<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.320> I'll

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
just explaining how this works and I'll

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.960 
just explaining how this works and I'll
explain<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> goes<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.670> basically

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
explain to you as it goes it's basically

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.820 
explain to you as it goes it's basically
a<00:00:30.090> one-on-one<00:00:30.539> game<00:00:30.779> where<00:00:31.199> everyone<00:00:31.439> plays

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
a one-on-one game where everyone plays

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
a one-on-one game where everyone plays
so<00:00:32.099> basically<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.090> dude<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> six

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so basically the dude it's up to six

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.450 
so basically the dude it's up to six
points<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.680> think<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.130> we're<00:00:35.219> playing<00:00:35.280> up
