00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.950
 another very important element of training 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.490
 shooting is the right adoption 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.130
 rack with respect to the line of fire 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 so much should be half reversal clinics 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.279
 in no case need to stand straight 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.740
 not in combat and sport shooting because 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 that physiologically our body is built 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.579
 in such a way that when we are in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.329
 half turn 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.450
 Here at an outstretched hand in addition not 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 no thoughts included that is 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 check the next correct combat 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:53.039
 rack 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:58.770
 I put the gun at the target then I lower 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.469
 arm close our eyes and raise again 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.030
 hand gun must inspect 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.280
 the same point have them when re 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.760
 your gun concept goes away in one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 word or the other side means 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.950
 accordingly you need to make a turn 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 so that the arm after raising 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.409
 looking right on target this 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.280
 called the correct stand of many and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.549
 poke shoulder-width wide should 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 be a little bit needed 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.009
 it is necessary to bend extra tension 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.829
 spine remove that is so 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.869
 it turns out that with the right 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.820
 Slyunky you have a spine and stomach 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.630
 a little bit as you come forward will come 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.399
 weakens vertebral left hand should 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.899
 be either in the pocket of the magnets on you 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.329
 totally disturb him in your pocket 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.399
 or for a belt that is, before you last 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.860
 do not forget it must be freely 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.070
 in some loosely put this here 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.630
 correct position for shooting and yet 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.969
 one very important point position 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.740
 heads 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.520
 some novice blades raise 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.860
 high shoulder 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.590
 that's wrong for what should be on 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.129
 there are no shoulder lifts at least 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.720
 must 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.349
 the hand can be like this 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 from here 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.170
 the shoulder is in place of the chin 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.489
 parallel to the floor i mean you already have a gun 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.129
 adjust the position for shooting but 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.220
 not so let's say aim and then 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:36.390
 you start to push the head that is 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.290
 on the contrary, you hold to start correctly 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.350
 head and under this word the position of the head 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.690
 then adjust the cyst 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.750
 that's about the right combat 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.950
 stories again show the correct rack 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.260
 i.e. feet shoulder width body cook 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.730
 turn from the line of fire 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.300
 hand rises head straight if you 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.770
 shoot to the right of the hand covers the left 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.100
 eye training first when you shoot 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.390
 from left hand 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.420
 closing the right eye is worth the heart 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.280
 need either right eye don't shoot 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.670
 right hand eat and shoot left 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.100
 left eye then as you master 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.970
 skill man does not close his eyes at all 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.540
 I mean when it comes to combat 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.380
 shooting 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.840
 he looks his eyes on seeing the fly and 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.490
 seeing prices ahead of it there is 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.930
 special exercise about which we 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.930
 talk a little later
