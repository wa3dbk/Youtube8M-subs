yes absolutely so let me let me show you
a<00:00:40.350> few<00:00:40.410> things<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.070> BlackBerry

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
a few things this is the BlackBerry

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
a few things this is the BlackBerry
PlayBook<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> 7-inch<00:00:42.600> tablet

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
PlayBook it's a 7-inch tablet

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.670 
PlayBook it's a 7-inch tablet
it's<00:00:43.440> powered<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.610> TI<00:00:45.120> OMAP<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.960> SOC<00:00:46.500> which

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it's powered by a TI OMAP for SOC which

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's powered by a TI OMAP for SOC which
uses<00:00:47.100> dual<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.730> nine<00:00:47.940> cortex<00:00:48.450> technology<00:00:48.989> from

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
uses dual a nine cortex technology from

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
uses dual a nine cortex technology from
arm<00:00:49.879> one<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> key<00:00:51.270> things<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.690> we've

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
arm one of the key things that we've

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.410 
arm one of the key things that we've
done<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> PlayBook<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
done here with with the PlayBook is to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
done here with with the PlayBook is to
really<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> capabilities<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
really show the capabilities of the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.479 
really show the capabilities of the
cubix<00:00:56.940> operating<00:00:57.329> system<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.109> particular

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
cubix operating system and in particular

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.709 
cubix operating system and in particular
multitasking<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.270> relies<00:01:00.690> on

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
multitasking and that really relies on

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
multitasking and that really relies on
the<00:01:01.379> performance<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> tunics<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the performance of tunics and the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.109 
the performance of tunics and the
performance<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.470> dual<00:01:04.890> cortex<00:01:05.400> a9<00:01:05.580> from

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
performance of the dual cortex a9 from

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
performance of the dual cortex a9 from
arm<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.320> I've<00:01:07.439> got<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> playbook

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
arm so what I've got here on a playbook

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.340 
arm so what I've got here on a playbook
is<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> set<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> applications<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.260> are

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
is a set of applications that are

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980 
is a set of applications that are
running<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.310> OpenGL<00:01:12.090> applications<00:01:12.780> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
running these are OpenGL applications I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
running these are OpenGL applications I
have<00:01:13.020> YouTube<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:14.010> example<00:01:14.100> that's<00:01:14.640> running

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
have YouTube for example that's running

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.140 
have YouTube for example that's running
I<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.570> web<00:01:15.810> browser<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.580> another<00:01:17.820> 3d

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I have a web browser and have another 3d

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
I have a web browser and have another 3d
game<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> quake<00:01:18.869> three<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.830> you'll

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
game this is quake three now you'll

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
game this is quake three now you'll
notice<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> these<00:01:21.150> applications

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
notice that all of these applications

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.499 
notice that all of these applications
are<00:01:22.140> running<00:01:22.409> concurrently<00:01:23.210> right<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.360> we're

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
are running concurrently right so we're

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.179 
are running concurrently right so we're
not<00:01:24.659> doing<00:01:24.930> single<00:01:25.320> tasking<00:01:25.799> we're<00:01:26.040> not

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
not doing single tasking we're not

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.320 
not doing single tasking we're not
shutting<00:01:26.369> down<00:01:26.610> applications<00:01:27.150> we're

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
shutting down applications we're

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.700 
shutting down applications we're
actually<00:01:27.600> enabling<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.409> run<00:01:28.590> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
actually enabling them to all run in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
actually enabling them to all run in
parallel<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.360> something<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
parallel and this is something that is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.569 
parallel and this is something that is
unique<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.500> requires<00:01:31.680> obviously<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> lot<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
unique and requires obviously a lot of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.210 
unique and requires obviously a lot of
performance<00:01:33.060> which<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.329> something<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
performance which is something that the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.480 
performance which is something that the
a9<00:01:35.689> delivers<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> I'll<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.979> show<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a9 delivers and I'll just show you so

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.520 
a9 delivers and I'll just show you so
that<00:01:38.520> people

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
that people

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.290 
that people
see<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:40.160> is<00:01:40.340> real<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.580> can<00:01:40.820> go<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.090> switch

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
see this is real I can go and switch

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.330 
see this is real I can go and switch
between<00:01:41.450> applications<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.380> can<00:01:42.500> see<00:01:42.740> they're

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
between applications you can see they're

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.790 
between applications you can see they're
all<00:01:43.460> running<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.570> even<00:01:44.720> play<00:01:44.930> videos<00:01:45.410> while

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
all running I can even play videos while

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.310 
all running I can even play videos while

games and so on thank you for showing us

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.750 
games and so on thank you for showing us
the<00:01:56.810> demo<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.350> playbook<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:58.670> are

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
the demo of the playbook so what are

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.790 
the demo of the playbook so what are
your<00:01:58.850> plans<00:01:58.880> moving<00:01:59.630> forward<00:02:00.170> with<00:02:00.530> quad-core

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
your plans moving forward with quad-core

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.580 
your plans moving forward with quad-core
and<00:02:01.310> multi-core<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.210> other<00:02:02.600> devices<00:02:02.930> well

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
and multi-core and other devices well

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.990 
and multi-core and other devices well
that's<00:02:03.770> that's<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.250> great<00:02:04.430> question<00:02:04.730> in<00:02:04.850> fact

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
that's that's a great question in fact

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.480 
that's that's a great question in fact
qnx<00:02:05.570> has<00:02:05.690> been<00:02:05.840> supporting<00:02:06.350> multi-core<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
qnx has been supporting multi-core and

think<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.250> were<00:02:10.340> probably<00:02:10.520> there<00:02:10.790> first

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
think we were probably there first

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.810 
think we were probably there first
and<00:02:11.950> obviously<00:02:12.950> we're<00:02:13.130> leveraging<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.580> into

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
a company for over 30 years so we're in

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.120

and<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.450> probably<00:02:50.570> use<00:02:50.780> Q<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.110> X<00:02:51.170> every

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
and so on you probably use Q and X every

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.809 
and so on you probably use Q and X every
day<00:02:51.620> without<00:02:52.400> even<00:02:52.640> knowing<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
day without even knowing it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.729
