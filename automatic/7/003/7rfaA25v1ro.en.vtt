00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
put pressure on on the engine so that

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.020 
put pressure on on the engine so that
when<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.410> bust<00:03:08.650> these<00:03:08.800> loose<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.760> engine

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
when I bust these loose that the engine

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.330 
when I bust these loose that the engine
doesn't<00:03:10.209> rotate<00:03:10.480> one<00:03:10.900> way<00:03:11.080> or<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> other<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.830> I

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
doesn't rotate one way or the other so I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.820 
doesn't rotate one way or the other so I
hold<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.730> onion<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:15.790> still<00:03:16.030> tight

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
hold the onion it's still tight

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:25.530 
hold the onion it's still tight
so<00:03:17.830> next<00:03:18.100> one<00:03:19.410> yeah<00:03:21.209> get<00:03:22.209> them<00:03:22.300> loose<00:03:24.540> because

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
you don't want the engine to roll okay

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.170 
you don't want the engine to roll okay
these<00:03:30.100> are<00:03:30.250> all<00:03:30.280> loose<00:03:30.580> now<00:03:32.850> now<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.880> can<00:03:34.060> take

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
and I'm going to turn the pulley so I

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.150 
and I'm going to turn the pulley so I
get<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.330> slot<00:04:12.600> when<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.500> get<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.950> slot

get to the slot when I get to the slot

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.440 
get to the slot when I get to the slot
and<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.520> pulley<00:04:14.730> comes<00:04:15.000> right<00:04:15.240> off

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
and the pulley comes right off

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.600 
to put the bolts in I'm not going to
change<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.800> flange<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:48.000> flange<00:04:48.300> is<00:04:48.540> good<00:04:49.610> for

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
change the flange the flange is good for

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
change the flange the flange is good for
what<00:04:50.760> I'm<00:04:50.940> doing<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:52.260> 32<00:04:52.860> threads<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:54.270> lot

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
what I'm doing the 32 threads is a lot

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.310 
what I'm doing the 32 threads is a lot
taller<00:04:54.960> on<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.640> three<00:04:56.640> start<00:04:57.000> points<00:04:57.510> which

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
taller on the three start points which

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.580 
taller on the three start points which
would<00:04:58.560> not<00:04:58.860> allow<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.220> 28<00:04:59.880> to<00:04:59.910> go<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:00.590> some

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
would not allow the 28 to go on some

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.170 
would not allow the 28 to go on some
guys<00:05:01.830> take<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.340> round<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.730> off<00:05:02.880> with<00:05:03.090> the

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
guys take and round it off with the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.680 
guys take and round it off with the
Dremel<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.690> all<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.290> that's<00:05:04.650> fine<00:05:05.010> I'm<00:05:05.130> glad

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690
