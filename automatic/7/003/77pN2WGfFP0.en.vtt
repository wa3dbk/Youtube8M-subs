00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it's not just your your regular geometry

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
it's not just your your regular geometry
smoothie<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.840> amplified<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> big

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
smoothie or it's amplified with a big

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.339 
smoothie or it's amplified with a big
amount<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> nutrition<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.240> boost<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.750> boosted

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
amount of nutrition you boost it boosted

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
amount of nutrition you boost it boosted
like<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.650> beyond<00:00:32.040> let's<00:00:32.579> talk<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
like you beyond let's talk about the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
like you beyond let's talk about the
Boosters<00:00:33.600> first<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.530> little

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
Boosters first of all we have little

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
Boosters first of all we have little
piles<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.880> lecithin

taste it yeah at all then then you have
the<00:01:02.489> flax<00:01:02.760> seeds<00:01:03.030> these<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.780> what<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the flax seeds these are what is the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.899 
the flax seeds these are what is the
only<00:01:04.559> type<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> fire<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.610> called<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
only type of fire which is called a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
only type of fire which is called a
lignin<00:01:06.270> fiber<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.049> actually<00:01:07.229> scrape

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
lignin fiber and they actually scrape

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170 
lignin fiber and they actually scrape
bacteria<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.340> intestinal<00:01:08.760> walls<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bacteria your intestinal walls as it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
bacteria your intestinal walls as it
comes<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.570> hmm<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
comes down hmm and then you have the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.500 
comes down hmm and then you have the
lubricant<00:01:11.250> which<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.090> i<00:01:12.150> call<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
lubricant which is that's what i call it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.090 
lubricant which is that's what i call it
because<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> base<00:01:12.960> lubricates<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> intestines

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
because a base lubricates the intestines

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
because a base lubricates the intestines
and<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> helps<00:01:14.670> again<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.330> passage<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.780> food

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and it helps again the passage of food

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570 
and it helps again the passage of food
isn't<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.590> gesso<00:01:16.830> system<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> whole

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
isn't that a gesso system is a whole

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.980 
isn't that a gesso system is a whole
