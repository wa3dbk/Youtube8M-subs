00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.159
 the national team returned its first 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.380
 training in the sports complex 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.870
 of the federation week of football under 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.540
 the technical direction the Spanish albert 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.570
 Rock was worked on the physical aspect 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.239
 after training the coach gave 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.519
 statements we were looking for then the 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.529
 Defense-attack transition speed 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.230
 defense attack that were clear from 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.919
 that when we defend we defend all 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.179
 when we attack we have to try 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.460
 retain the ball as much as possible to 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.349
 look for a solution we've done it with 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.170
 conservation then with a finalization 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.270
 but above all what we like is that 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.600
 not that the intensity of the exercises 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.000
 be it good 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.579
 knowing also that there were three groups 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.930
 very different from the team of fans 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.329
 that practically came from two or three 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.089
 holidays to other players 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.839
 Well, their names were disqualified 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.909
 teams since they have been without 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.089
 perform any type of training and 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.739
 well definitely that was what with and 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.390
 well my other group of five players 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.130
 As you know, they had four or 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.619
 five days training doing 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.299
 physical conditioning with Pablo and 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.830
 they had a little bit of gain in the aspect 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.390
 physical 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.700
 around the stature of the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.700
 selected to see it here commented what 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.420
 next the Salvadoran maybe because the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.060
 biotype is a little less than the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.280
 Honduran perhaps less strong than the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.320
 Costa Rican but they are things that happen 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.700
 but I come from a country like in Spain 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.190
 and a team like Barcelona where 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 the little ones have triumphed because they 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.660
 we can think the same thing is a matter 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.730
 obviously of faith and work is not 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.440
 a question we already know that iniesta does not 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.170
 it has been formed in two days but it takes 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.510
 a very big evolution but but I what 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.100
 I have said sometimes that football Saturday did not 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.560
 he has to go back a bit to his roots 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.250
 and find what kind of soccer suits you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.870
 and maybe it's a football in which good 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.280
 so you have to think more you have 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.200
 to be smarter than others to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.130
 supply in some way our 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.479
 physical deficiencies 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 on behalf of the players 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.920
 gave statements 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.349
 Eric Molina for a better one is 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.860
 important to wear the shirt of 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.860
 our country 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.650
 It is gratifying to be here and with all 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.900
 the partners that is that they have 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.180
 strived to have this call and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.150
 the truth very satisfied with the first 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.980
 training and with high expectations 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.170
 we'll see that fiction is here 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.540
 damaged by what has happened but 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.700
 That is behind us now this group 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 of young people who want to try to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.500
 change the image of the country of the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.340
 selection and that's what we're going to give 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.020
 the all for the all in each 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.490
 training and being taken into account 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.740
 the selection has scheduled its 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.360
 training this Friday at 5 o'clock 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.160
 afternoon at the sports complex of the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.170
 federation about her soccer for
