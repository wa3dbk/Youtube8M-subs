Joey<00:00:09.519> is<00:00:09.670> made<00:00:09.820> out<00:00:09.969> of<00:00:10.000> three<00:00:10.629> main<00:00:10.990> materials

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
Joey is made out of three main materials

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.400 
Joey is made out of three main materials
he's<00:00:11.709> made<00:00:11.860> out<00:00:11.889> of<00:00:12.039> a<00:00:12.430> wicker<00:00:13.030> /<00:00:13.510> /<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.199> frame

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
he's made out of a wicker / / the frame

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.740 
he's made out of a wicker / / the frame
to<00:00:14.590> give<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.859> shape<00:00:15.070> aluminum<00:00:15.939> is<00:00:16.119> the<00:00:16.150> actual

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
to give the shape aluminum is the actual

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.599 
to give the shape aluminum is the actual
frame<00:00:17.050> which<00:00:17.289> gives<00:00:17.529> rigidity<00:00:18.310> for<00:00:18.550> the

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
frame which gives rigidity for the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.580 
frame which gives rigidity for the
actors<00:00:19.269> to<00:00:19.449> strap<00:00:19.689> into<00:00:19.990> her<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.170> puppeteers

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
actors to strap into her the puppeteers

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.220 
actors to strap into her the puppeteers
and<00:00:20.769> then<00:00:21.400> he's<00:00:21.519> got<00:00:21.640> mesh<00:00:22.089> which<00:00:22.480> makes<00:00:23.079> him

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
and then he's got mesh which makes him

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.499 
and then he's got mesh which makes him
look<00:00:23.349> full<00:00:23.740> it<00:00:24.369> also<00:00:24.519> allows<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.029> actors<00:00:25.359> to

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
look full it also allows the actors to

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.880 
look full it also allows the actors to
be<00:00:25.539> able<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.779> see<00:00:25.960> out<00:00:26.079> a<00:00:26.109> little<00:00:26.380> bit<00:00:26.589> but<00:00:26.740> when

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
be able to see out a little bit but when

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.620 
be able to see out a little bit but when
it's<00:00:27.039> lit<00:00:27.310> you<00:00:27.730> can't<00:00:27.939> see<00:00:28.150> right<00:00:28.329> through<00:00:28.570> it

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
it's lit you can't see right through it

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's lit you can't see right through it
which<00:00:28.869> is<00:00:28.989> a<00:00:29.019> very<00:00:29.859> nice<00:00:30.070> composition<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.970> the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
which is a very nice composition of the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.319 
which is a very nice composition of the
the<00:00:31.720> art<00:00:31.900> of<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:33.930> joey<00:00:34.930> is<00:00:35.170> built<00:00:35.530> over<00:00:36.010> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the art of it joey is built over a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.150 
the art of it joey is built over a
fairly<00:00:37.329> long<00:00:37.510> course<00:00:37.960> of<00:00:38.110> time<00:00:38.350> at<00:00:38.680> handspring

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
fairly long course of time at handspring

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.940 
fairly long course of time at handspring
puppet<00:00:39.190> Factory<00:00:39.880> which<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.660> in<00:00:40.870> South<00:00:41.500> Africa

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
puppet Factory which is in South Africa

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.500 
puppet Factory which is in South Africa
and<00:00:42.220> so<00:00:42.700> they're<00:00:42.850> all<00:00:42.940> built<00:00:43.150> and<00:00:43.390> shipped

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
and so they're all built and shipped

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.020 
and so they're all built and shipped
over<00:00:43.840> here<00:00:44.020> and<00:00:44.290> I<00:00:44.860> believe<00:00:45.460> they<00:00:45.610> start<00:00:45.880> with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
over here and I believe they start with

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.310 
over here and I believe they start with
the<00:00:46.150> aluminum<00:00:46.510> frame<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.900> then<00:00:46.990> they<00:00:47.080> start

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
the aluminum frame and then they start

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200 
the aluminum frame and then they start
just<00:00:47.500> wrapping<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.400> cane<00:00:48.580> around<00:00:48.790> and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
just wrapping the the cane around and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.880 
just wrapping the the cane around and
getting<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.480> forms<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.960> they<00:00:50.080> want<00:00:50.320> so

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
getting the forms that they want so

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.860 
getting the forms that they want so
every<00:00:51.220> horse<00:00:51.430> is<00:00:51.640> actually<00:00:52.150> different<00:00:52.660> they

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
every horse is actually different they

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.660 
every horse is actually different they
don't<00:00:53.020> they<00:00:53.620> don't<00:00:53.770> build<00:00:53.920> them<00:00:54.040> on<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> form

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
don't they don't build them on a form

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.130 
don't they don't build them on a form
they<00:00:54.880> don't<00:00:55.030> Bend<00:00:55.270> each<00:00:55.480> each<00:00:55.810> piece

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
they don't Bend each each piece

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.670 
they don't Bend each each piece
specifically<00:00:56.710> it's<00:00:57.370> just<00:00:58.000> hand<00:00:58.720> done<00:00:59.050> hand

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
specifically it's just hand done hand

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.380 
specifically it's just hand done hand
wrap<00:00:59.980> they<00:01:00.250> wrap<00:01:00.580> little<00:01:00.850> bits<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.090> string

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
wrap they wrap little bits of string

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.480 
wrap they wrap little bits of string
around<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:02.320> hold<00:01:02.440> everything<00:01:02.740> in<00:01:03.010> place<00:01:03.040> and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
around to hold everything in place and

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.300 
around to hold everything in place and
then<00:01:03.579> just<00:01:03.730> glue<00:01:03.910> over<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.299> string<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:06.250> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
then just glue over the string for the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.429 
then just glue over the string for the
most<00:01:06.460> part<00:01:06.759> Joey<00:01:06.939> stays<00:01:07.210> as<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.450> whole<00:01:07.689> he<00:01:07.930> he

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
most part Joey stays as a whole he he

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.990 
most part Joey stays as a whole he he
also<00:01:08.560> travels<00:01:09.009> as<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.159> whole<00:01:09.400> when<00:01:09.550> we<00:01:09.670> move<00:01:09.850> him

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
also travels as a whole when we move him

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.630 
also travels as a whole when we move him
we<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:11.050> know<00:01:11.140> we<00:01:11.290> travel<00:01:12.130> him<00:01:12.220> we<00:01:12.310> get<00:01:12.430> him<00:01:12.550> all

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
we you know we travel him we get him all

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.250 
we you know we travel him we get him all
set<00:01:12.820> up<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.120> nice<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.420> safe<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.570> secure<00:01:14.080> and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
and he travels all in one piece as well

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.870 
and he travels all in one piece as well
so<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:16.600> never<00:01:16.900> really<00:01:16.960> take<00:01:17.290> Joey<00:01:17.500> apart

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.609 

each<00:01:22.390> actor<00:01:22.869> has<00:01:23.049> kind<00:01:23.259> of<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.380> physical

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
each actor has kind of a physical

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.740 
each actor has kind of a physical
movement<00:01:24.070> apart<00:01:24.549> that<00:01:24.670> they<00:01:24.789> carry<00:01:25.060> as<00:01:25.299> well

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
movement apart that they carry as well

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.709 
movement apart that they carry as well
as<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.439> as<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:26.829> like<00:01:27.579> emotional<00:01:28.119> movement<00:01:28.299> but

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
as a as a like emotional movement but

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.789 
as a as a like emotional movement but
that<00:01:28.780> can<00:01:29.079> also<00:01:29.200> be<00:01:29.350> something<00:01:29.680> that's

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
that can also be something that's

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.710 
that can also be something that's
physical<00:01:30.189> so<00:01:30.460> for<00:01:31.119> instance<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.509> head

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
physical so for instance the head

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.270 
physical so for instance the head
actually<00:01:31.990> controls<00:01:32.470> where<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.740> head<00:01:32.860> points

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
actually controls where the head points

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.480 
actually controls where the head points
but<00:01:33.820> he<00:01:33.880> also<00:01:34.000> moves<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.539> ears<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.189> heart

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
but he also moves the ears the heart

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.520 
but he also moves the ears the heart
position<00:01:37.060> has<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.719> two<00:01:37.960> different<00:01:38.229> movements

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
position has the two different movements

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.469 
position has the two different movements
he<00:01:38.590> actually<00:01:38.829> curls<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.340> feet<00:01:39.520> as<00:01:40.119> well<00:01:40.360> as

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
he actually curls the feet as well as

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
actually holding heart but his emotion

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.460 
actually holding heart but his emotion
is<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:42.700> breathe<00:01:43.000> with<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.899> horse<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
is to breathe with the horse and the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.679 
is to breathe with the horse and the
hind<00:01:44.649> moves<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.729> rear<00:01:45.909> feet<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.270> flicks<00:01:46.509> the

rear tail it's a balance that you're

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.419 
rear tail it's a balance that you're
having<00:01:49.689> between<00:01:50.200> whether<00:01:50.470> you're<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.100> control
