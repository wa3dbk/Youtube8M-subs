to<00:01:04.949> angiotensin<00:01:05.549> 2<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> three

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to angiotensin 2 and then the three

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.080 
to angiotensin 2 and then the three
following<00:01:08.280> steps<00:01:08.939> occur<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.740> slow<00:01:11.520> presser

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
following steps occur the slow presser

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
following steps occur the slow presser
response<00:01:12.890> which<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.570> alternative<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:16.200> altered

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.780 
response which is alternative or altered
renal<00:01:17.580> function<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:19.470> occurs<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
renal function this occurs because of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.609 
renal function this occurs because of
aldosterone<00:01:21.689> release<00:01:23.450> which<00:01:24.619> increases

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
aldosterone release which increases

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
aldosterone release which increases
sodium<00:01:26.310> absorption<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> proximal

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
sodium absorption in the proximal

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.920 
sodium absorption in the proximal
tubules<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.360> increases<00:01:30.360> potassium

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
tubules and increases potassium

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.550 
tubules and increases potassium
secretion<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.780> renal<00:01:33.829> vasoconstriction

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
secretion and renal vasoconstriction

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.240 
secretion and renal vasoconstriction
also<00:01:37.560> increased<00:01:38.430> naropa<00:01:39.150> nephron<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
also increased naropa nephron and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.569 
also increased naropa nephron and
sympathetic<00:01:41.250> tone<00:01:41.729> within<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> kidney<00:01:43.579> then

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
sympathetic tone within the kidney then

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.080 
sympathetic tone within the kidney then
the<00:01:45.060> rapid<00:01:45.750> pressure<00:01:46.020> response<00:01:46.850> which<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the rapid pressure response which is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.139 
the rapid pressure response which is
altered<00:01:48.600> peripheral<00:01:49.409> resistance<00:01:50.119> due<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
altered peripheral resistance due to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.340 
altered peripheral resistance due to
peripheral<00:01:52.110> vasoconstriction<00:01:54.350> increased

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
peripheral vasoconstriction increased

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.679 
peripheral vasoconstriction increased
naropa<00:01:56.159> nephron<00:01:56.520> release<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.119> decreased

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
naropa nephron release and decreased

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.039 
naropa nephron release and decreased
uptake<00:01:58.460> which<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.850> cause<00:02:00.149> increased

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
uptake which can cause increased

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.560 
uptake which can cause increased
sympathetic<00:02:01.590> activity<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.790> central<00:02:03.390> nervous

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
sympathetic activity in central nervous

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
sympathetic activity in central nervous
system<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:05.549> increases<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.630> vascular

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
system and it increases the vascular

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.300 
system and it increases the vascular
response<00:02:07.849> also<00:02:09.709> catecholamine<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.920> released

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
response also catecholamine is released

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.900 
response also catecholamine is released
from<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.879> adrenal<00:02:11.970> medulla

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
from the adrenal medulla

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.370 
from the adrenal medulla
and<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.330> third<00:02:14.630> stage<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:17.200> vascular<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and the third stage is vascular and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.300 
and the third stage is vascular and

cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.120 
cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling this
brings<00:02:22.700> about<00:02:22.850> an<00:02:23.390> altered<00:02:24.140> cardiovascular

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
brings about an altered cardiovascular

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.930 
brings about an altered cardiovascular
