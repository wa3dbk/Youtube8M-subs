but I enjoy the collect inside of it and
all<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.610> stuff<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.269> me<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.989> big<00:03:10.200> fan

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
all that stuff so for me I was a big fan

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.800 
all that stuff so for me I was a big fan
of<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.920> sort<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.310> thing<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.790> that's<00:03:12.600> one

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
of that sort of thing so that's one

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.270 
of that sort of thing so that's one
thing<00:03:12.959> i<00:03:13.050> really<00:03:13.080> like<00:03:13.320> i'm<00:03:13.620> doing<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
thing i really like i'm doing and the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.590 
thing i really like i'm doing and the
tournament<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:14.850> they're<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.330> make<00:03:15.450> it

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
tournament if they're going to make it

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.690 
tournament if they're going to make it
to<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.170> can't<00:03:16.890> buy<00:03:17.040> coins<00:03:17.280> which<00:03:17.550> i

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
to that and you can't buy coins which i

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.130 
to that and you can't buy coins which i
guess<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:17.970> fair<00:03:18.299> enough<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:18.959> they're

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
guess is fair enough and if they're

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.110 
guess is fair enough and if they're
going<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.350> force<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.280> buy<00:03:20.610> fifa

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
going to force you to have to buy fifa

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.460 
going to force you to have to buy fifa
points<00:03:21.360> if<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.600> want<00:03:21.720> open<00:03:21.989> packs<00:03:22.200> then

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
points if you want open packs then

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.350 
points if you want open packs then
that's<00:03:22.920> ridiculous<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.610> if<00:03:23.820> they're<00:03:24.030> actually

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
that's ridiculous so if they're actually

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.789 
that's ridiculous so if they're actually
going<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.570> give<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> guys<00:03:24.989> chances<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
going to give you guys chances to

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.800 
going to give you guys chances to
actually<00:03:26.160> earn<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.700> stuff<00:03:26.940> because<00:03:27.299> right

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
actually earn the stuff because right

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.120 
actually earn the stuff because right
now<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:28.140> you're<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.350> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.709> play<00:03:28.860> games

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
now if you're just going to play games

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.890 
now if you're just going to play games
through<00:03:29.579> divisions<00:03:30.120> you're<00:03:30.540> never<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:30.870> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
through divisions you're never going to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.060 
through divisions you're never going to
make<00:03:31.019> enough<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.470> be<00:03:31.560> able<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.739> get<00:03:31.829> any<00:03:31.980> good

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
make enough to be able to get any good

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.860 
make enough to be able to get any good
players<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:32.640> you're<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.000> get<00:03:33.150> like

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.069 
15 cave winning a tournament place
you're<00:03:35.970> going<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.150> get<00:03:36.239> pack<00:03:36.510> stuff<00:03:36.840> like<00:03:37.049> that

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
you're going to get pack stuff like that

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.530 
you're going to get pack stuff like that
that<00:03:37.440> is<00:03:37.890> makes<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.670> fair<00:03:38.910> makes<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.269> want<00:03:39.450> to

that is makes it fair makes you want to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.660 
that is makes it fair makes you want to
actually<00:03:39.720> play<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.140> game<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.590> try<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.100> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
actually play the game to try and I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.580 
actually play the game to try and I
guess<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.420> fair<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.750> square<00:03:42.930> about<00:03:43.320> having

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
guess do it fair and square about having

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.400 
guess do it fair and square about having
to<00:03:43.709> spend<00:03:43.920> like<00:03:44.130> 20<00:03:45.090> pound<00:03:45.360> for<00:03:45.600> 100k<00:03:46.019> pack

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
to spend like 20 pound for 100k pack

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.319 
to spend like 20 pound for 100k pack
like<00:03:46.650> why<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.250> earth<00:03:47.489> would<00:03:47.760> anyone<00:03:48.000> want<00:03:48.239> to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
like why on earth would anyone want to

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.210 
like why on earth would anyone want to
do<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:48.780> absolutely<00:03:49.350> ludicrous<00:03:49.709> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
do that is just absolutely ludicrous so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.310 
do that is just absolutely ludicrous so
I<00:03:50.400> guess<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.780> sort<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.019> thing<00:03:52.079> you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
I guess this is the sort of thing you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.390 
I guess this is the sort of thing you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
every single way but at least they're

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.699 
every single way but at least they're
making<00:04:06.239> an<00:04:06.329> effort<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.810> make<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.110> game<00:04:07.320> less
