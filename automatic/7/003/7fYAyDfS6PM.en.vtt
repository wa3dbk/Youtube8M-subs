00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.140 

we're<00:00:15.290> gonna<00:00:15.470> learn<00:00:15.740> about<00:00:16.100> creating<00:00:16.460> a<00:00:16.940> base

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
we're gonna learn about creating a base

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.290 
we're gonna learn about creating a base
flange<00:00:17.740> but<00:00:18.740> first<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.400> want<00:00:19.700> to<00:00:19.820> talk<00:00:20.060> about

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
flange but first I want to talk about

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.420 
flange but first I want to talk about
the<00:00:20.600> concept<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.470> sheet<00:00:21.890> metal

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
the concept of sheet metal

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.600 
the concept of sheet metal
what<00:00:22.640> is<00:00:22.910> sheet<00:00:23.450> metal<00:00:23.950> you<00:00:24.950> can<00:00:25.130> think<00:00:25.490> about

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
what is sheet metal you can think about

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.210 
what is sheet metal you can think about
sheet<00:00:26.150> metal<00:00:26.509> as<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:26.720> thin<00:00:27.200> solid<00:00:27.860> with<00:00:28.189> a

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
sheet metal as a thin solid with a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.780 
sheet metal as a thin solid with a
constant<00:00:29.029> thickness<00:00:29.300> value

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
constant thickness value

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.090 
constant thickness value
the<00:00:32.060> sheet<00:00:32.360> metal<00:00:32.570> set<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.110> tools<00:00:33.410> come<00:00:33.830> on<00:00:34.070> a

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
the sheet metal set of tools come on a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.760 
the sheet metal set of tools come on a
tap<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:34.970> let's<00:00:35.240> right-click<00:00:35.510> on<00:00:35.840> any<00:00:36.170> tab<00:00:36.530> and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
tap so let's right-click on any tab and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.130 
tap so let's right-click on any tab and
select<00:00:37.490> sheet<00:00:37.730> metal<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.180> make<00:00:38.510> it<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.750> visible

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
select sheet metal to make it a visible

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.310 
select sheet metal to make it a visible
tab<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:40.640> also<00:00:40.880> access<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.840> sheet<00:00:42.080> metal

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
tab you can also access the sheet metal

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.700 
tab you can also access the sheet metal
tools<00:00:42.770> via<00:00:43.220> insert<00:00:43.850> on<00:00:44.060> the<00:00:44.180> main<00:00:44.420> menu<00:00:44.710> scroll

tools via insert on the main menu scroll

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.250 
tools via insert on the main menu scroll
the<00:00:45.830> sheet<00:00:46.070> metal<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.809> here's<00:00:47.809> our<00:00:47.960> sheet

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
the sheet metal and here's our sheet

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.819 
the sheet metal and here's our sheet
metal<00:00:48.559> tools

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.970 

let's<00:00:52.460> go<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:53.120> sheet<00:00:53.329> metal<00:00:53.540> tab<00:00:53.930> as<00:00:54.140> you

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
let's go to the sheet metal tab as you

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.280 
let's go to the sheet metal tab as you
can<00:00:55.430> see<00:00:55.670> here<00:00:55.910> most<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.329> my<00:00:56.390> tools<00:00:56.510> are<00:00:57.050> grayed

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
can see here most of my tools are grayed

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.130 
can see here most of my tools are grayed
out<00:00:57.760> let's<00:00:58.760> begin<00:00:59.000> with<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.510> base<00:00:59.719> flange

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
out let's begin with the base flange

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.500 
out let's begin with the base flange
which<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.620> not<00:01:00.829> grayed<00:01:01.220> out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.690 

the<00:01:05.020> base<00:01:05.230> flange<00:01:05.620> is<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> sketch<00:01:06.430> based

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
the base flange is a sketch based

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.150 
the base flange is a sketch based
feature<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:07.510> our<00:01:07.690> first<00:01:08.080> step<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.770> create<00:01:08.950> a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
feature so our first step is to create a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.230 
feature so our first step is to create a
sketch<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.940> we<00:01:10.060> can<00:01:10.270> use<00:01:10.480> to<00:01:10.510> model<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.110> park

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
sketch that we can use to model the park

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
sketch that we can use to model the park
I'll<00:01:12.299> right-click<00:01:13.079> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> front<00:01:13.860> plane<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'll right-click on the front plane and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.390 
I'll right-click on the front plane and
select<00:01:14.640> sketch

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.670 

to<00:01:17.550> Veit<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> line<00:01:18.060> command

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.220 

and<00:01:20.770> we'll<00:01:21.160> just<00:01:21.190> place<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.640> few<00:01:22.030> lines<00:01:22.330> create

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
and we'll just place a few lines create

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.040 
and we'll just place a few lines create
an<00:01:23.350> open<00:01:23.710> profile<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:25.420> let's<00:01:25.690> apply<00:01:25.840> some

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
an open profile now let's apply some

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.180 
an open profile now let's apply some
dimensions

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.020 

50<00:01:29.760> millimeters<00:01:30.330> here

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.240 

and<00:01:33.119> 40<00:01:34.049> millimeters<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.979> line

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.170 

60<00:01:39.180> millimeters<00:01:39.690> for<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.110> third<00:01:40.410> line

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.410 

let's<00:01:44.840> place<00:01:45.140> an<00:01:45.320> angle<00:01:45.620> dimension<00:01:46.420> 135

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
let's place an angle dimension 135

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.149 
let's place an angle dimension 135
degrees

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.359 

and<00:01:50.249> I'm<00:01:50.820> ready<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.299> exit<00:01:51.749> the<00:01:51.780> sketch

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.510 

now<00:01:56.939> let's<00:01:57.210> activate<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.780> base<00:01:58.170> flange<00:01:58.649> tool

I'm going to uncheck use gauge table and

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.830 
I'm going to uncheck use gauge table and
under<00:04:36.070> Bend<00:04:36.310> allowance<00:04:36.820> let's<00:04:37.090> switch<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.630> K
