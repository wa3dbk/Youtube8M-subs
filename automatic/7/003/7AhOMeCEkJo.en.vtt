that<00:01:56.820> damages<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> monster<00:01:58.520> when<00:01:59.520> they

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that damages the monster when they

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.080

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
so I don't think a creep is a very good

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.010 
so I don't think a creep is a very good
