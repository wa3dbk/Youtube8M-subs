well<00:01:28.759> one<00:01:29.759> theory<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.720> base<00:01:30.960> because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
well one theory was that my base because

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.090 
well one theory was that my base because
it's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> skull<00:01:32.070> base<00:01:32.659> it's<00:01:33.659> crazy<00:01:33.920> anyway<00:01:34.920> one

it's a skull base it's crazy anyway one
theory<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:36.229> my<00:01:37.229> skull<00:01:37.530> base<00:01:37.740> might

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
theory was that my my skull base might

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.429 
theory was that my my skull base might
have<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.770> scared<00:01:40.770> some<00:01:41.240> people<00:01:42.290> yeah<00:01:43.340> okay

even<00:01:46.439> though<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.070> extreme<00:01:47.700> an

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
even though that's the thing extreme an

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.960 
even though that's the thing extreme an
extreme<00:01:48.149> scenario<00:01:48.600> let's<00:01:49.290> say<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.680> true

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
extreme scenario let's say that's true

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
extreme scenario let's say that's true
the<00:01:50.970> moment<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.390> got<00:01:51.420> unbanned<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.439> changed<00:01:53.130> my

the moment I got unbanned I changed my

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.270 
the moment I got unbanned I changed my
base<00:01:53.780> because<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.560> save<00:01:55.770> layout<00:01:56.130> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
base because I have to to save layout so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.679 
base because I have to to save layout so
you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.119> previous<00:01:57.299> videos
