00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello friends in this video let's see 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
 how to make these creatures that by far 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.750
 that we move seems to rotate their 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.400
 heads and they never take off the sight of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.400
 we go there 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.650
 the materials that they would need are 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.660
 glue scissors and these chips in the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.060
 description of the video I left you the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.130
 link so you can download them today 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.779
 I'm going to make all these creatures but 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.720
 I will show you only 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.180
 how to make the dinosaur the rest is 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.400
 would do the same way in the first place 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.589
 I advise you to remember the parts that 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.329
 They are roughly left over, this is so that 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.110
 then we can work with greater 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.450
 ease and precision 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 now we will remember the parts 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.190
 leftovers of the most exact form that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.890
 we can advise you that the cut is the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.940
 line pound on the outside like this 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.579
 our dinosaur will look a little better 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.760
 next we will fold the parts that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.890
 are marked by broken line 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.710
 provided they are folding a paper os 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.110
 I advise you to use a rule of this 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.530
 way we will fold more accurately and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.530
 speed 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.280
 As you can see, the broken lines are missing 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.740
 about the dinosaur because of this I will tell you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.329
 where do you have to fold first 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.069
 let's double down the imaginary line 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.069
 with these two points 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.680
 then we will bend just above the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.120
 eyes we will also stick by the same 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.300
 90 degree point 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.870
 we fold under the eyes and between the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.210
 nose and teeth and finally the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.790
 imaginary line that joins the three points 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.850
 this will help us to fold the two 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.250
 parts of the head 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.590
 the last step take off the head and the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.560
 base you can use a bit of paper 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 trimmed to put it under and avoid 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.869
 the glue stain the table paste 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.050
 the three parts in this way and already 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.569
 we have the finished head finally 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.560
 we stick the base and our dinosaur 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.150
 it's finished 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.150
 what is the result 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.600
 as you see here the optical illusion is 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.460
 can appreciate very well since the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.950
 brain is used to seeing the 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.590
 objects with volume and not like in this 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 case with the sunken head interprets the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.410
 information in such a way that it is created 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.660
 an optical illusion 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.420
 this is how all the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.910
 already finished creatures I warn you that if 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.960
 You see the glossary in person and not by 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.110
 half of a camera 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.420
 you must look at it with one eye because 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.700
 no fats with both the brain 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.280
 detect the depth correctly 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.440
 of the object preventing the occurrence of 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.080
 illusion with these latest images 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.770
 ends the video today I hope that you 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.050
 I liked greetings and until next time 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.830
 if you liked this video share

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.560
