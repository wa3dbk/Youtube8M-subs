 Parisian restaurants on this date here we eat healthy food 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.939
 since the accused lost a few seconds 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.319
 does this opportunity ensure four home successes? 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.949
 the episode dry steam no pressure obama 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.869
 if you find yourself beaten deep in the sump then it's that it's 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.289
 actually the shop 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.949
 kuyt that puts completely indispensable and 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.859
 and who in addition to satisfaction with dry steam cookers at the bar 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.969
 the foods enjoy the benefits of cooking steam I thought being in 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.220
 contact with water 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.720
 in a powerful traditional motor some vitamins are eliminated and 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.450
 the taste is made institute 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 thanks to the steam dry cooking in the steam oven at the bar keep 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.860
 of Italy 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.840
 if the food color there is something quite spectacle in my opinion the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229
 makes you feel like the product is slightly seized 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.179
 it's something that I think his normal father there is always a little bit 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.339
 but only riots the final goal that comes out right away with cooking 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.220
 steam pressure we are not hungry 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.750
 thanks to extremely short cooking times 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.710
 the steamer at the thermal park management events covered crisis 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.840

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.660
 with my son afraid earvin to the opponent 16 degrees no date of 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.190
 planned with the few traditional unlisted business 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.030
 it's true that in a form of fast food where you have a shot of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.580
 fire 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.330
 which is very common it is absolutely necessary a very powerful tool 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 beyond that it is a tool that consumes relatively little energy 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.370
 and that is so let it be our only powerful tool 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.900
 so laurent it was obviously that it is an economic and profitable tool 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.120
 the use of the steamer it is easy and the staff all agree 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.630
 manipulates it without arguing with all the services they are a hundred 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.770
 the instrumentation is to say that in fact m

 after a day the pollsters a solution adapted to the use of the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.760
 copper 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.710
 and especially since there is no risk I did not know the job of a 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.940
 deep fryer and how it is high time that a fire of straw but the fact that in 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.970
 think customers 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.730
 this is a very slight increase for all founding members are 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.470
 makes you feel 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.930
 on the occasion of

 the goal is to help children in its members 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.139
 commonly called his mental health 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.039
 and the quality of fair products 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.349
 anyway 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 lots of things that will be eliminated by hour a little trick and then go away 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.779
 5-1 to be at health prepare in a city in a sea a little 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.189
 depressing show 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.650
 and that's part of the seven reactors for the consumer to see 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.540
 the first thought curious duty to see that there is little strictly nothing that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.349
 escapes me 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.299
 so to make snapshots of these spectacular
