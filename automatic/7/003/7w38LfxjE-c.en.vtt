the other thing about wool socks is they

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.290 
the other thing about wool socks is they

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
don't get smelly as quick so you can

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.650 
don't get smelly as quick so you can
wear<00:04:25.449> cotton<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.979> wear<00:04:27.160> wool<00:04:27.370> socks<00:04:27.660> for

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
wear cotton and wear wool socks for

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.969 
wear cotton and wear wool socks for
several<00:04:28.930> days<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.350> they<00:04:29.410> will<00:04:29.560> stay<00:04:29.770> actually

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
several days and they will stay actually

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.950 
several days and they will stay actually
pretty<00:04:30.639> decent<00:04:30.970> depending<00:04:31.539> on<00:04:31.630> how<00:04:31.690> much<00:04:31.810> you

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
pretty decent depending on how much you

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.629 
pretty decent depending on how much you
sweat<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.979> can<00:04:33.100> print<00:04:33.220> some<00:04:33.370> out<00:04:33.490> always

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
sweat and you can print some out always

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.670 
sweat and you can print some out always
so<00:04:33.820> I'd<00:04:33.940> say<00:04:34.120> print<00:04:34.389> bring<00:04:34.660> two<00:04:34.810> pairs<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.110> at

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
so I'd say print bring two pairs of at

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.290 
so I'd say print bring two pairs of at
least<00:04:35.800> two<00:04:36.009> pairs<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.250> socks<00:04:36.400> if<00:04:36.940> you're<00:04:37.120> going

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
least two pairs of socks if you're going

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.420 
least two pairs of socks if you're going
out<00:04:37.419> there<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:38.380> next<00:04:38.620> thing<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.979> rain

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
out there the next thing is rain

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.040 
out there the next thing is rain
protection<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.240> got<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.810> think<00:04:40.840> about

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
protection so you got to think about

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.050 
protection so you got to think about
this<00:04:41.259> if<00:04:41.410> there's<00:04:41.560> going<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.800> rain<00:04:42.060> you're

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
this if there's going to be rain you're

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.159 
this if there's going to be rain you're
going<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.240> want<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.479> have<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.630> jacket<00:04:43.960> so

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
going to want to have a jacket so

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.960 
going to want to have a jacket so
there's<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.380> couple<00:04:44.500> options<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.160> can<00:04:45.850> have

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
there's a couple options you can have

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.810 
there's a couple options you can have
some<00:04:46.120> really<00:04:46.300> simple<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.169> know<00:04:47.259> this<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.820> not

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
some really simple you know this is not

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.340 
some really simple you know this is not
necessary<00:04:49.240> back<00:04:49.510> back<00:04:49.690> in<00:04:49.840> here<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.199> is

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
necessary back back in here but this is

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.870 
necessary back back in here but this is
something<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:50.860> will<00:04:51.070> at<00:04:51.160> least<00:04:51.190> repel<00:04:51.669> water

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
something that will at least repel water

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.840 
something that will at least repel water
it's<00:04:52.240> cheaper<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.500> put<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.800> on<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.280> stay

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
it's cheaper and put it on and stay

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.719 
it's cheaper and put it on and stay
relatively<00:04:55.750> dry<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:57.010> other<00:04:57.160> thing<00:04:57.430> would<00:04:57.550> be

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
relatively dry the other thing would be

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.810 
relatively dry the other thing would be
a<00:04:57.760> cover<00:04:58.270> for<00:04:58.570> your<00:04:58.720> pack<00:04:58.960> if<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.350> can<00:04:59.820> poncho
