00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello babies I'm in the mobile world 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.490
 congress of barcelona and this in the area 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.059
 of are and to tell you a little bit like 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.740
 is the sony xperia beta 2 a first 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.940
 contact where I will tell you which ones 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.190
 are its characteristics and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:27.720
 most relevant differences with respect 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:32.009
 to the previous generation then here 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 they were 52 inches with full resolution 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.180
 hd technology that lit up as they already had 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.340
 previous models and that is integrating 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 sony in practically all his 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 devices and at least in the part 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 front we already have a difference with 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.770
 with respect to the previous model and is the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.289
 stereo sound in the center we have 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 12 speakers in addition on the front 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.850
 a speaker here and another speaker here for 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 get a better sound but it's that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.000
 They have also put something new with 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 regarding audio and that is that 30 2 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.950
 Supports noise cancellation 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 with this technology what we have to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 use are special headphones 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.479
 have that noise cancellation in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.010
 this case not only sony has presented 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.510
 these headphones but those 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.920
 headphones at least in Spain- in 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.350
 the rest of the countries have not been able to 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 confirm include headphones 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.210
 directly with the device the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.910
 loose headphones cost 60 euros 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.250
 so you know but as I say 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.190
 would be available directly in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.830
 box these headphones what they have are 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.710
 two microphones a microphone that is the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.649
 that receives the signal from outside the audio 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 the outside waves and what they do is that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.399
 pass through the smartphone and the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.100
 smartphone is interpreted by the smartphone 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.960
 what it does in turn is to send 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.940
 counterdirection waves for 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.410
 counteract the waves of the audio that 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.880
 they were entering us with which the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.190
 sound is canceled 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 the sound of course it's noise is 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.090
 say the one we do not want it to be so 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.950
 both the mini jack to see if we have the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.990
 possibility and I can teach you it would be 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.539
 different instead of being 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.720
 strips with three connectors would have 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.640
 five connectors for this mission in 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.989
 principle they have talked about that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.580
 yes but it would be compatible with others 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.050
 included in our technology and the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.450
 truth is that it is quite enough 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.790
 interesting especially that a given their 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.440
 headphones of that quality can come 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.319
 directly with a smartphone something 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.970
 quite new that more things we have 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.410
 in the back what we would have 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.880
 it would be the same glass finish as the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.709
 previous model in fact the aspect is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 quite similar and of course in 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.340
 these clinics we have the camera of 20 7 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.010
 megapixels that is exactly the same 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.989
 camera than the z1 but there is a difference 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.269
 quite important between the camera the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.890
 z1 and the camera of this z 2 the one 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.920
 software improvement to have the best 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.470
 photographic quality but also eye to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 this to be able to record with this camera 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.360
 in 4k format 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.720
 so then we can reproduce what 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.849
 We are calling on the smartphone 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.140
 example on a 4k television that they are 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.569
 right now it's going for the whole market 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.780
 but soon they will fall in price by 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.140
 inside qualcomm snapdragon processor 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.480
 801 from 4 cores to 2.3 gigahertz 3 gb 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.829
 of ram memory and 16 gb of storage 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.829
 that can be expanded up to 64 gigs 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.170
 using the card slot 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.150
 microsd that we have here that the 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.109
 tapitas will ring true for themselves because 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.739
 this cited is also resistant to 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:40.519
 water and dust if we put it in this 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.950
 lateral and we discover the cap we see 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.579
 here that has the microusb connection and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.709
 we have here the hard one for the cards 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.659
 microsim on this other side we had 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.150
 also the minijack connection that would be 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.099
 hydrophobic because this contact with 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.500
 water would not enter the water to the device 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.870
 directly over here and of course and 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.670
 keeping the hesperia style 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.800
 still having here although in tiny 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.960
 of its design highlight 82 millimeters 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.270
 of thickness that is practically the same 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.650
 thickness that the camera occupies and this because 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.480
 I'm telling you because we have a video 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.730
 interesting mark of how is the camera 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.650
 only the camera but good ahead 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.940
 nothing more simply comment that 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.310
 The screen has also been adjusted 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.020
 little bit more to the edges to be able 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.080
 get a screen a little bit more 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.080
 big 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.530
 so 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.930
 nothing more three thousand 200 thousand pawns of 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.330
 Battery was not forgotten to give 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.370
 a great autonomy as I had the z1 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.160
 so let's hope and even though I still do not 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.690
 we have tested in conditions that follow 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.120
 having at least the same autonomy 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.470
 who had the cedaw with this will be a 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.690
 first contact as soon as we can 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.850
 put your hands on it we will do the 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.380
 corresponding videogram and have in 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.150
 notice that the device starts to 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.000
 market in March still not 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.400
 know the price but it is assumed that 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.870
 have the same starting price as the 31 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.940
 at the time when we see each other in the 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.030
 next program 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.030
 ah
