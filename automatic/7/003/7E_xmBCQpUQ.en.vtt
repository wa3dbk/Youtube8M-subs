00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.300 
was a bit of a tight squeeze since this
was<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> sock<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.520> when<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.850> littler<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
was a sock from when I was littler and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
was a sock from when I was littler and
it<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> shows<00:01:57.450> through<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.290> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it kind of shows through a little bit in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
it kind of shows through a little bit in
overall<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> huge<00:01:59.700> fan<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
overall I'm not a huge fan of this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
overall I'm not a huge fan of this
I<00:02:00.649> might<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.570> kind<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:04.070> get<00:02:05.070> rid<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.460> one

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I might just kind of get rid of this one

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
I might just kind of get rid of this one
because<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.329> mean<00:02:07.290> save<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:07.950> stuff

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
because I mean save it for other stuff

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
because I mean save it for other stuff
but<00:02:08.429> basically<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.090> rid<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.660> it's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
but basically get rid of it because it's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.550 
but basically get rid of it because it's
not<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:11.790> doesn't<00:02:12.180> look<00:02:12.330> good<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
not it doesn't look good so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050 
not it doesn't look good so

look but I'm going to focus on the
sleeves<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.340> now<00:02:47.489> now<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> do<00:02:48.299> recommend

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
sleeves right now now I do recommend

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.840 
sleeves right now now I do recommend
doing<00:02:49.200> sleeves<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.860> an<00:02:49.980> American<00:02:50.370> Girl<00:02:50.549> sense

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
doing sleeves on an American Girl sense

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.940 
doing sleeves on an American Girl sense
a<00:02:51.180> sleeveless<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.470> falls<00:02:52.860> down

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
a sleeveless just just falls down

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.780 
a sleeveless just just falls down
basically<00:02:53.610> um<00:02:54.470> unless<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:55.890> cut<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.580> at<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
basically um unless you like cut it at a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.940 
basically um unless you like cut it at a
slant<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.840> there's<00:02:58.019> part<00:02:58.319> up<00:02:58.470> here<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
slant so that there's part up here and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.949 
slant so that there's part up here and
then<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.190> goes<00:02:59.310> down<00:02:59.370> I'd<00:03:00.360> recommend<00:03:00.900> doing

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
then it goes down I'd recommend doing

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.080 
then it goes down I'd recommend doing
sleeves<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.280> sleeve<00:03:02.610> or<00:03:02.849> two

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
sleeves so you can do one sleeve or two

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.789 
sleeves so you can do one sleeve or two
sleeves<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.630> way<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:04.080> about<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.590> show<00:03:04.739> you

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
sleeves in the way I'm about to show you

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.309 
sleeves in the way I'm about to show you
right<00:03:05.040> now<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:05.849> it's<00:03:06.030> sometimes<00:03:06.690> easier<00:03:07.170> if

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
right now now it's sometimes easier if

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.620 
right now now it's sometimes easier if
you<00:03:07.410> take<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.830> sock<00:03:08.099> off<00:03:08.340> your<00:03:08.610> doll<00:03:08.849> when<00:03:09.599> you

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you take the sock off your doll when you

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.770 
you take the sock off your doll when you
do<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.410> basically<00:03:10.819> just<00:03:11.819> find<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.510> spot

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
do this but basically just find a spot

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.930 
do this but basically just find a spot
where<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.140> want<00:03:13.349> your<00:03:13.530> sleeve<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.040> be<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.400> cut

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
where you want your sleeve to be and cut

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.820 
where you want your sleeve to be and cut
a<00:03:14.970> little<00:03:15.150> hole<00:03:15.450> remember<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.620> always

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
a little hole remember you can always

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.349 
a little hole remember you can always
make<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.280> bigger<00:03:17.489> but<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.820> can't<00:03:18.090> make<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
make it bigger but you can't make it

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.390 
make it bigger but you can't make it
smaller<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.930> make<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.470> pretty<00:03:19.769> small<00:03:20.010> at<00:03:20.130> first

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
smaller so make it pretty small at first

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.979 
smaller so make it pretty small at first
then<00:03:20.640> if<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> need<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> enlarge<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.600> do<00:03:21.810> that

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
then if you need to enlarge it do that

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.060 
then if you need to enlarge it do that
now<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> personally<00:03:23.459> love<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.510> style<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.950> you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
now I personally love this style but you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.500 
now I personally love this style but you
may<00:03:26.190> want<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.850> other<00:03:26.970> side<00:03:27.269> to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
may want to do it on the other side to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.090 
may want to do it on the other side to
just<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:27.900> two<00:03:28.109> straps<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> think<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:28.950> might

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
just have two straps and I think I might

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.530 
just have two straps and I think I might
try<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.700> might<00:03:29.850> look<00:03:30.000> cute<00:03:30.239> with<00:03:30.420> this

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
try that that might look cute with this

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.809 
try that that might look cute with this
dress<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.709> actually<00:03:31.950> does<00:03:32.370> look<00:03:32.549> very

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
dress now this actually does look very

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.660
