00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
there's a call there's another call we

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.859 
there's a call there's another call we
go<00:00:27.570> 3-way<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.250> button<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.970> 1511

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
go 3-way to it and the button is a 1511

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.340 
go 3-way to it and the button is a 1511
over<00:00:31.250> 447<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> three-bed<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.000> 3%<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
over 447 with a three-bed of 3% and the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.850 
over 447 with a three-bed of 3% and the
big<00:00:34.500> blind<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> fishy<00:00:35.610> 42<00:00:36.270> 15<00:00:36.780> over<00:00:37.140> 73

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
big blind is the fishy 42 15 over 73

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.299 
big blind is the fishy 42 15 over 73
with<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> 3-bit<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.329> 0%<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
with a 3-bit of 0% so we all go to the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.209 
with a 3-bit of 0% so we all go to the
flop<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.390> face<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.840> min<00:00:43.440> bet<00:00:43.680> from<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> big

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
flop and we face a min bet from the big

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.840 
flop and we face a min bet from the big
blind

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
blind

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
blind
so<00:00:45.090> even<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.660> didn't<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> HUD<00:00:46.590> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
so even if we didn't have the HUD in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.229 
so even if we didn't have the HUD in
this<00:00:46.920> situation<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.640> would<00:00:47.670> still<00:00:48.059> probably

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this situation I would still probably

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
this situation I would still probably
assume<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> big<00:00:49.289> blind<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
assume that the big blind that's not a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.250 
assume that the big blind that's not a
great<00:00:50.250> player<00:00:50.640> he<00:00:51.420> started<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> hand<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
great player he started the hand with a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
great player he started the hand with a
half<00:00:52.500> stack<00:00:52.860> he's<00:00:53.190> mid<00:00:53.550> docking<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
half stack he's mid docking in a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.000 
half stack he's mid docking in a
multi-way<00:00:54.750> part<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.379> pretty<00:00:55.680> silly

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
multi-way part which is a pretty silly

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
multi-way part which is a pretty silly
thing<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.420> assuming<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> he's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
thing to do so I'm assuming that he's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
thing to do so I'm assuming that he's
probably<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.410> gonna<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> great<00:00:58.859> even<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
probably not gonna be great even if I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
probably not gonna be great even if I
didn't<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> HUD<00:01:00.300> numbers<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> confirm

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
didn't have the HUD numbers to confirm

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
didn't have the HUD numbers to confirm
that<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> exact<00:01:02.430> situation<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that but in this exact situation when I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
that but in this exact situation when I
have<00:01:03.600> something<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.530> over<00:01:04.769> pair<00:01:05.010> against

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
have something like an over pair against

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.160 
have something like an over pair against
a<00:01:05.400> half<00:01:05.580> stack<00:01:05.880> fish<00:01:06.180> more<00:01:06.630> often<00:01:06.990> than<00:01:07.140> not

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
a half stack fish more often than not

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
a half stack fish more often than not
I'm<00:01:07.500> trying<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> create<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> big<00:01:08.490> pot<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.030> very

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
I'm trying to create a big pot very very

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.140 
I'm trying to create a big pot very very
quickly<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.860> decide<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> raise<00:01:11.790> here

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
quickly so I would decide to raise here

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
quickly so I would decide to raise here
just<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.540> hero<00:01:12.810> did<00:01:13.080> hero<00:01:13.439> chose<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> raise<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just like hero did hero chose a raise of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
just like hero did hero chose a raise of
214<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.840> size<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.350> totally

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
214 and I think that size is totally

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.910 
214 and I think that size is totally
totally<00:01:17.070> fine<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.509> button<00:01:19.110> could<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.710> course

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
totally fine the button could of course

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
totally fine the button could of course
have<00:01:20.070> hit<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.520> board<00:01:20.790> occasionally<00:01:21.360> there

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
have hit this board occasionally there

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
have hit this board occasionally there
certainly<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.110> ways<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.830> him<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
certainly are some ways for him to do so

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.240 
certainly are some ways for him to do so
so<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.150> pairs<00:01:24.420> etc<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.590> ultimately<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so that's two pairs etc but ultimately I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
so that's two pairs etc but ultimately I
think<00:01:26.340> he's<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.820> play<00:01:27.000> pretty<00:01:27.540> straight<00:01:28.020> up

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
think he's gonna play pretty straight up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
think he's gonna play pretty straight up
and<00:01:28.350> straight<00:01:28.530> forward<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.220> situation

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and straight forward in this situation

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
and straight forward in this situation
and<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.450> don't<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> call<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.560> give

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and I don't really want to call and give

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
and I don't really want to call and give
him<00:01:31.829> an<00:01:31.890> insane<00:01:32.369> price<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.939> take<00:01:33.119> position

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
him an insane price to take position

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.539 
him an insane price to take position
call<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> entirety<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> his<00:01:34.950> range<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
call with the entirety of his range and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.399 
call with the entirety of his range and
let<00:01:35.909> him<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> ways<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.229> don't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
let him get there in ways that I don't

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
let him get there in ways that I don't
want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.860> let<00:01:38.280> him<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.759> for

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
want to let him get there for

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.749 
want to let him get there for
essentially<00:01:39.570> free<00:01:39.900> because<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> view<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.220> single

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
essentially free because I view a single

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
essentially free because I view a single
big<00:01:41.909> blind<00:01:42.119> essentially<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.750> free<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
big blind essentially as free in this

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
big blind essentially as free in this
spot<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> button<00:01:44.939> does<00:01:45.060> decide<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> fold

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
spot but the button does decide to fold

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
spot but the button does decide to fold
big<00:01:46.229> blind<00:01:46.439> decides<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.040> shove<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.270> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
big blind decides to shove and here we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.920 
big blind decides to shove and here we
are

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
are

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
are
so<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> exact<00:01:49.860> situation<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.759> should

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so in this exact situation we should

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760 
so in this exact situation we should
have<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.750> planning<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.500> it's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
have kind of been planning for this it's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
have kind of been planning for this it's
very<00:01:52.829> realistic<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.970> he<00:01:54.240> could<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.689> jamming

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
very realistic that he could be jamming

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
very realistic that he could be jamming
a<00:01:55.350> majority<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> his<00:01:56.219> hands<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.299> can

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
a majority of his hands here and we can

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
a majority of his hands here and we can
actually<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:58.229> about<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.740> ahead<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.310> as

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
actually think about this ahead but as

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310 
actually think about this ahead but as
played<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.450> should<00:02:00.630> definitely<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.200> least

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
played we should definitely be at least

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.170 
played we should definitely be at least
studying<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.250> table<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.030> make

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
studying this off the table just to make

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.569 
studying this off the table just to make
sure<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> good<00:02:04.140> call<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.399> at

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
sure that we make a good call here so at

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
sure that we make a good call here so at
this<00:02:05.700> point<00:02:05.880> we're<00:02:06.060> getting<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.390> point<00:02:06.630> seven

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
this point we're getting one point seven

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.999 
this point we're getting one point seven
and<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> call<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.829> need<00:02:07.920> at

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and one on the call and you need at

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
and one on the call and you need at
least<00:02:08.039> thirty<00:02:08.580> seven<00:02:08.910> percent<00:02:09.000> equity<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
least thirty seven percent equity to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.449 
least thirty seven percent equity to
break-even<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> pull<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
break-even so we can do is pull out a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.930 
break-even so we can do is pull out a
cool

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
cool

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.630 
cool
and<00:02:12.210> get<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> work<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.740> we<00:02:13.920> plug<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> board

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and get to work so we plug in the board

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.670 
and get to work so we plug in the board
we<00:02:14.970> plug<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.270> our<00:02:15.360> hands<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> now<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.440> just

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
we plug in our hands and now we just

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.980 
we plug in our hands and now we just
need<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.950> assign<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.490> range<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.600> big<00:02:18.780> blind

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
need to assign a range for the big blind

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.770 
need to assign a range for the big blind
so<00:02:19.920> let's<00:02:20.160> give<00:02:20.310> him<00:02:20.400> some<00:02:21.030> sets

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
so let's give him some sets

so let's give him some sets

suited and let's also give him some

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.110 
suited and let's also give him some
slate<00:02:37.380> over<00:02:37.650> pairs<00:02:37.890> right<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.550> possible

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
slate over pairs right it is possible

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.730 
slate over pairs right it is possible
that<00:02:39.300> he<00:02:39.480> did<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.900> call<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.320> these<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
that he did just call with these and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.220 
that he did just call with these and
would<00:02:40.890> overvalue<00:02:41.550> them<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.000> board<00:02:42.330> 107

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
would overvalue them on this board 107

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.950 
would overvalue them on this board 107
makes<00:02:43.380> sense<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.920> also<00:02:44.760> want<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.300> add<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.750> some

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
makes sense I also want to add in some

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.630 
makes sense I also want to add in some
flush<00:02:46.410> draws<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.890> make<00:02:47.040> sense<00:02:47.280> now<00:02:47.580> he

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
flush draws that make sense now he

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270 
flush draws that make sense now he
cannot<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.930> flush<00:02:49.560> draw<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> King

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
cannot have a flush draw with the King

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.800 
cannot have a flush draw with the King
of<00:02:50.460> clubs<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.240> had<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> king<00:02:51.690> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
of clubs because we had the king of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570 
of clubs because we had the king of
clubs<00:02:51.960> in<00:02:52.200> our<00:02:52.320> hand<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.430> give

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
clubs in our hand but we can just give

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.900 
clubs in our hand but we can just give
him<00:02:53.820> all<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.600> these<00:02:54.780> things<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.310> actually

him all of these things and actually

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.520 
him all of these things and actually
those<00:02:57.090> don't<00:02:57.390> make<00:02:57.570> sense<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:58.110> he<00:02:58.230> cannot

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
those don't make sense because he cannot

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.780 
those don't make sense because he cannot
have<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.860> eight<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> clubs<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
have the eight of clubs because the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.820 
have the eight of clubs because the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.580 
click suit selection again than clubs
then<00:03:08.280> okay<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.870> think<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.350> pretty

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
then okay and I think this is a pretty

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.010 
then okay and I think this is a pretty
realistic<00:03:11.130> range<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.330> hands<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.690> he<00:03:12.840> could

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
realistic range of hands that he could

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.810 
realistic range of hands that he could
be<00:03:13.170> jamming<00:03:13.590> here<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.250> noticed<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.670> we

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
be jamming here and you noticed that we

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.720 
be jamming here and you noticed that we
have<00:03:15.000> plenty<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.900> equity<00:03:16.470> against<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.070> we<00:03:17.550> can

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
have plenty of equity against it we can

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.300 
have plenty of equity against it we can
definitely<00:03:18.120> make<00:03:18.210> a<00:03:18.270> profitable<00:03:18.780> call<00:03:19.310> now

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
definitely make a profitable call now

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.440 
definitely make a profitable call now
you<00:03:20.370> notice<00:03:20.670> when<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.850> was<00:03:20.940> building<00:03:21.210> this<00:03:21.300> I

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
you notice when I was building this I

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.060 
you notice when I was building this I
was<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:21.810> only<00:03:21.930> throwing<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.620> suited

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
was really only throwing in like suited

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.370 
was really only throwing in like suited
combos<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.970> things<00:03:24.210> we<00:03:24.960> could<00:03:25.200> definitely

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
combos of things we could definitely

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.950 
combos of things we could definitely
throw<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.130> some<00:03:26.370> offsuit<00:03:26.730> combos<00:03:27.240> if<00:03:27.540> he<00:03:27.810> is

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
throw in some offsuit combos if he is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960 
throw in some offsuit combos if he is
fishy<00:03:28.260> these<00:03:28.650> could<00:03:28.950> definitely<00:03:29.190> make<00:03:29.580> sense

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
fishy these could definitely make sense

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.410 
fishy these could definitely make sense
so<00:03:30.300> let's<00:03:30.450> throw<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.930> these<00:03:31.160> throwing<00:03:32.160> that's

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
so let's throw in these throwing that's

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.790 
so let's throw in these throwing that's
really<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.570> tit<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.320> notice<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.680> we

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
really a tit and you notice that we

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800 
really a tit and you notice that we
still<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.340> plenty<00:03:35.850> enough<00:03:36.150> equity<00:03:36.480> to

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
still have plenty enough equity to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.530 
still have plenty enough equity to
justify<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.530> call<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.820> whenever<00:03:39.270> I'm<00:03:39.420> doing

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
justify this call so whenever I'm doing

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.420 
justify this call so whenever I'm doing
this<00:03:39.750> kind<00:03:39.960> of<00:03:40.050> math<00:03:40.170> off<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.650> table<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.160> always

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
this kind of math off the table I always

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.680 
this kind of math off the table I always
like<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.700> run<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.060> couple<00:03:42.270> different<00:03:42.450> ways

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
like to run it a couple different ways

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.110 
like to run it a couple different ways
run<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.650> against<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> worst<00:03:44.250> case<00:03:44.490> range<00:03:44.790> a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
run it against the worst case range a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
run it against the worst case range a
best<00:03:45.330> case<00:03:45.480> range<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:46.170> medium<00:03:46.560> range<00:03:46.800> and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
best case range a medium range and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.160 
best case range a medium range and
you're<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.120> doing<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.480> really<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:48.930> more

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
you're just doing it really to get more

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.030 
you're just doing it really to get more
reps<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.370> you're<00:03:50.700> able<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.180> kind<00:03:51.480> of

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
reps so that you're able to kind of

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.590 
reps so that you're able to kind of
understand<00:03:53.040> equity<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.670> eyeball<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.240> easier

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
understand equity and eyeball it easier

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.330 
understand equity and eyeball it easier
and<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:54.960> you're<00:03:55.290> able<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.710> actually<00:03:56.040> use<00:03:56.310> it

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and that you're able to actually use it

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.910 
and that you're able to actually use it
in<00:03:56.520> real<00:03:56.760> time<00:03:57.060> because<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:58.110> ability<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.710> be

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
in real time because the ability to be

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.800 
in real time because the ability to be
able<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.250> quickly<00:03:59.730> estimate<00:04:00.120> your<00:04:00.510> equity

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
able to quickly estimate your equity

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.200 
able to quickly estimate your equity
against<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.290> realistic<00:04:01.800> range<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.370> then<00:04:02.970> make

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
against a realistic range and then make

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.970 
against a realistic range and then make
better<00:04:03.540> mathematical<00:04:04.290> decisions<00:04:04.740> on<00:04:04.860> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
better mathematical decisions on the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.030 
better mathematical decisions on the
table<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> huge<00:04:06.420> huge<00:04:06.810> huge<00:04:07.050> skill<00:04:07.440> set<00:04:07.710> and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
table is a huge huge huge skill set and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.680 
table is a huge huge huge skill set and
something<00:04:08.520> you<00:04:08.580> want<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.850> constantly<00:04:09.330> be

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
something you want to constantly be

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.020 
something you want to constantly be
working<00:04:09.870> towards<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.890> overall<00:04:11.520> definitely

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
working towards so overall definitely

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.390 
working towards so overall definitely
wanna<00:04:12.330> be<00:04:12.510> calling<00:04:12.930> here<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.410> here<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.220> does

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
wanna be calling here and here it does

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.280 
wanna be calling here and here it does
and<00:04:14.760> unfortunately<00:04:15.600> ends<00:04:15.720> up<00:04:15.870> pointing<00:04:16.140> into

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
and unfortunately ends up pointing into

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.140 
and unfortunately ends up pointing into
the<00:04:16.380> two<00:04:16.560> pair<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.310> then<00:04:17.670> again<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:17.910> was

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
the two pair but then again that was

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.940 
the two pair but then again that was
built<00:04:18.390> into<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.690> equation<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.500> know<00:04:19.590> even

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
built into the equation you know even

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.710 
built into the equation you know even
against

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
against

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.390 
against
range<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.110> had<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.530> kind<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.829> stuff<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.250> it

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
range that had that kind of stuff in it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.580 
range that had that kind of stuff in it
a<00:04:22.610> realistic<00:04:23.330> range<00:04:23.780> against<00:04:24.170> this<00:04:24.260> kind<00:04:24.470> of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
a realistic range against this kind of

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.950 
a realistic range against this kind of
opponent<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.340> definitely<00:04:26.120> still<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.810> be<00:04:26.930> a

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
opponent it definitely still to be a

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.080 
opponent it definitely still to be a
very<00:04:27.290> profitable<00:04:27.620> call<00:04:28.220> definitely<00:04:28.790> not

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
very profitable call definitely not

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.360 
very profitable call definitely not
gonna<00:04:29.240> fault<00:04:29.540> hero<00:04:29.840> at<00:04:30.020> all<00:04:30.110> for<00:04:30.410> this<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.340> I
