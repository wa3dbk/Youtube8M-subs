million our 55k mining per hour and it's

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.680 
million our 55k mining per hour and it's
uh<00:00:07.529> actually<00:00:08.280> pretty<00:00:08.519> enjoyable<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.210> mean<00:00:09.480> it

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
uh actually pretty enjoyable I mean it

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
isn't the most fun thing ever but it

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.940 
isn't the most fun thing ever but it
isn't<00:00:12.120> like<00:00:12.450> extremely<00:00:13.080> boring<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.620> might<00:00:13.830> be

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
isn't like extremely boring it might be

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.589 
isn't like extremely boring it might be
a<00:00:13.980> little<00:00:14.160> clique<00:00:14.700> intensive<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> few

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
a little clique intensive for a few

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230 
a little clique intensive for a few
people<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.070> method<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.970> did

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
people but I like this method and I did

people but I like this method and I did
do<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.600> method<00:00:18.960> back<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> day<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070

wanted to show you guys how to do this

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.380 
wanted to show you guys how to do this
thing<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.439> let's<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.160> into<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> first<00:00:24.090> things

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
first you guys need to know before you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
first you guys need to know before you
even<00:00:26.160> attempt<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> guide<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> few

even attempt this guide there are a few
items<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.560> you're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> need<00:00:29.099> which

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
items that you're going to need which

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.420 
items that you're going to need which
require<00:00:30.109> different<00:00:31.109> stats<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:32.340> get

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
require different stats and let's get

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
require different stats and let's get
into<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.120> first<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.930> need

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
into that so first up you do need

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.900 
into that so first up you do need
porters<00:00:34.649> well<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> don't<00:00:35.340> need<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.760> they

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
porters well you don't need them they

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
porters well you don't need them they
just<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.450> increase<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.370> money<00:00:38.370> per

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
just really increase the the money per

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
just really increase the the money per
hour<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.510> long<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.960> stay<00:00:40.140> there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
hour and how long you can stay there

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
hour and how long you can stay there
because<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.190> automatically<00:00:41.760> Bank<00:00:42.030> your

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
because they automatically Bank your

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
because they automatically Bank your
stuff<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.719> don't<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> sign<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
stuff if you don't know what the sign of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
stuff if you don't know what the sign of
the<00:00:44.280> porter<00:00:44.579> kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> things<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> they're

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the porter kind of things do and they're

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
the porter kind of things do and they're
not<00:00:46.379> tradable<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.430> need<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> level<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
not tradable so you do need the level to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.400 
not tradable so you do need the level to
make<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.200> into

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
make them I'm not going to go into

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
make them I'm not going to go into
detail<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.340> each<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
detail like how to make each because you

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
detail like how to make each because you
can<00:00:51.390> look<00:00:51.539> at<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> divination<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> thing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
can look at the divination kind of thing

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
can look at the divination kind of thing
but<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.039> recommend<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.239> least<00:00:54.270> 48

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
but I do recommend to have at least 48

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.250 
but I do recommend to have at least 48
divination<00:00:55.489> for<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> tier<00:00:57.030> 3<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
divination for the tier 3 because that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
divination for the tier 3 because that
starts<00:00:58.590> where<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.190> getting<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.550> little

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
starts where it's getting a little

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020 
starts where it's getting a little
cheaper<00:01:00.329> per<00:01:01.109> teleport<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:02.039> example<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
cheaper per teleport for example the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.289 
cheaper per teleport for example the
level<00:01:03.329> 68<00:01:03.780> tier<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.799> 250<00:01:05.670> per<00:01:05.820> teleport

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
level 68 tier is like 250 per teleport

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.620 
level 68 tier is like 250 per teleport
in<00:01:06.450> terms<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> GP<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.700> level<00:01:08.939> 88<00:01:09.240> 1

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
in terms of GP and then the level 88 1

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.000 
in terms of GP and then the level 88 1
which<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.770> making

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
which is the one I'm going to be making

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.039 
which is the one I'm going to be making
is<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.930> 145<00:01:12.930> per<00:01:13.260> teleport<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.760> tier<00:01:15.600> 5<00:01:15.840> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
is a 145 per teleport so the tier 5 is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.260 
is a 145 per teleport so the tier 5 is
actually<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.650> cheapest<00:01:17.070> per<00:01:17.250> teleport<00:01:17.729> but

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
actually the cheapest per teleport but

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.410 
actually the cheapest per teleport but
each<00:01:18.630> tier<00:01:19.080> has<00:01:19.860> more<00:01:20.220> teleport<00:01:20.759> charges<00:01:21.240> on

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
each tier has more teleport charges on

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
each tier has more teleport charges on
each<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.110> technically<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.830> stay

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
each one so you technically you can stay

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.310 
each one so you technically you can stay
longer<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.790> higher<00:01:23.970> tier<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
longer if you have a higher tier but I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.770 
longer if you have a higher tier but I
do<00:01:25.560> recommend<00:01:26.009> using<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> tier<00:01:26.909> 5<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> do

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
do recommend using the tier 5 if you do

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.249 
do recommend using the tier 5 if you do
have<00:01:27.990> 88<00:01:28.290> divination<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.520> again<00:01:30.420> 48<00:01:31.049> or

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
have 88 divination but again 48 or

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.499 
have 88 divination but again 48 or
higher<00:01:31.439> could<00:01:31.920> work<00:01:32.189> pretty<00:01:32.640> easily<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.420> if

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
higher could work pretty easily so if

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.910 
higher could work pretty easily so if
you<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.840> how<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you don't know how to make them you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
you don't know how to make them you
basically<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.790> divination<00:01:36.150> energy<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
basically have the divination energy and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.410 
basically have the divination energy and

I'm just going to make five while I do
this<00:01:48.030> video<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> first<00:01:49.770> type<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
this video but that is the first type of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
this video but that is the first type of
item<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> need<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.360> this

item that you're going to need for this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
item that you're going to need for this
and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> next<00:01:52.500> item<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.979> going

and then the next item that you're going

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.600 
and then the next item that you're going
to<00:01:53.159> need

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to need

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.429 
to need
well<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.240> necessarily<00:01:54.479> need<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
well you don't necessarily need them it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.190 
well you don't necessarily need them it
just<00:01:55.649> increases<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.340> experience<00:01:56.850> per<00:01:56.969> hour

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
just increases the experience per hour

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.330 
just increases the experience per hour
significantly<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.469> actually<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:58.979> 20

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
significantly it's actually about 20

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
significantly it's actually about 20
percent<00:01:59.700> because<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.420> do

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
percent because that's what they do

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.959 
percent because that's what they do
and<00:02:00.780> those<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.740> mining<00:02:02.460> urns<00:02:02.640> so

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
and those are the mining urns so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
and those are the mining urns so
definitely<00:02:03.659> make<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> decorated<00:02:04.710> ones<00:02:04.890> if

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
definitely make the decorated ones if

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.020 
definitely make the decorated ones if
you're<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.310> make<00:02:05.430> these<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you're going to make these and that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570 
you're going to make these and that
requires<00:02:06.450> 59<00:02:07.049> crafting<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.680> again<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.550> are

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
requires 59 crafting and again they are

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.400 
requires 59 crafting and again they are
not<00:02:08.849> tradable<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> make<00:02:10.259> them

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
not tradable so you do have to make them

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.619 
not tradable so you do have to make them
yourself<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.180> whole<00:02:12.270> different

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
yourself but that's a whole different

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.699 
yourself but that's a whole different

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
can get ready for granite mining I

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.619 
can get ready for granite mining I
summon<00:03:32.310> my<00:03:32.430> lava<00:03:32.609> tite<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:32.879> don't<00:03:33.150> forget<00:03:33.449> to

wearing and then you have nine urns so
it's<00:03:45.359> like<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.750> perfect<00:03:45.780> ratio<00:03:46.319> use<00:03:47.159> all<00:03:47.400> of

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
it's like the perfect ratio use all of

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.369 
it's like the perfect ratio use all of
them<00:03:47.669> up<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:47.970> pretty<00:03:48.659> close<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.019> all<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.259> them

them up or pretty close to all of them
up<00:03:49.500> together<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.849> way<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.060> don't<00:03:51.299> like

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:51.509 
up together and that way you don't like

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.569 
up together and that way you don't like
waste<00:03:51.780> time<00:03:52.079> or<00:03:52.319> waste<00:03:52.590> inventory<00:03:53.129> space<00:03:53.340> kind

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
waste time or waste inventory space kind

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
so let's go to the granite area I'll

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.280 
so let's go to the granite area I'll
show<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.090> guys<00:04:03.209> how<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.449> get<00:04:03.659> there<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.169> get

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
there all you do is you run south of the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.729 
there all you do is you run south of the
bandit<00:04:06.150> lodestone<00:04:06.569> as<00:04:06.689> you<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:06.959> see<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.349> then

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
bandit lodestone as you can see and then

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.289 
bandit lodestone as you can see and then
move<00:04:07.949> a<00:04:08.040> little<00:04:08.220> bit<00:04:08.430> west<00:04:08.669> and<00:04:09.000> you'll<00:04:09.180> be

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
right there so looking around there's a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.099 
right there so looking around there's a
bunch<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.669> sandstone<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.449> granite<00:04:12.750> rocks

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
bunch of sandstone and granite rocks

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.110 
bunch of sandstone and granite rocks
don't<00:04:13.919> worry<00:04:14.099> about<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.370> sandstone<00:04:14.759> it's<00:04:15.000> not

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
don't worry about the sandstone it's not

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.490 
don't worry about the sandstone it's not
really<00:04:15.299> profitable<00:04:15.750> we're<00:04:16.049> here<00:04:16.259> for<00:04:16.409> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
really profitable we're here for the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.800 
really profitable we're here for the
granite<00:04:16.889> there's<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.340> few<00:04:17.519> spots<00:04:17.729> here<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.509> mine

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
granite there's a few spots here to mine

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.449 
granite there's a few spots here to mine
there's<00:04:19.289> one<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> northern<00:04:20.159> side<00:04:20.400> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
there's one on the northern side and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.159 
there's one on the northern side and
then<00:04:20.759> there's<00:04:21.000> one<00:04:21.180> on<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.389> western<00:04:21.690> side<00:04:21.900> you

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
then there's one on the western side you

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.930 
then there's one on the western side you
can<00:04:22.289> do<00:04:22.409> either<00:04:22.590> one<00:04:22.919> but<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.370> feel<00:04:23.639> that<00:04:23.669> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
can do either one but I feel that the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.550 
can do either one but I feel that the
western<00:04:24.300> side<00:04:24.539> is<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.779> little<00:04:25.229> bit

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
western side is a little bit

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.140 
western side is a little bit
because<00:04:25.950> they<00:04:26.100> have<00:04:26.310> four<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:27.030> them<00:04:27.120> right

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
because they have four of them right

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.570 
because they have four of them right
next<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.810> each<00:04:27.930> other<00:04:28.050> without<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.650> having

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
next to each other without like having

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.030 
next to each other without like having
you<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.790> like<00:04:30.000> loop<00:04:30.330> around<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.919> other

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
you to like loop around but the other

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.340 
you to like loop around but the other
one<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.340> also<00:04:32.490> good<00:04:32.790> if<00:04:32.970> like<00:04:33.300> both<00:04:33.900> spots<00:04:34.169> are

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
one is also good if like both spots are

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.560 
one is also good if like both spots are
taken<00:04:34.380> but<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:35.010> sure<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.940> really<00:04:36.240> doesn't

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
taken but for sure it really doesn't

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.530 
taken but for sure it really doesn't
take<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.750> long<00:04:36.930> for<00:04:37.470> them<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.620> respawn<00:04:38.100> and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
take that long for them to respawn and

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.210 
take that long for them to respawn and
if<00:04:39.540> they<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.840> take<00:04:40.169> a<00:04:40.200> long<00:04:40.470> time<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.860> respond

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
if they do take a long time to respond

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.670 
if they do take a long time to respond
for<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:42.330> hop<00:04:42.450> onto<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.750> more<00:04:43.230> populated

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
for you just hop onto a more populated

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.650 
for you just hop onto a more populated
world<00:04:44.010> like<00:04:44.310> world<00:04:44.880> two<00:04:45.090> or<00:04:45.240> something<00:04:45.540> and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
world like world two or something and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.720 
world like world two or something and
you<00:04:45.750> will<00:04:45.870> make<00:04:46.050> technically<00:04:46.770> more<00:04:46.980> money<00:04:47.160> but

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
you will make technically more money but

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.790 
you will make technically more money but
it<00:04:48.240> might<00:04:48.419> be<00:04:48.540> more<00:04:48.690> clique<00:04:48.930> intensive<00:04:49.440> so

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
it might be more clique intensive so

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.280 
it might be more clique intensive so
basically<00:04:50.430> you're<00:04:50.639> here<00:04:50.880> just<00:04:51.510> start<00:04:51.960> mining

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
basically you're here just start mining

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.840 
basically you're here just start mining
the<00:04:52.350> granite<00:04:52.680> rocks<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:53.220> mined<00:04:53.520> pretty

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
the granite rocks they mined pretty

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.820 
the granite rocks they mined pretty
quickly<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.450> as<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.800> just

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
quickly and as you can see it just

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.379 
quickly and as you can see it just
automatically<00:04:56.550> banks<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:56.970> for<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.360> you

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
automatically banks it for you so you

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.060 
automatically banks it for you so you
don't<00:04:57.540> have<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.690> worry<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.169> can<00:04:58.530> be<00:04:58.680> kind<00:04:58.979> of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
don't have to worry it can be kind of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.969 
don't have to worry it can be kind of
clique<00:04:59.639> intensive<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.270> grindy<00:05:00.780> but<00:05:01.320> trust<00:05:01.919> me

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
clique intensive and grindy but trust me

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.770 
clique intensive and grindy but trust me
it<00:05:02.250> does<00:05:02.430> make<00:05:02.639> pretty<00:05:02.910> good<00:05:03.000> money<00:05:03.120> for<00:05:03.720> a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
it does make pretty good money for a

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.900 
it does make pretty good money for a
mining<00:05:04.410> method<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:04.950> it's<00:05:05.370> pretty<00:05:05.700> decent

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
mining method and it's pretty decent

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.450 
mining method and it's pretty decent
mining<00:05:06.330> experience<00:05:06.720> as<00:05:06.840> well<00:05:07.050> I'll<00:05:07.320> do<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.130> 10

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
mining experience as well I'll do a 10

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.520 
mining experience as well I'll do a 10
minute<00:05:08.729> test<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.240> we'll<00:05:09.479> see<00:05:09.720> how<00:05:10.169> much<00:05:10.380> I

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
minute test and we'll see how much I

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.710 
minute test and we'll see how much I
actually<00:05:10.740> make<00:05:11.100> I'll<00:05:11.310> be<00:05:11.880> right<00:05:12.120> back<00:05:12.360> with

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
actually make I'll be right back with

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.300 
actually make I'll be right back with
the<00:05:12.960> 10<00:05:13.229> minute<00:05:13.500> test<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.919> then<00:05:14.010> we'll<00:05:14.100> find

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
the 10 minute test and then we'll find

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.340 
the 10 minute test and then we'll find
out<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.639> hourly<00:05:15.090> rate<00:05:15.270> from<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.660> because<00:05:16.110> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
out the hourly rate from that because it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.780 
out the hourly rate from that because it
kind<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.590> gives<00:05:16.710> us<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.010> good<00:05:17.160> estimate<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.760> how

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
kind of gives us a good estimate on how

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.430 
kind of gives us a good estimate on how
much<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.120> can<00:05:18.270> make<00:05:18.300> an<00:05:18.570> hour<00:05:18.690> if<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.080> did<00:05:19.260> pay

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
much you can make an hour if you did pay

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.650 
much you can make an hour if you did pay
attention<00:05:19.470> I'll<00:05:20.010> be<00:05:20.280> right<00:05:20.460> back<00:05:20.639> so<00:05:21.000> after<00:05:21.450> my

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
attention I'll be right back so after my

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.020 
attention I'll be right back so after my
10-minute<00:05:22.169> test<00:05:22.590> I<00:05:22.860> have<00:05:23.070> all<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.430> granite<00:05:23.880> in

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
10-minute test I have all the granite in

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.150 
10-minute test I have all the granite in
my<00:05:24.180> inventory<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:25.020> also<00:05:25.200> use<00:05:25.590> two<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:26.040> my

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
my inventory and I also use two of my

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.210 
my inventory and I also use two of my
urns<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.840> three<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:28.110> my<00:05:28.200> porters<00:05:28.800> so

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
urns and three of my porters so

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.210 
urns and three of my porters so
basically<00:05:29.729> I<00:05:30.030> use<00:05:30.330> 12<00:05:30.690> K<00:05:31.020> importers<00:05:31.680> like<00:05:31.890> GP

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
basically I use 12 K importers like GP

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.210 
basically I use 12 K importers like GP
wise<00:05:32.430> at<00:05:32.760> least<00:05:33.030> my<00:05:33.320> type<00:05:34.320> yours<00:05:34.919> might<00:05:35.190> be

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
wise at least my type yours might be

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.010 
wise at least my type yours might be
different<00:05:35.310> if<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:35.940> use<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> lower<00:05:36.360> tier<00:05:36.630> yours

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
different if you use a lower tier yours

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.659 
different if you use a lower tier yours
probably<00:05:37.229> would<00:05:37.560> be<00:05:37.680> higher<00:05:37.890> if<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.220> had<00:05:38.640> a

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
probably would be higher if you had a

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.340 
probably would be higher if you had a
lower<00:05:38.880> tier<00:05:39.120> but<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.660> means<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:39.930> spent<00:05:40.200> around

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
lower tier but that means I spent around

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.980 
lower tier but that means I spent around
100k<00:05:41.250> an<00:05:41.370> hour<00:05:41.490> just<00:05:41.850> on<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.120> porters<00:05:42.450> but

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
100k an hour just on the porters but

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.170 
100k an hour just on the porters but
that<00:05:43.110> isn't<00:05:43.470> that<00:05:43.650> bad<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:43.890> mean<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.700> do<00:05:44.910> make<00:05:45.150> a

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
that isn't that bad I mean you do make a

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.240 
that isn't that bad I mean you do make a
lot<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.570> money<00:05:45.720> from<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.990> granite<00:05:46.200> let's<00:05:47.100> go

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
lot of money from the granite let's go

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.100 
lot of money from the granite let's go
sell<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.669> granite<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.210> see<00:05:48.780> how<00:05:48.870> much<00:05:48.990> I

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
sell the granite and see how much I

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.870 
sell the granite and see how much I
actually<00:05:49.260> make<00:05:49.650> I<00:05:49.860> think<00:05:50.130> they<00:05:50.220> do<00:05:50.280> sell<00:05:50.669> for

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
actually make I think they do sell for

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.370 
actually make I think they do sell for
med<00:05:51.030> or<00:05:51.210> maybe<00:05:51.390> a<00:05:51.479> little<00:05:51.750> bit<00:05:51.840> less<00:05:51.990> than<00:05:52.169> med

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
med or maybe a little bit less than med

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.680 
med or maybe a little bit less than med
the<00:05:53.250> large<00:05:53.460> pieces<00:05:53.700> actually<00:05:54.180> sell<00:05:54.419> for<00:05:54.660> a

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
the large pieces actually sell for a

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.290 
the large pieces actually sell for a
little<00:05:54.990> bit<00:05:55.110> more<00:05:55.289> than<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.620> buy<00:05:56.100> 400<00:05:56.639> GP<00:05:57.120> so

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
little bit more than that buy 400 GP so

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300 
little bit more than that buy 400 GP so
it<00:05:57.389> isn't<00:05:57.600> really<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.780> much<00:05:58.080> more<00:05:58.770> but<00:05:59.130> that

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
it isn't really that much more but that

checked them earlier and I forgot to

empty my cash pouch or whatever but they
actually<00:06:13.650> did<00:06:14.070> add<00:06:14.250> up<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.639> 257<00:06:15.570> K<00:06:15.780> if<00:06:16.139> you

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
actually did add up to 257 K if you

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.540 
actually did add up to 257 K if you
really<00:06:16.530> wanted<00:06:16.800> to<00:06:16.860> you<00:06:16.950> could<00:06:17.190> add<00:06:17.340> them<00:06:17.460> all

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
really wanted to you could add them all

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.060 
really wanted to you could add them all
up<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:17.880> prove<00:06:18.630> me<00:06:18.840> right<00:06:19.050> but<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.830> was<00:06:19.919> like

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
up and prove me right but it was like

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.360 
up and prove me right but it was like
257<00:06:20.880> 258<00:06:21.539> K<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:22.020> if<00:06:22.229> you<00:06:22.320> times<00:06:22.530> that<00:06:22.650> by<00:06:22.740> 6<00:06:23.160> to

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
257 258 K and if you times that by 6 to

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.010 
257 258 K and if you times that by 6 to
make<00:06:23.460> it<00:06:23.610> into<00:06:23.850> an<00:06:23.970> hour<00:06:24.150> because<00:06:24.690> there<00:06:24.930> was

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
make it into an hour because there was

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.719 
make it into an hour because there was
only<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.229> 10-minute<00:06:25.680> test<00:06:25.889> that's<00:06:26.310> one<00:06:26.550> point

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
only a 10-minute test that's one point

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.060 
only a 10-minute test that's one point
five<00:06:27.090> five<00:06:27.510> mil<00:06:28.050> if<00:06:28.410> you<00:06:28.590> take<00:06:28.740> that<00:06:28.860> into

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
five five mil if you take that into

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.310 
five five mil if you take that into
consideration<00:06:29.100> this<00:06:29.880> method<00:06:30.240> is<00:06:30.389> pretty<00:06:31.020> much

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
consideration this method is pretty much

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.490 
consideration this method is pretty much
1.5<00:06:32.130> mil<00:06:32.400> an<00:06:32.520> hour<00:06:32.639> depending<00:06:33.300> on<00:06:33.720> you<00:06:34.470> know

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
1.5 mil an hour depending on you know

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.290 
1.5 mil an hour depending on you know
what<00:06:34.800> porters<00:06:35.159> you<00:06:35.310> use<00:06:35.520> and<00:06:35.729> stuff<00:06:35.909> but<00:06:36.240> I

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
what porters you use and stuff but I

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.940 
what porters you use and stuff but I
mean<00:06:36.510> I<00:06:36.539> didn't<00:06:36.900> go<00:06:37.020> like<00:06:37.229> super<00:06:37.680> hardcore

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
mean I didn't go like super hardcore

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.210 
mean I didn't go like super hardcore
like<00:06:38.310> you<00:06:38.430> can<00:06:38.610> so<00:06:38.849> this<00:06:39.000> is

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
like you can so this is

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.160 
like you can so this is
easily<00:06:39.520> 1.5<00:06:40.090> million<00:06:40.360> our<00:06:40.510> but<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:40.930> only

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170 
easily 1.5 million our but the only

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.810 
easily 1.5 million our but the only
problem<00:06:41.740> with<00:06:41.860> this<00:06:42.010> method<00:06:42.190> though<00:06:42.550> is<00:06:42.760> uh

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
problem with this method though is uh

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.000 
problem with this method though is uh
the<00:06:43.690> only<00:06:43.840> reason<00:06:44.230> it's<00:06:44.380> super<00:06:44.650> high<00:06:44.770> right

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
the only reason it's super high right

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.500 
the only reason it's super high right
now<00:06:45.040> is<00:06:45.310> because<00:06:45.610> of<00:06:45.640> double<00:06:45.970> xp<00:06:46.210> weekend

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
now is because of double xp weekend

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.210 
now is because of double xp weekend
coming<00:06:46.750> up<00:06:46.900> in<00:06:47.080> November<00:06:47.260> like<00:06:47.890> you<00:06:48.070> really

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
coming up in November like you really

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.520 
coming up in November like you really
can't<00:06:48.490> guarantee<00:06:49.060> this<00:06:49.300> method<00:06:49.690> will<00:06:50.080> work<00:06:50.110> in

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
can't guarantee this method will work in

I know 1.5 million hour isn't that great
anymore<00:06:55.840> but<00:06:56.110> for<00:06:56.290> something<00:06:56.440> like<00:06:56.560> mining

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
anymore but for something like mining

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.170 
anymore but for something like mining
it's<00:06:57.550> pretty<00:06:57.790> good

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540 
pretty nice 54 K in our mining honestly

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.330 
pretty nice 54 K in our mining honestly
you<00:07:10.720> can<00:07:10.840> say<00:07:11.020> it's<00:07:11.140> 55<00:07:11.590> k<00:07:11.860> just<00:07:12.130> for<00:07:12.280> the

you can say it's 55 k just for the

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.370 
you can say it's 55 k just for the
rounding<00:07:12.790> aspect<00:07:13.540> and<00:07:13.720> I<00:07:13.780> could<00:07:14.050> have<00:07:14.170> gone<00:07:14.230> a

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
rounding aspect and I could have gone a

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.590 
rounding aspect and I could have gone a
little<00:07:14.680> bit<00:07:14.890> more<00:07:15.070> hardcore<00:07:15.340> 1.5<00:07:16.270> mill<00:07:16.510> an

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600

for<00:07:19.300> just<00:07:19.690> you<00:07:19.870> know<00:07:19.960> a<00:07:19.990> little<00:07:20.200> mining<00:07:20.590> method

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
for just you know a little mining method

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.370 
for just you know a little mining method
it<00:07:21.040> is<00:07:21.160> more<00:07:21.460> money<00:07:21.640> per<00:07:21.940> hour<00:07:22.090> than<00:07:22.930> the

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
it is more money per hour than the

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.800 
it is more money per hour than the
