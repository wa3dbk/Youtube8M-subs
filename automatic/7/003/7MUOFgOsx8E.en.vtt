00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.590
 this is my favorite place on the farm she 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.660
 called summer kitchen in our country 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.210
 summer kitchens were very popular in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.480
 eighteenth nineteenth century 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.310
 especially in the south where summer is especially hot 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.680
 if you watched my garden show on 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.170
 the table you know that this kitchen is constantly 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.059
 used later i will talk about style 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.760
 this kitchen but first talk about 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.039
 functionality as you can see here too 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.860
 kitchen triangle cold water warm 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.600
 which greatly facilitates the work here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.059
 I have a lot of work surfaces here 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.039
 especially here behind my back here 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.320
 microwave heating honest closet a 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.480
 here is the central island on which there is 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.160
 gas stove and plenty of space to 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.090
 decompose everything needed for the dish 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.769
 ingredients or sit down friends this kitchen 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.490
 perfect for shooting 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:11.660
 television shows and for cooking for 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.770
 a lot of people or just 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.300
 to arrange a dinner party for friends 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.280
 I want to elaborate on the color 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.130
 palette because it creates a special 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.289
 mood room I used two 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.550
 grayscale because they create 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.490
 feeling of comfort 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.470
 notice it is cold gray but 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.289
 some brown elements will make it 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.780
 warmer as you can see the walls of the ceiling of the door 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.640
 the lockers are all painted gray what 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.920
 goes well with the rest 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 items of equipment space 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.720
 perceived as a single monolith 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.110
 notice the red elements 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.270
 red brick around the central fireplace 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.369
 the island is also painted poppy red 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.020
 what should attract attention and even 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.539
 remind the color of the firebird in the room 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.190
 there are other red elements warm 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.759
 the color of which creates an interesting 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.950
 the combination with the cold gray is first 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.280
 curtains on the windows with stripes of the same color 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.160
 in which the island is painted 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.190
 shades of heat and fire all this makes 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.790
 the room is very cozy note 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.130
 on the shelf 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.200
 they must be very strong because 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.540
 that the shelf serves as workhorses 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.959
 for kitchens like this massive 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.520
 triangular wooden props themselves 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.730
 wooden sticks with steel 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 edging 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.400
 it's not very expensive 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.840
 but it goes well with other 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.300
 steel elements 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.110
 exactly the result of which I wanted 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.670
 achieve 4 shelves on each side give 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.100
 huge amount of space to 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.780
 arrange plates containers jars and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.000
 the like besides with their help I 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.100
 I emphasize the red and orange tones 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.260
 it is on the shelves placed banks with 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.459
 pickles red and orange dishes 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.230
 vegetables and flowers from the garden and so on and also 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.840
 on them are placed items from my 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.780
 kitchenware collections some of 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.200
 they are old here is a combination of style 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.140
 and kitchen functionality conditionally 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.220
 divided into two parts this part of the kitchen and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.470
 South side 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.690
 intended to cook food a 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.170
 north side which is 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.030
 a fireplace to enjoy a meal here 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.329
 a large dining table around which 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 6 chairs are arranged 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.079
 the table is designed in a traditional rural 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.200
 style but he's brand new like 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.600
 chairs stand on wicker carpet 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.880
 the colors of which repeat the play of warm and 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.120
 cold colors of the whole room gray 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.250
 orange red 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.049
 the floor is also painted light gray 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.840
 to harmonize with the color 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.310
 gamut of all space is interesting 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.540
 rural focus create different 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.150
 items like this vintage braid 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:16.160
 candlesticks paintings depicting cows 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.050
 peaches and the like and horse 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.570
 but I can't help but mention the lighting and 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.700
 ceiling fans 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.470
 they are absolutely modern what creates 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.900
 interesting contrast with the furniture under 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.260
 antiqued and fit perfectly in common 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.260
 room style 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.680
