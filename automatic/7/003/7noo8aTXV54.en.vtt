00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.059 
long time I have and it really doesn't
affect<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:58.020> bandwidth<00:04:58.409> that<00:04:58.530> much<00:04:58.740> though

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
affect the bandwidth that much though

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.559 
affect the bandwidth that much though
it's<00:04:59.220> something<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.550> want<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.819> monitor<00:05:00.360> if

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
it's something you want to monitor if

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.420 
it's something you want to monitor if
you<00:05:01.110> have<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.289> very<00:05:01.440> restrictive<00:05:01.979> bandwidth

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
you have a very restrictive bandwidth

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.010 
you have a very restrictive bandwidth
package<00:05:02.909> so<00:05:03.419> there's<00:05:03.569> a<00:05:03.599> quick<00:05:03.780> look<00:05:03.930> at

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
package so there's a quick look at

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.719

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
using an iOS device just give it a go

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.740 
using an iOS device just give it a go
create<00:05:10.949> a<00:05:10.979> few<00:05:11.430> stations<00:05:11.669> though<00:05:12.060> not<00:05:12.449> just

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
create a few stations though not just

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.450 
create a few stations though not just
one<00:05:12.990> because<00:05:13.319> no<00:05:13.470> one<00:05:13.710> station<00:05:14.159> is<00:05:14.250> going<00:05:14.370> to
