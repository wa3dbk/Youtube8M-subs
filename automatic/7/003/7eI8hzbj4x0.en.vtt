what about the interior of the car I see

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
what about the interior of the car I see
some<00:02:11.849> racing<00:02:12.180> seats<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> cage

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
some racing seats I see a cage

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.840 
some racing seats I see a cage
the<00:02:13.500> interior<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.190> car<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.640> completely

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the interior of the car is completely

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.170 
the interior of the car is completely
redone<00:02:15.510> as<00:02:15.660> well<00:02:16.340> new<00:02:17.340> door<00:02:17.550> panels<00:02:17.940> were

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.560 
redone as well new door panels were
rewrapped<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.170> find<00:02:19.950> our<00:02:20.070> grain<00:02:20.310> vinyl<00:02:20.940> just

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
rewrapped and find our grain vinyl just

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.000 
rewrapped and find our grain vinyl just
so<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.900> matches<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.320> seats<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.710> little<00:02:22.740> bit

some CCW wheels which I'm familiar with

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.310 
some CCW wheels which I'm familiar with
as<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> Corvette<00:02:44.820> guy<00:02:45.030> CCW<00:02:45.810> makes<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.080> lot<00:02:46.200> of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
as a Corvette guy CCW makes a lot of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.120 
as a Corvette guy CCW makes a lot of
Vettes<00:02:46.500> stuff<00:02:46.740> with<00:02:48.050> 345<00:02:49.050> tires<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:49.920> yeah

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
Vettes stuff with 345 tires on this yeah

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.450 
Vettes stuff with 345 tires on this yeah
now<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> Viper<00:02:51.150> comes<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.720> 335<00:02:52.590> tires<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that I think is the biggest tire on a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040 
that I think is the biggest tire on a
production<00:02:56.040> car<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.490> now<00:02:56.700> that's<00:02:57.630> nice

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
it has build pictures of the car so if I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.870 
it has build pictures of the car so if I
go<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.230> car<00:03:07.590> show<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.160> incorporate<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
go to a car show I can incorporate the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.730 
go to a car show I can incorporate the
display<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.390> car<00:03:09.600> into<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.170> car<00:03:10.440> that's

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
display of the car into the car that's

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.200 
display of the car into the car that's
cool<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.640> when<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.060> much

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
cool but when you have this much

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.550 
cool but when you have this much
horsepower<00:03:12.750> isn't<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.200> kind<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.380> actually

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
horsepower isn't it kind of actually

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.170 
horsepower isn't it kind of actually
nice<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:13.920> little<00:03:14.430> extra<00:03:14.610> weight<00:03:14.850> over<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
nice that little extra weight over the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.210 
nice that little extra weight over the
tires<00:03:15.450> yeah<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.020> 345<00:03:16.620> s<00:03:16.800> what<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> lot<00:03:17.130> of

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
tires yeah with the 345 s what a lot of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.830 
tires yeah with the 345 s what a lot of
people<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.760> wider<00:03:17.970> tires<00:03:18.270> equals<00:03:18.660> more

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
people think is wider tires equals more

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.690 
people think is wider tires equals more
traction<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.440> you're<00:03:19.680> also<00:03:20.010> dispersing<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
traction but you're also dispersing the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.630 
traction but you're also dispersing the
weight<00:03:21.200> differently<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:23.130> lot<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.400> people

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
weight differently so a lot of people

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.190 
weight differently so a lot of people
overlook<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.180> fact<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.050> weight

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
overlook that fact and the weight

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.660 
overlook that fact and the weight
actually<00:03:25.470> helps<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.070> driver<00:03:26.310> yeah<00:03:26.580> I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
actually helps on the driver yeah I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.330 
actually helps on the driver yeah I
believe<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.890> should<00:03:29.040> take<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.220> for<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
believe that you should take it for a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.800 
believe that you should take it for a
ride<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.610> see<00:03:29.670> how<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.910> goes<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.360> should

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
ride and see how it goes I should

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.590 
ride and see how it goes I should
