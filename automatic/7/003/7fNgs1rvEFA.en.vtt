out<00:04:03.959> just<00:04:04.260> right<00:04:04.620> click<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.220> open<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:06.200> and

out just right click on it open it and
as<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.100> can<00:04:08.250> see<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.700> what<00:04:08.850> sync<00:04:09.120> looks

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
as you can see this is what sync looks

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.870 
as you can see this is what sync looks
like<00:04:09.630> when<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.989> get<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.320> fully<00:04:10.620> installed<00:04:11.190> you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
like when you get it fully installed you

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.699 
like when you get it fully installed you
don't<00:04:12.060> even<00:04:12.209> really<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.750> use<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.290> I'm<00:04:13.470> not

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
don't even really have to use it I'm not

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.050 
don't even really have to use it I'm not
gonna<00:04:13.829> uninstall<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.700> because<00:04:16.910> there's<00:04:17.910> no

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
gonna uninstall it because there's no

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.449

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
reason for me to uninstalling you can go

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.800 
reason for me to uninstalling you can go
ahead<00:04:20.579> try<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.299> don't<00:04:21.450> know<00:04:21.539> if<00:04:21.630> that'll

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
ahead try it I don't know if that'll

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.900 
ahead try it I don't know if that'll
take<00:04:22.020> away<00:04:22.289> two<00:04:22.349> on<00:04:22.590> USB<00:04:23.099> Driver<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:23.760> I

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
take away two on USB Driver but I

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.370 
take away two on USB Driver but I
wouldn't<00:04:24.210> risk<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.110> sits<00:04:25.260> there

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
wouldn't risk it it just sits there

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.260 
wouldn't risk it it just sits there

my USB device plugged in right now it's

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.969 
my USB device plugged in right now it's
inside<00:04:33.150> since<00:04:33.449> my<00:04:33.599> phone<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.050> rooted<00:04:34.259> and<00:04:34.800> I

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
inside since my phone is rooted and I

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.950 
inside since my phone is rooted and I
have<00:04:35.160> signage<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:35.819> mod<00:04:36.000> running<00:04:36.449> on<00:04:36.569> mine

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
have signage and mod running on mine

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.080 
have signage and mod running on mine
that's<00:04:37.169> probably<00:04:37.409> why<00:04:37.770> our<00:04:37.800> sink<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.370> not

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
that's probably why our sink is not

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.149 
that's probably why our sink is not
recognized<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:40.020> my<00:04:40.169> phone<00:04:40.440> because<00:04:40.710> it

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
recognized on my phone because it

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.129 
recognized on my phone because it
probably<00:04:41.370> needs<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.849> connect<00:04:42.270> with<00:04:42.509> sense<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
probably needs to connect with sense and

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.350 
probably needs to connect with sense and
sense<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.039> sync<00:04:44.310> connects<00:04:44.729> with<00:04:44.970> each<00:04:45.120> other

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
sense and sync connects with each other

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.050 
sense and sync connects with each other
but<00:04:46.080> since<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.650> have<00:04:46.830> CyanogenMod<00:04:47.669> seven

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060

not<00:04:52.830> gonna<00:04:53.009> work<00:04:53.280> for<00:04:53.310> me<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:53.879> didn't<00:04:54.120> want

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
not gonna work for me but I didn't want

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.330 
not gonna work for me but I didn't want
to<00:04:54.360> use<00:04:54.509> sink<00:04:54.810> anyway<00:04:55.259> you<00:04:55.620> might<00:04:55.860> want<00:04:56.099> to<00:04:56.159> use

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
to use sink anyway you might want to use

to use sink anyway you might want to use
it<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.699> don't<00:04:56.879> know<00:04:57.030> why<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:58.460> once<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.550> plug<00:04:59.759> in

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
it I don't know why but once you plug in

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.379 
it I don't know why but once you plug in
your<00:05:00.150> USB<00:05:00.210> device<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:02.550> go<00:05:02.729> back<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.150> run

once<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.590> if<00:05:14.009> you<00:05:14.099> have<00:05:14.280> an<00:05:14.370> HTC<00:05:15.000> device<00:05:15.539> your

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
once you if you have an HTC device your

once you if you have an HTC device your
serial<00:05:16.650> number<00:05:16.919> will<00:05:17.039> probably<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.490> some

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
serial number will probably be some

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.450 
serial number will probably be some
number<00:05:18.210> HTC<00:05:18.990> I<00:05:19.199> remember<00:05:19.530> my<00:05:19.650> old<00:05:19.889> number<00:05:20.130> used

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
number HTC I remember my old number used

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.100 
number HTC I remember my old number used
to<00:05:20.610> be<00:05:20.759> all<00:05:21.120> serial<00:05:21.539> number<00:05:21.750> used<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.990> be

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
to be all serial number used to be

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.939 
to be all serial number used to be
something<00:05:22.469> something

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
something something

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.180 
something something
HTC<00:05:23.880> but<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.419> think<00:05:24.870> since<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.139> have<00:05:25.349> CyanogenMod

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
HTC but I think since I have CyanogenMod

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.240 
HTC but I think since I have CyanogenMod
on<00:05:26.400> here<00:05:26.550> that's<00:05:26.759> why<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:26.969> serial<00:05:27.449> number<00:05:27.719> is

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
on here that's why the serial number is

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.180 
on here that's why the serial number is
just<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> generic<00:05:29.759> numbers<00:05:30.629> and<00:05:30.900> then<00:05:31.190> ABCDEF

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
just the generic numbers and then ABCDEF

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.209 
just the generic numbers and then ABCDEF
once<00:05:33.090> again<00:05:33.449> it<00:05:33.750> works<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.710> can<00:05:34.740> develop

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
once again it works and I can develop

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.629 
once again it works and I can develop
