there's no reprint of this actual card
so<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.650> probably<00:04:09.860> why<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.130> price<00:04:10.489> will

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
so this is probably why the price will

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.490 
so this is probably why the price will
just<00:04:10.940> stay<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.269> same<00:04:11.420> until<00:04:11.870> they<00:04:12.110> gets<00:04:12.350> the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
just stay the same until they gets the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.140 
just stay the same until they gets the
reprint<00:04:12.950> or<00:04:13.130> until<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.700> band<00:04:13.880> this<00:04:14.000> is

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
don't know if it will go up tell what it

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760 
don't know if it will go up tell what it
is<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.940> higher<00:05:06.150> than<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.450> is<00:05:06.510> now<00:05:06.690> but<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.530> price

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
is to higher than it is now but a price

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.200 
is to higher than it is now but a price
is<00:05:07.980> pretty<00:05:08.130> high<00:05:08.370> right<00:05:08.520> now<00:05:08.580> such<00:05:08.880> injustice

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
is pretty high right now such injustice

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.290 
is pretty high right now such injustice

already did this last month but the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.340 
already did this last month but the
price<00:05:26.520> has<00:05:26.550> gone<00:05:26.790> up<00:05:26.940> again<00:05:27.330> five<00:05:27.810> pounds<00:05:28.020> and
