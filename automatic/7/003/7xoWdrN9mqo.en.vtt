hyper<00:00:12.349> Dragonoid<00:00:12.919> so<00:00:13.959> you<00:00:14.959> can<00:00:15.110> see<00:00:15.259> the

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
hyper Dragonoid so you can see the

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.840 
hyper Dragonoid so you can see the
purple<00:00:15.679> one<00:00:15.799> right<00:00:15.980> here<00:00:16.190> I<00:00:16.219> believe<00:00:16.520> this<00:00:16.700> one

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
purple one right here I believe this one

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.430 
purple one right here I believe this one
comes<00:00:17.060> out<00:00:17.210> of<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.390> flip<00:00:17.570> version<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.140> this

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
comes out of the flip version and this

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.440 
comes out of the flip version and this
is<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.890> pires<00:00:19.340> version<00:00:19.730> that's<00:00:19.910> all<00:00:20.030> closed

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
is the pires version that's all closed

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.070 
is the pires version that's all closed
up<00:00:20.680> so<00:00:21.680> he<00:00:22.100> kind<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.460> looks<00:00:22.970> like<00:00:23.150> neo

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
up so he kind of looks like neo

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
on it seems to be specifically the

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.639 
on it seems to be specifically the
darkest<00:01:10.399> ones<00:01:10.579> they<00:01:11.509> come<00:01:11.840> out<00:01:11.990> with<00:01:12.020> one<00:01:12.439> that

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
darkest ones they come out with one that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.190 
darkest ones they come out with one that
is<00:01:12.799> fully<00:01:13.189> brush<00:01:13.549> or<00:01:13.880> one<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.389> is<00:01:14.450> non<00:01:14.899> lots

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.139 
one that has a purple harm the same
thing<00:01:17.119> went<00:01:17.329> with<00:01:17.509> Hades<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.939> I<00:01:19.939> believe

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
thing went with Hades and I believe

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.429 
thing went with Hades and I believe
there<00:01:20.270> was<00:01:20.359> another<00:01:20.569> one<00:01:20.749> because<00:01:21.109> they're

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
there was another one because they're

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.510 
there was another one because they're
exactly<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.829> same<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.159> even<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.369> same

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
exactly the same that even the same

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.809 
exactly the same that even the same
g-power<00:01:22.850> they're<00:01:23.060> both<00:01:23.149> 530<00:01:23.899> geez<00:01:24.139> but<00:01:24.859> I<00:01:25.189> got

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
g-power they're both 530 geez but I got

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.969 
g-power they're both 530 geez but I got
them<00:01:25.939> both<00:01:26.090> because<00:01:26.359> I<00:01:26.899> don't<00:01:27.409> know<00:01:27.530> just<00:01:27.889> to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
them both because I don't know just to

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.129 
them both because I don't know just to
prove<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.310> point<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.639> there<00:01:29.539> are<00:01:29.689> differences

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139
