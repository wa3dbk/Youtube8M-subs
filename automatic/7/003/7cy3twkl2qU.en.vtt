air new zealand dollars which on a hole
that's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> expensive

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that's not actually the expensive

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
that's not actually the expensive
considering<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:21.750> much<00:01:21.930> normal<00:01:22.170> mascara<00:01:22.530> czar

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
considering how much normal mascara czar

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.609 
considering how much normal mascara czar
but<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> mascara<00:01:25.439> in
