there are so many things to talk about
with<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.680> movie<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.159> hard<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.670> where

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
with this movie it's hard to know where

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
with this movie it's hard to know where
to<00:01:41.909> even<00:01:41.939> start<00:01:42.259> probably<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.560> thing<00:01:43.740> I'm

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
to even start probably the thing I'm

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
to even start probably the thing I'm
impressed<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.399> most<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.939> their<00:01:45.149> ability<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
impressed with most is their ability to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
impressed with most is their ability to
break<00:01:45.930> certain<00:01:46.200> cliches<00:01:46.799> while<00:01:47.100> still

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
break certain cliches while still

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
break certain cliches while still
holding<00:01:47.430> true<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.850> others<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.630> Disney

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
holding true to others that make Disney

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
holding true to others that make Disney
so<00:01:49.140> popular<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> way

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
so popular but they do it in a way

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
so popular but they do it in a way
that's<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.630> obvious<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.320> feels<00:01:52.710> very

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that's not so obvious it feels very

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.620 
that's not so obvious it feels very
natural<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> way<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.119> set<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.479> these

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
natural in the way they set up these

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.719 
natural in the way they set up these
characters<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.470> thought<00:01:55.950> back<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> films<00:01:56.549> like

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
characters I thought back to films like

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
characters I thought back to films like
Enchanted<00:01:57.420> where<00:01:57.570> they<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.869> hammered<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Enchanted where they just hammered the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.499 
Enchanted where they just hammered the
lesson<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.610> they're<00:01:59.759> going<00:02:00.060> against

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
lesson in that they're going against

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
lesson in that they're going against
these<00:02:00.659> Disney<00:02:01.020> cliches<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.579> just

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
these Disney cliches and here it just

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580 
these Disney cliches and here it just
felt<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.689> part<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.140> story<00:02:04.409> they

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
felt like it was part of a story they

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
felt like it was part of a story they
would<00:02:04.740> tell<00:02:04.950> even<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.520> wasn't<00:02:05.850> Disney

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
would tell even if it wasn't Disney

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.150 
would tell even if it wasn't Disney
related<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.469> ties<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.920> what's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
related because it ties into what's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.889 
related because it ties into what's
going<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.520> nowadays<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.300> continue<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
going on nowadays and will continue to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.440 
going on nowadays and will continue to
happen<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
happen in the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.270 
happen in the
future<00:02:10.780> for<00:02:11.260> example<00:02:11.319> there<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:11.920> still<00:02:12.250> a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
future for example there is still a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.830 
future for example there is still a
romance<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.849> blooms<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.360> only<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.599> few<00:02:13.780> days

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
romance that blooms in only a few days

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.720 
romance that blooms in only a few days
but<00:02:14.500> they<00:02:14.560> also<00:02:14.709> Mock<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.069> fact<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.519> she's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
but they also Mock the fact that she's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.400 
but they also Mock the fact that she's
going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.060> marry<00:02:16.390> somebody<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.870> she<00:02:17.140> just

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
going to marry somebody that she just

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.229 
going to marry somebody that she just
met<00:02:17.650> which<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.099> course<00:02:18.129> is<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> big<00:02:18.670> criticism

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
met which of course is a big criticism

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.180 
met which of course is a big criticism
the<00:02:19.330> female<00:02:19.660> leads<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.170> past<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:21.010> this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
the female leads in the past but this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.160 
the female leads in the past but this
also<00:02:21.430> makes<00:02:21.819> sense<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.360> character<00:02:22.840> she

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
also makes sense for the character she

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.199 
also makes sense for the character she
has<00:02:23.410> been<00:02:23.650> shut<00:02:23.920> away<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.610> long<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:25.180> she

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
has been shut away for so long that she

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.360 
has been shut away for so long that she
would<00:02:25.599> just<00:02:25.810> give<00:02:25.959> herself<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.379> anybody<00:02:26.890> it's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
would just give herself to anybody it's

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.830 
would just give herself to anybody it's
a<00:02:27.489> new<00:02:27.640> experience<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.450> she<00:02:28.599> would<00:02:28.750> be

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
a new experience and she would be

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.540 
a new experience and she would be
excited<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.800> movie<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.130> showing<00:02:30.370> the
