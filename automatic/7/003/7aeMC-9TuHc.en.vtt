00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.440 

so<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.730> right<00:05:11.880> now

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
so this is it right now

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.750 
so this is it right now
waiting<00:05:12.750> for<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.110> cool<00:05:13.380> we've<00:05:14.220> got<00:05:14.520> about

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
waiting for to cool we've got about

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.270 
waiting for to cool we've got about
seven<00:05:15.330> dishes<00:05:15.810> here<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.380> after<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:16.980> cools

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
seven dishes here and after it cools

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.430 
seven dishes here and after it cools
down<00:05:17.630> we<00:05:18.630> are<00:05:18.720> going<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:18.990> mix<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.290> together

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
down we are going to mix it together

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.380 
down we are going to mix it together
with<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.950> yeast<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.460> that's<00:05:20.730> it

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.920 

cool<00:05:27.260> already<00:05:28.330> come<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.480> start<00:05:29.810> off<00:05:29.990> with<00:05:31.930> one

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
cool already come I start off with one

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:52.680 
cool already come I start off with one
of<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.140> dishes<00:05:33.350> put<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:33.950> in<00:05:34.010> like<00:05:34.160> this

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.990 

just<00:05:53.260> put<00:05:53.470> it<00:05:53.590> like<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.100> then<00:05:54.460> we'll<00:05:54.670> put

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
just put it like this and then we'll put

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.590 
just put it like this and then we'll put
in<00:05:55.210> some<00:05:55.630> of<00:05:56.290> this<00:05:57.190> make<00:05:57.760> sure<00:05:57.970> your<00:05:58.270> hands<00:05:58.570> are

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
in some of this make sure your hands are

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.760 
in some of this make sure your hands are
dry<00:05:59.200> and<00:05:59.560> clean<00:06:00.840> we'll<00:06:01.840> put<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.170> in<00:06:02.290> some<00:06:02.620> like

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
dry and clean we'll put it in some like

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:19.390 
dry and clean we'll put it in some like
this<00:06:02.950> first

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.600 

put<00:06:19.910> a<00:06:19.940> wet<00:06:20.150> layer<00:06:20.360> just<00:06:21.190> but<00:06:22.190> thin<00:06:22.400> white

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
put a wet layer just but thin white

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.650 
put a wet layer just but thin white
layer<00:06:22.850> like<00:06:23.090> this<00:06:24.670> and<00:06:25.670> then<00:06:28.060> so<00:06:29.060> now<00:06:29.270> what<00:06:29.540> I'm

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
layer like this and then so now what I'm

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.280 
layer like this and then so now what I'm
going<00:06:29.930> to<00:06:29.990> do<00:06:30.200> is<00:06:30.470> just<00:06:31.300> stir<00:06:32.300> it<00:06:35.080> so<00:06:36.080> that's

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
going to do is just stir it so that's

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.320 
going to do is just stir it so that's
evenly<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:37.460> don't<00:06:37.640> want<00:06:37.790> to<00:06:37.880> make<00:06:38.030> it<00:06:38.150> too

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
evenly you don't want to make it too

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.350 
evenly you don't want to make it too
mushy<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.870> just<00:06:39.140> stir<00:06:39.350> it<00:06:39.380> lightly<00:06:39.680> at<00:06:39.920> this

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
mushy you just stir it lightly at this

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.800 
mushy you just stir it lightly at this
so<00:06:41.360> that<00:06:41.510> all<00:06:41.630> our<00:06:41.780> yeast<00:06:42.070> gets<00:06:43.810> evenly

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
so that all our yeast gets evenly

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.410 
so that all our yeast gets evenly
distributed<00:06:46.630> among<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.660> rind<00:06:47.990> more<00:06:48.260> time

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
distributed among the rind more time

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.670 
distributed among the rind more time
this<00:06:50.420> should<00:06:50.630> be<00:06:50.720> done<00:06:50.870> in<00:06:51.020> about<00:06:51.110> three<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:51.620> a

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
this should be done in about three and a

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.720 
this should be done in about three and a
half<00:06:51.830> days<00:06:53.410> depending<00:06:54.410> on<00:06:54.530> how<00:06:55.130> warm<00:06:55.550> the

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
half days depending on how warm the

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:02.269 
half days depending on how warm the
weather<00:06:55.940> is

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.269 

yeah<00:07:02.849> I<00:07:03.239> think<00:07:03.689> that's<00:07:03.839> okay<00:07:04.769> what<00:07:05.249> I

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:05.279 
yeah I think that's okay what I

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.339 
yeah I think that's okay what I
generally<00:07:05.879> tend<00:07:06.149> to<00:07:06.299> do<00:07:06.449> is<00:07:06.629> I<00:07:06.749> like<00:07:06.929> to<00:07:06.989> put<00:07:07.139> a

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:07.349 
generally tend to do is I like to put a

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.879 
generally tend to do is I like to put a
little<00:07:07.499> hole<00:07:07.859> in<00:07:08.009> the<00:07:08.099> middle<00:07:08.399> like<00:07:08.519> this<00:07:09.889> so

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
little hole in the middle like this so

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:16.309 
little hole in the middle like this so
that<00:07:10.919> the<00:07:11.959> alcohol<00:07:12.959> can<00:07:13.139> flow<00:07:13.409> through<00:07:15.319> I'm

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 
that the alcohol can flow through I'm

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:24.679 
that the alcohol can flow through I'm
gonna<00:07:16.469> put<00:07:16.649> a<00:07:16.679> little<00:07:16.829> bow<00:07:17.099> on<00:07:17.129> there<00:07:23.509> no<00:07:24.509> bow

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:24.689 
gonna put a little bow on there no bow

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.899 
gonna put a little bow on there no bow
like<00:07:24.929> this<00:07:24.959> I<00:07:25.699> basically<00:07:28.429> put<00:07:29.429> it<00:07:29.489> in<00:07:29.699> upside

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:29.909 
like this I basically put it in upside

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.309 
like this I basically put it in upside
down<00:07:30.359> like<00:07:30.509> this<00:07:31.099> just<00:07:32.099> coop<00:07:32.369> to<00:07:32.609> create<00:07:32.969> a

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 
down like this just coop to create a

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:40.669 
down like this just coop to create a
hole<00:07:35.989> for<00:07:38.119> liquid<00:07:39.119> to<00:07:39.929> go<00:07:40.110> down<00:07:40.289> and<00:07:40.589> that's

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:40.679 
hole for liquid to go down and that's

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:47.170 
hole for liquid to go down and that's
all<00:07:42.169> they<00:07:43.169> are

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.719 

here<00:07:47.810> is<00:07:48.110> a<00:07:48.139> close-up<00:07:48.770> picture<00:07:49.009> of<00:07:49.460> what<00:07:49.610> it

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:49.729 
here is a close-up picture of what it

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:52.980 
here is a close-up picture of what it
looks<00:07:49.940> like<00:07:50.120> before<00:07:51.080> I<00:07:51.139> cover<00:07:51.560> it<00:07:51.770> up<00:07:51.860> with<00:07:52.070> a

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:52.990 
looks like before I cover it up with a

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:59.260 
looks like before I cover it up with a
blanket<00:07:53.990> and<00:07:55.930> this<00:07:56.930> is<00:07:57.110> it<00:07:57.259> right<00:07:57.440> here<00:07:58.270> I'm

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.270 
blanket and this is it right here I'm

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.020 
blanket and this is it right here I'm
covering<00:07:59.810> it<00:08:01.030> with<00:08:02.030> an<00:08:02.360> electric<00:08:02.690> blanket<00:08:03.050> and

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.030 
covering it with an electric blanket and

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.210 
covering it with an electric blanket and
setting<00:08:05.030> it<00:08:05.120> in<00:08:05.240> so<00:08:05.389> that<00:08:05.419> it's<00:08:05.660> warm<00:08:06.190> for<00:08:07.190> a

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.220 
setting it in so that it's warm for a

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.699 
setting it in so that it's warm for a
couple<00:08:07.580> days
