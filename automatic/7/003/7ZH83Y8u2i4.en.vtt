00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
need to do you get it working up

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.080 
need to do you get it working up
currently<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.360> um<00:01:10.670> 4700<00:01:11.670> point<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:11.939> life

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
currently I have um 4700 point one life

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.840 
currently I have um 4700 point one life
which<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.330> obviously<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.229> low<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
which is obviously very low you want to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
which is obviously very low you want to
get<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.390> low<00:01:15.600> life<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.990> possible<00:01:16.409> currently

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
get as low life as possible currently

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
get as low life as possible currently
have<00:01:17.369> nothing<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.909> increased<00:01:18.420> vitality<00:01:18.630> or

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
have nothing that increased vitality or

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
have nothing that increased vitality or
life<00:01:19.740> percentage<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.390> reason<00:01:21.540> why<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
life percentage and so the reason why is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
life percentage and so the reason why is
because<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> light<00:01:23.130> as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
because you want as the light as

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
because you want as the light as
possible<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.869> only<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
possible because you can only take a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
possible because you can only take a
swim<00:01:25.799> amount<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> percentages<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.970> believe

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
swim amount of percentages I believe

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
swim amount of percentages I believe
it's<00:01:27.540> 28<00:01:27.960> eight<00:01:28.110> percent<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.770> correct<00:01:28.979> me<00:01:29.100> if

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's 28 eight percent but correct me if

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's 28 eight percent but correct me if
I'm<00:01:29.369> wrong<00:01:29.509> when<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.780> us<00:01:31.110> energy<00:01:31.770> armor

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I'm wrong when you use us energy armor

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.380 
I'm wrong when you use us energy armor
when<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> reinforced<00:01:33.210> armor

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
when you have the reinforced armor

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
when you have the reinforced armor
that's<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.350> allows<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> only<00:01:35.070> take

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that's what allows you to only take

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
that's what allows you to only take
percentage<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.790> damage<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.689> basically<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
percentage of damage so basically as you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.090 
percentage of damage so basically as you

what<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.369> boat<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.610> get

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
what you want to do this boat is get

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
what you want to do this boat is get
your<00:01:54.000> regeneration<00:01:54.479> obviously<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.229> high<00:01:55.380> as

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
your regeneration obviously as high as

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.889 
your regeneration obviously as high as
possible<00:01:56.060> currently<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.210> i<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.780> may

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
possible currently if i can get it may

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
possible currently if i can get it may
be<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.079> triple<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.040> i<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.399> now<00:01:59.610> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
be a triple of what i have right now it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.810 
be a triple of what i have right now it
might<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:01.079> great<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.979> actually<00:02:02.130> use

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
might actually be great to actually use

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.649 
might actually be great to actually use
current

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.539

I think<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.259> build<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.130> does<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
I think this is build it does have a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.919 
I think this is build it does have a
little<00:02:05.640> bit<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.850> claws<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:06.840> attacked

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
little bit of claws if you get attacked

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.279 
little bit of claws if you get attacked
too<00:02:07.740> fast<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.849> die<00:02:09.060> obviously<00:02:09.989> you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
too fast you will die obviously you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.880 
too fast you will die obviously you
basically<00:02:10.739> take<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.129> horn<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.330> will<00:02:12.510> die

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
basically take on horn is you will die

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.050 
basically take on horn is you will die
but<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.129> do<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.580> lot<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.790> things

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but you know you do have a lot of things

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.490 
but you know you do have a lot of things
to<00:02:15.180> support<00:02:15.480> yourself<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.870> diamonds<00:02:16.230> skin

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
to support yourself like diamonds skin

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
to support yourself like diamonds skin
and<00:02:16.709> frost<00:02:17.549> come<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.879> keep<00:02:17.970> yourself<00:02:18.090> alive

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
and frost come and keep yourself alive

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.539 
and frost come and keep yourself alive
if<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.019> see<00:02:19.650> yourself<00:02:19.950> basically<00:02:20.099> get<00:02:20.400> hit

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
if you see yourself basically get hit

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.800 
if you see yourself basically get hit
once<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.910> want<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> activate<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.599> those

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
once you want to activate one of those

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.589 
once you want to activate one of those
or<00:02:22.319> use<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.769> little<00:02:23.610> force<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.000> impactful<00:02:24.450> way

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
or use a little force with impactful way

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.720 
or use a little force with impactful way
but<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.900> does<00:02:25.019> help<00:02:25.200> out<00:02:25.379> quite<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> bit<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.489> as

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
but it does help out quite a bit so as

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.729 
but it does help out quite a bit so as
you<00:02:26.879> can<00:02:26.970> see<00:02:27.209> basically<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.349> can<00:02:28.470> survive

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
you can see basically you can survive

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.740 
you can see basically you can survive
normally<00:02:29.430> emotions<00:02:29.879> at<00:02:29.940> all<00:02:30.000> pushing<00:02:30.269> learn<00:02:30.510> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
normally emotions at all pushing learn I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 
normally emotions at all pushing learn I
actually<00:02:31.110> kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.470> useless<00:02:31.799> when<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.610> use

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
actually kind of useless when you use

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.300 
actually kind of useless when you use
this<00:02:32.849> bill<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.410> basically<00:02:34.410> once<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.129> could

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this bill because basically once I could

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.979 
this bill because basically once I could
go<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.549> get<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> same<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.060> fact<00:02:36.239> as<00:02:36.420> appealing

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
go and get the same in fact as appealing

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.920 
go and get the same in fact as appealing
um<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.769> mean<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.940> guess<00:02:39.090> if<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.390> take<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.810> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
um I mean I guess if you take to it you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.050 
um I mean I guess if you take to it you
can<00:02:40.079> try<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.709> cast<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.400> at<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.819> end<00:02:41.849> of<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
can try to cast it but at the end of the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.430 
can try to cast it but at the end of the
day<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> think<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.629> catching<00:02:43.110> one<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.290> your

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
day I think I catching one of your

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.650 
day I think I catching one of your
defensive<00:02:44.190> skills<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.670> going<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.420> better

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
defensive skills is going to be better

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.509 
defensive skills is going to be better
so<00:02:46.079> yeah<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> just<00:02:46.829> wanted<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.129> show<00:02:47.280> off<00:02:47.400> this

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
so yeah I just wanted to show off this

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.670 
so yeah I just wanted to show off this
build<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.269> guys<00:02:48.360> didn't<00:02:48.660> see<00:02:48.810> how<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
build and you guys didn't see how it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.430 
build and you guys didn't see how it
does<00:02:50.250> actually<00:02:50.519> work<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.900> know<00:02:51.959> infrared

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
does actually work and you know infrared

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.380 
does actually work and you know infrared
difficulty<00:02:52.890> as<00:02:53.160> wizard<00:02:53.760> using<00:02:54.000> don't<00:02:54.299> have

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
difficulty as wizard using don't have

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.869 
difficulty as wizard using don't have
too<00:02:54.510> much<00:02:54.629> life<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.109> so<00:02:55.620> perhaps<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.730> can

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
too much life and so perhaps you can

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.539 
too much life and so perhaps you can
