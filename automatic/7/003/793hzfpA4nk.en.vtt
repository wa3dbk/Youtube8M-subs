00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.850 
I'll grab this fool so in this bowl is
uh<00:04:36.600> there's<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.720> whole<00:04:37.870> mixture<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.470> stuff<00:04:38.680> in

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
uh there's a whole mixture of stuff in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.020 
uh there's a whole mixture of stuff in
here<00:04:38.980> this<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.250> just<00:04:39.400> sort<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.640> where<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:39.880> keep

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
here this is just sort of where we keep

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.620 
here this is just sort of where we keep
all<00:04:40.180> frozen<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.080> big<00:04:41.230> piece<00:04:41.380> of<00:04:41.410> pork

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
all frozen this is a big piece of pork

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.670 
all frozen this is a big piece of pork
probably<00:04:43.630> don't<00:04:43.690> won't<00:04:44.050> feed<00:04:44.230> them<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.470> this

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
probably don't won't feed them this this

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.580 
probably don't won't feed them this this
is<00:04:44.770> probably<00:04:44.950> for<00:04:45.130> us<00:04:45.250> but<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:46.510> pork<00:04:46.810> gives<00:04:47.500> a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
is probably for us but the pork gives a

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.730 
is probably for us but the pork gives a
bad<00:04:47.770> gas<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.280> we<00:04:48.370> don't<00:04:48.460> feel<00:04:48.669> important<00:04:49.740> what

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
bad gas so we don't feel important what

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.770 
bad gas so we don't feel important what
is<00:04:50.860> this<00:04:51.040> is<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.610> marrow<00:04:51.970> bone<00:04:52.150> just<00:04:52.630> our

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
is this is a marrow bone just our

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.270 
is this is a marrow bone just our
recreational<00:04:53.350> Bowl<00:04:53.530> we<00:04:53.950> don't<00:04:54.100> give<00:04:54.190> them

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
recreational Bowl we don't give them

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.130 
recreational Bowl we don't give them
these<00:04:54.340> too<00:04:54.580> often<00:04:54.940> because<00:04:55.570> they<00:04:55.780> tend<00:04:56.020> to

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
these too often because they tend to

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.770 
these too often because they tend to
crack<00:04:56.530> teeth<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.010> whatnot<00:04:57.280> but<00:04:57.850> he<00:04:58.450> does<00:04:58.600> like

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
crack teeth and whatnot but he does like

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.040 
crack teeth and whatnot but he does like
to<00:04:58.900> chew<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.200> them<00:04:59.350> so<00:04:59.500> we<00:04:59.620> get

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.170 

this<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:06.040> mr.<00:05:07.040> neat<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.490> don't<00:05:07.940> even<00:05:08.120> know

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
this is mr. neat I don't even know

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.570 
this is mr. neat I don't even know
what's<00:05:08.360> in<00:05:08.420> this<00:05:08.570> looks<00:05:08.810> like<00:05:08.930> liver<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.800> some

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
what's in this looks like liver and some

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.970 
what's in this looks like liver and some
heart<00:05:10.820> so<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.720> might<00:05:11.840> be<00:05:11.870> some<00:05:12.200> just<00:05:12.440> old<00:05:12.620> fold

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
heart so it might be some just old fold

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.800 
heart so it might be some just old fold
chunks<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.460> liver<00:05:13.730> and<00:05:14.000> old<00:05:14.120> trunk<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:14.480> hard<00:05:14.660> in

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
chunks of liver and old trunk so hard in

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.840 
chunks of liver and old trunk so hard in
here<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.200> all<00:05:15.650> we<00:05:15.770> do<00:05:15.890> is<00:05:15.920> we<00:05:16.100> bag<00:05:16.370> them<00:05:16.490> up<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.790> a

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
here so all we do is we bag them up in a

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.240 
here so all we do is we bag them up in a
little<00:05:16.970> bag<00:05:17.150> like<00:05:17.450> this<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.900> then<00:05:18.620> we'll<00:05:19.070> just

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
little bag like this and then we'll just

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.950 
little bag like this and then we'll just
take<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.430> out<00:05:19.580> seven<00:05:19.910> in<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.060> bowl<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.570> defrost

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
take it out seven in a bowl to defrost

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.510 
take it out seven in a bowl to defrost
it<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:24.430> that's<00:05:25.430> another<00:05:25.670> marrow<00:05:25.970> bone<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:28.400> in

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
it and that's another marrow bone and in

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.250 
it and that's another marrow bone and in
here<00:05:28.820> at<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.060> same<00:05:29.300> thing<00:05:29.540> more<00:05:29.750> liver<00:05:29.990> and

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
more heart just some leftovers of

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.840 
more heart just some leftovers of
somewhere<00:05:33.740> making<00:05:38.680> so<00:05:39.680> sorry<00:05:40.160> about<00:05:40.310> that<00:05:40.340> how

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
somewhere making so sorry about that how

somewhere making so sorry about that how
do<00:05:40.910> I<00:05:42.130> open<00:05:43.130> up<00:05:43.280> that<00:05:43.460> bag<00:05:43.670> but<00:05:44.000> inside<00:05:44.540> that

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
do I open up that bag but inside that

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.250 
do I open up that bag but inside that
bag<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.200> how<00:05:45.410> we<00:05:45.470> get<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.920> organ<00:05:46.580> mixtures<00:05:47.260> it

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
bag is how we get the organ mixtures it

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.230 
bag is how we get the organ mixtures it
just<00:05:48.440> comes<00:05:48.740> in<00:05:49.040> a<00:05:49.430> big<00:05:49.580> block<00:05:49.820> like<00:05:50.060> this<00:05:50.320> and

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
just comes in a big block like this and

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.540 
just comes in a big block like this and
that<00:05:53.240> there<00:05:53.480> will<00:05:53.660> probably<00:05:53.870> last<00:05:54.140> them<00:05:54.550> how

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
that there will probably last them how

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.770 
that there will probably last them how
long<00:05:55.700> would<00:05:55.820> you<00:05:55.940> say<00:05:56.060> a<00:05:56.090> block<00:05:56.450> like<00:05:56.600> that

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
long would you say a block like that

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.750 
long would you say a block like that
last<00:05:56.990> of<00:05:57.170> them<00:05:57.460> maybe<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.520> week<00:05:58.700> and<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:58.910> half<00:06:00.760> so

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
last of them maybe a week and a half so

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.410 
last of them maybe a week and a half so
we<00:06:01.850> give<00:06:01.970> maybe<00:06:02.300> like<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:03.130> don't<00:06:04.130> know<00:06:04.310> well<00:06:05.300> you

we give maybe like I don't know well you

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.970 
we give maybe like I don't know well you
saw<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.630> piece<00:06:05.870> that<00:06:05.930> we<00:06:06.200> give<00:06:06.350> anyways

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.560 
saw the piece that we give anyways
that's<00:06:07.130> how<00:06:07.250> it<00:06:07.340> comes<00:06:07.490> we<00:06:07.700> just<00:06:07.880> wants<00:06:08.480> a
