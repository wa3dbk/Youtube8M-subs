 [Music] 

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.039
 said this we do not go with angelina she 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.870
 prepares us an arch was left for the day 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:10.690
 from the mother if you want to look good with 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.790
 Mom would make it a good gift to us 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 teaches how to make a property more 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's see decent 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.079
 [Music] 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 hello my name is angelina and today we are going to 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 see what was more 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.850
 it's a technique that the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.610
 Japanese to carry everything that 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.390
 nature inside as they 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 They are very nature lovers and they are 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.660
 I really like what you see in general 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.030
 outside inside the houses 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.910
 for tea ceremony and everything good 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.160
 Japanese philosophy that means is 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.269
 but use houseplants 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.730
 you can also use plants 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:04.860
 aromatic and is a simple technique of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.259
 perform so we do not need to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.410
 pots because we're going to do that to 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.920
 we are going to use a substrate 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.830
 specific to the coquette more consists 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.830
 in mixing four parts of peat three 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.590
 of hangover part of mini lecca and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.600
 half part of coarse flour is mixed 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.420
 everything gets wet 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.290
 and with that we can begin reviewing 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.259
 the things we will take the floor 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.860
 we are going to wet the substrate in which 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.229
 find we're going to be putting together a ball and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.009
 After a while we will go living this 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.619
 substrate that we put together always wet for 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.229
 that came out better let's give it the form 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.920
 that we want in this case the most common 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.510
 is to use the plants 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.200
 in rounded form 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.210
 and then we're going to use yarn and we're going to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.450
 proceed to what is called the stew of 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.740
 the coca lady that involves wrapping her coke 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.200
 lady on all sides with the thread one 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.349
 way of tied 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.180
 then we go to once we have it 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.980
 cooked we are going to incorporate a lot of the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.650
 surface we cover it with lugo always 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.140
 wet so that it is well attached to the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.690
 Coke 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.790
 in this way we have our most ready 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.560
 once we have it finished with the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 mojo let's try to keep it 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.340
 always wet and depending on the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.110
 kind of thing we're going to perform 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.630
 the risks in the case of plants 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 interior that will irrigate approximately 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.570
 every 7 10 days and the irrigation consists of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.700
 submerge lake that lady in a bucket with 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:59.310
 water for about 5 minutes 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.380
 we can take into account from the moment 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.290
 that stops making bubbles there is the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 When we remove it, we let it drain 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.440
 the surplus water and we place it on 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.440
 a stand or a dish for what 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.340
 the fertilizer of the plants is made 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.530
 through irrigation and for this we can 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.930
 use a compost tea although the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.930
 compound man and submerge the table 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.950
 and I hope you like it and that you do it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 because it is very good to be irrigators 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.920
 and life 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.920
 solidarity 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.000
 and trust are transmitted from person 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.000
 a person
