00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so that's not that all means anything i

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.240 
so that's not that all means anything i
still<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.140> enough<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.950> clash<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
still have enough time for clash of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.039 
still have enough time for clash of
lords<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.759> course<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.860> um<00:01:52.860> i<00:01:53.570> guess<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
lords of course and um i guess it's a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.899 
lords of course and um i guess it's a
pretty<00:01:55.290> nice<00:01:55.530> idea<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.340> something<00:01:56.369> else

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
pretty nice idea to do something else

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.950 
pretty nice idea to do something else
also<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.960> i<00:01:58.259> guess<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.189> fun<00:01:59.549> and

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
also because i guess it will be fun and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
also because i guess it will be fun and
maybe<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> also<00:02:01.350> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.430> not

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
maybe you also want to see that if not

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.950 
maybe you also want to see that if not
