far<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> possibly<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> play<00:01:37.409> games

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
far as you possibly can and play games

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.050 
far as you possibly can and play games
with<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.159> give<00:01:38.369> them<00:01:38.520> treats<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
with them or give them treats at the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
with them or give them treats at the
same<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.479> doing<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:40.770> generally

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
same time doing that well generally

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.429 
same time doing that well generally
requires<00:01:41.549> two<00:01:41.790> people<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
requires two people but you can do it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
requires two people but you can do it
with<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.829> person<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.670> leave<00:01:44.880> one

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
with only one person if you leave one

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.830 
with only one person if you leave one
cat<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:46.380> carrier<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> leash<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.720> go

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cat in a carrier or on a leash if you go

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840 
cat in a carrier or on a leash if you go
ahead<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> way<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.490> you'll

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
ahead and do it that way then you'll

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.130 
ahead and do it that way then you'll
find<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.299> cats<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.990> more

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
find that your cats can get more

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.510 
find that your cats can get more
comfortable<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.680> each<00:01:52.770> other<00:01:52.920> gradually

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
comfortable with each other gradually

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
comfortable with each other gradually
and<00:01:53.729> hopefully<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.869> introduce<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
and hopefully if you introduce them at a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
and hopefully if you introduce them at a
distance<00:01:55.799> you'll<00:01:56.579> find<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.909> they're<00:01:57.060> not

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
distance you'll find that they're not

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.630 
distance you'll find that they're not
having<00:01:57.329> any<00:01:57.509> aggressive<00:01:57.990> behaviors<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.500> all

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
having any aggressive behaviors at all

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
having any aggressive behaviors at all
now<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.600> decide<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:01.079> cats<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.350> doing

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
now if you decide your cats are doing

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.350 
now if you decide your cats are doing
well<00:02:01.710> together<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.219> still<00:02:02.729> recommend<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
well together I still recommend that you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
well together I still recommend that you
don't<00:02:03.570> leave<00:02:03.719> them<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:03.960> alone<00:02:04.380> together<00:02:04.590> for

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
don't leave them out alone together for

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
don't leave them out alone together for
at<00:02:05.130> least<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> first<00:02:05.670> two<00:02:05.880> weeks<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
at least the first two weeks because it

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.570 
at least the first two weeks because it
takes<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.590> long<00:02:07.740> time<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.979> casting<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
takes a long time for casting a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.499 
takes a long time for casting a
comfortable<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.119> each<00:02:09.239> other

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
comfortable with each other

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.589 
comfortable with each other
in<00:02:09.629> fact<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.649> feral<00:02:11.610> cat<00:02:11.819> colonies<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
in fact in feral cat colonies it can

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.960 
in fact in feral cat colonies it can
take<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.050> nine<00:02:13.200> months<00:02:13.560> for

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
take up to nine months for

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.490 
take up to nine months for
to<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.210> welcomed<00:02:14.630> into<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> colony<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to be welcomed into the colony and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.320 
to be welcomed into the colony and
during<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.220> time<00:02:16.490> they're<00:02:16.790> really<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
during that time they're really on the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.240 
during that time they're really on the
periphery<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.050> there<00:02:18.230> may<00:02:18.350> be<00:02:18.380> subject<00:02:19.130> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
periphery and there may be subject of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.790 
periphery and there may be subject of
lots<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.520> attacks<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.350> important<00:02:21.740> to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
lots of attacks so it's important to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440 
lots of attacks so it's important to
remember<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.550> type<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.820> process<00:02:23.090> can

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
remember that this type of process can

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.540 
remember that this type of process can
take<00:02:23.660> some<00:02:23.870> time<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.890> end<00:02:24.920> they<00:02:25.400> may

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
take some time but in the end they may

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.640 
take some time but in the end they may
get<00:02:25.670> along<00:02:25.970> if<00:02:26.210> you<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.750> things<00:02:26.960> gradually<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
get along if you do things gradually and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.290 
get along if you do things gradually and
that's<00:02:28.190> how<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.550> help<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:28.850> cat<00:02:29.060> get

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
that's how you can help your cat get

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.110 
that's how you can help your cat get
along<00:02:29.510> with<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> new<00:02:29.900> cat
