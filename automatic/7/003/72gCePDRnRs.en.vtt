00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
my favorite way to use our bottle is

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.760 
my favorite way to use our bottle is
we're<00:01:04.149> going<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.329> put<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.570> ingredients<00:01:04.809> right

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
into the bottle and we're going to use

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.140 
into the bottle and we're going to use
the<00:01:08.079> basket<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.250> screen<00:01:09.520> inside<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.120> a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
the basket and the screen inside is a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.540 
the basket and the screen inside is a
double<00:01:10.510> infuser<00:01:10.870> so<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.290> when<00:01:11.409> we<00:01:11.500> drink<00:01:11.770> we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
double infuser so that when we drink we

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.320 
double infuser so that when we drink we
don't<00:01:12.700> get<00:01:12.820> any<00:01:12.970> other<00:01:13.180> pieces<00:01:13.570> into<00:01:13.870> our<00:01:14.050> No

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
don't get any other pieces into our No

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.370 
don't get any other pieces into our No
