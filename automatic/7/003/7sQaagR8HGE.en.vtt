00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.060
 all these products are actually 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.340
 food supplements allegedly 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.980
 which have been tested by a 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.300
 Toulouse laboratory and analyzes 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.510
 revealed that they actually contained 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.430
 overdose or 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.990
 drugs that are downright forbidden 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.279
 in france and europe ask in 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.410
 slimming products we found 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.300
 hungry cuts in some who those 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.470
 that have been banned since a good 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 moment because it cause a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 excess mortality among obese 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.530
 there are also carcinogenic laxatives 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.600
 in products to fight against 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.000
 Erectile dysfunction 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.300
 but there are active molecules that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.309
 mimics that of viagra or cialis the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.800
 more famous and worse yet there are 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.750
 analogous molecules that are supposed to have 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.120
 the same properties but have not 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.089
 never been tested in humans and as 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.260
 explain it and the doctors we have 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.329
 interviewed for this file 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.010
 consumption of these drugs without 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.309
 know can have real effect on the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.789
 health 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.040
 there have been cases in singapore with 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.810
 traffic supplements and who 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.009
 actually ended with 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 comas and dead and coffee that is 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.860
 supposed to promote erection 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.259
 it's like a kind of coffee 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.430
 this time that is done to lose weight 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.350
 other different authorities 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.210
 sanitary conditions that are concerned in fact 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.950
 by this problem rather refer to the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.530
 ball we get the impression that the number 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.360
 analyzed much lower than the number of 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.430
 products that can happen on the on 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.479
 the French market anyway they 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.610
 feel they can not 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.680
 fight the scale of this fraud 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.719
 and it's a policy that is very 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.060
 different from that of the f10 and 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.090
 american food and drug 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.070
 administration since it 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.810
 years regularly launches alerts 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.009
 in which it warns the public of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.689
 do not consume certain types of 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.219
 products and so she can perfectly 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.780
 take a product like this to say 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.590
 that she did an analysis and 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.689
 advisors 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.950
 to Americans to consume in France 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.799
 it's not thinkable because for 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.840
 to act requires that the manufacturer or 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.000
 the director of the French market is 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.940
 whom he can act and seize in 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.709
 france or our investigation has shown that the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.750
 most manufacturers or transmitters 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.420
 on the market was probably in Asia 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.620
 their sites are extremely volatile 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.099
 they open them they exchange he is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 closed 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.360
 product names also change 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.319
 the names of the manufacturers' addresses 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.540
 on the packages are sometimes 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.420
 completely dummy or really reduced 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.440
 to the simplest expression your code to 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.209
 science and the future we thought 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.819
 it was time to launch the alert 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.560
 as the professor says badly and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.379
 martineau from paul sabatier university 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.040
 Toulouse is a real problem 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.040
 public health
