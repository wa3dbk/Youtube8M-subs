we got going on afterwards
you're<00:00:56.309> gonna<00:00:56.399> pry<00:00:57.680> all<00:00:58.680> around<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.609> nice

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you're gonna pry all around here nice

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
you're gonna pry all around here nice
and<00:01:00.329> slow<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.660> easy<00:01:01.140> until<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and slow and easy until you see the

and slow and easy until you see the
black<00:01:02.510> see<00:01:03.510> how<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> white<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.260> would

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
black see how this is white this would

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
black see how this is white this would
be<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> solid<00:01:04.920> black<00:01:05.369> color<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.420> it'd<00:01:06.540> be

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
be a solid black color because it'd be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.920 
be a solid black color because it'd be
bonded<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> glue<00:01:08.750> basically<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
bonded with the glue basically what I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
bonded with the glue basically what I
did<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.920> part<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:12.689> part

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
did was I put this part and this part

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
did was I put this part and this part
was<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.320> top<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.000> does<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.240> got<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
was on top of this so what does I got a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.039 
was on top of this so what does I got a
screwdriver<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:17.509> went<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> got

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
screwdriver I went like this and got

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
screwdriver I went like this and got
under<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.500> flipped<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.970> was

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
under it and flipped it so now this was

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
under it and flipped it so now this was
on<00:01:21.990> top<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> knew<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> seal<00:01:23.580> was

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
on top of this so I knew the seal was

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.370 
on top of this so I knew the seal was
broken

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
broken

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.910 
broken
you<00:01:25.380> worked<00:01:25.560> yourself<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.130> around

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
you worked yourself all the way around

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.600 
you worked yourself all the way around
and<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.310> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and that's what you get this is this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.800 
and that's what you get this is this
because<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.450> headlight

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
because this is your headlight

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.319 
because this is your headlight
adjustment<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> stays<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.220> part<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
adjustment that stays as part of the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.920 
adjustment that stays as part of the
frame<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> headlight<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
frame of the headlight and this is the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
frame of the headlight and this is the
overall<00:01:40.320> outline<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.329> now<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.360> get<00:01:42.600> behind

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
overall outline of it now you get behind

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
overall outline of it now you get behind
the<00:01:43.020> reflector<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.009> LED<00:01:44.159> strip

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the reflector on it put an LED strip

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.540 
something to go back on whoa
so<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.819> have<00:02:49.000> something<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.450> go<00:02:49.599> back<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
so you have something to go back on the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.400 
so you have something to go back on the
placement<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.989> move<00:02:53.140> something

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
placement you have to move something

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.809 
placement you have to move something
over<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.920> basically<00:02:57.280> what's<00:02:57.519> gonna<00:02:57.610> be

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
over that's basically what's gonna be

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.559 
over that's basically what's gonna be
like<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:03.430> let's<00:03:03.489> think<00:03:03.640> about<00:03:03.730> painting<00:03:04.300> in

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
like now let's think about painting in

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.350 
like now let's think about painting in
between<00:03:04.959> black<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.099> from<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.819> distance<00:03:07.239> you

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
between black but from a distance you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.449 
between black but from a distance you
know<00:03:07.450> you're<00:03:07.569> gonna<00:03:07.660> notice<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.310> what<00:03:09.310> we're

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
don't think it looks too bad and then

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.160 
don't think it looks too bad and then
when<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.190> look<00:03:30.340> at<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.610> it's<00:03:31.150> all<00:03:31.330> inside<00:03:31.870> you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
when you look at it it's all inside you

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.270 
when you look at it it's all inside you
can't<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.650> anything<00:03:32.890> it's<00:03:33.310> all<00:03:33.489> smooth

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
