lumia<00:00:13.519> 720<00:00:14.209> I<00:00:14.450> think<00:00:14.870> it's<00:00:14.990> more<00:00:15.049> like<00:00:15.320> a

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
lumia 720 I think it's more like a

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.800 
lumia 720 I think it's more like a
middle<00:00:16.250> class<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.940> smartphone<00:00:17.570> running

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
middle class a smartphone running

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.040 
middle class a smartphone running
Windows<00:00:18.590> Phone<00:00:18.890> 8<00:00:19.190> the<00:00:19.940> device<00:00:20.270> itself<00:00:20.510> is

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
Windows Phone 8 the device itself is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.180 
Windows Phone 8 the device itself is
just<00:00:21.260> very<00:00:21.860> light<00:00:22.220> it<00:00:22.550> comes<00:00:22.820> in<00:00:23.000> this<00:00:23.170> nice

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
just very light it comes in this nice

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.580 
just very light it comes in this nice
Lumia<00:00:25.330> design<00:00:26.330> that<00:00:27.050> we<00:00:27.140> already<00:00:27.260> know<00:00:27.560> from

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
Lumia design that we already know from

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.310 
Lumia design that we already know from
the<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.310> 20<00:00:29.030> or<00:00:29.060> from<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.600> 920<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:30.520> comes<00:00:31.520> with<00:00:31.610> a

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
the a 20 or from the 920 I comes with a

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.490 
the a 20 or from the 920 I comes with a
4.3<00:00:33.320> inch<00:00:33.640> display<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.080> still<00:00:36.080> trying<00:00:36.410> to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
4.3 inch display and still trying to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900 
4.3 inch display and still trying to
figure<00:00:36.680> out<00:00:36.800> about<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.280> resolution<00:00:37.760> but<00:00:37.850> I

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
figure out about the resolution but I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.810 
figure out about the resolution but I
would<00:00:38.090> guess<00:00:38.120> it's<00:00:38.420> more<00:00:38.600> like<00:00:38.750> an<00:00:38.840> 800<00:00:39.350> x<00:00:39.829> 480

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
would guess it's more like an 800 x 480

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.930 
would guess it's more like an 800 x 480
so<00:00:41.690> we<00:00:41.870> would<00:00:41.990> expect<00:00:42.020> a<00:00:42.710> Qualcomm<00:00:43.400> SOC<00:00:43.880> in

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
so we would expect a Qualcomm SOC in

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.110 
so we would expect a Qualcomm SOC in
here<00:00:44.420> should<00:00:44.930> be<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.489> snapdragon<00:00:46.489> fortunately

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
here should be a snapdragon fortunately

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.380 
here should be a snapdragon fortunately
Nokia<00:00:47.540> didn't<00:00:48.290> release<00:00:48.680> any<00:00:49.390> specifications

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
Nokia didn't release any specifications

Nokia didn't release any specifications
of<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.100> might<00:00:52.310> be<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:53.360> 512mb<00:00:54.200> of<00:00:54.649> ram

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
of it so it might be the 512mb of ram

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.130 
of it so it might be the 512mb of ram
and<00:00:55.489> 16<00:00:56.210> gigabyte<00:00:56.630> of<00:00:56.870> our<00:00:57.680> internal<00:00:58.250> storage

was<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.350> resolution<00:01:24.859> of<00:01:24.889> the<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.399> camera

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
was the resolution of the of the camera

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.810 
was the resolution of the of the camera
on<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.880> back

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.510 

it's<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.970> 6.7<00:01:30.830> megapixel<00:01:31.830> camera<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> comes

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's a 6.7 megapixel camera it comes

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
it's a 6.7 megapixel camera it comes
with<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> cults<00:01:33.090> highest<00:01:33.390> lens<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.470> can

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
with the cults highest lens and you can

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
with the cults highest lens and you can
definitely<00:01:34.830> imagine<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> comes<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
definitely imagine that it comes with a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.620 
definitely imagine that it comes with a
decent<00:01:37.340> low-light<00:01:38.340> capabilities<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.540> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
decent low-light capabilities that we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350 
decent low-light capabilities that we
already<00:01:39.750> saw<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> Lumia<00:01:41.130> 920<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:42.060> even<00:01:42.299> on

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
already saw on the Lumia 920 or even on

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
already saw on the Lumia 920 or even on
the<00:01:42.450> PureView<00:01:42.869> 808<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> phone<00:01:44.280> camera

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the PureView 808 and on the phone camera

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.899 
the PureView 808 and on the phone camera
we<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.970> 12<00:01:45.360> mega<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.530> 2<00:01:46.710> megapixel<00:01:48.799> ok

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
we have 12 mega that's a 2 megapixel ok

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.160 
we have 12 mega that's a 2 megapixel ok
so<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.119> quite<00:01:51.330> interesting<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> 2

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so that's quite interesting it's a 2

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
so that's quite interesting it's a 2
megapixel<00:01:52.289> camera<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.610> getting<00:01:53.880> its<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
megapixel camera what is getting its a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.389 
megapixel camera what is getting its a
wide<00:01:54.630> angle<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:55.979> getting<00:01:56.250> an

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
wide angle one but you're getting an

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
wide angle one but you're getting an
auto<00:01:56.640> crop<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.479> 1.3<00:01:58.020> megapixel

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
auto crop on this to 1.3 megapixel

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340 
auto crop on this to 1.3 megapixel
