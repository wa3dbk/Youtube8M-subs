00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.740
 then I will teach it little by little 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 i 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.350
 I have 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.350
 the song starts here 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 ah 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 i 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.940
 after this one 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.930
 Y 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 Y 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.939
 then 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.939
 and more 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.580
 one 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.680
 we reject the sixth string in the third 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.040
 fret and the first string the second 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.040
 fret 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 whole would be 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.980
 i 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 again 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.790
 Y 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.560
 then we would move to make a side 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.239
 to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.170
 i 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.790
 and then again 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.790
 Y 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.900
 it's just like that but when the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.900
 Minister 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.350
 whole that said 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.350
 min 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:05.920
 finally we would go to the end what is 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.920
 on the fifth fret of the fifth string 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 and 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.930
 Y 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.700
 and finally 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.840
 nothing more then it would be with a little bit of 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.500
 JCE practice and what will draw all 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.500
 directly 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.099
 d 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.350
 for nothing else will surely come 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.320
