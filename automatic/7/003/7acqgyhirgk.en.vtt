00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.269
 hello everyone welcome to the east channel 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.210
 is the design that we are going to see today I hope 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:13.120
 like it here I show you how 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.510
 we started the steps to put nails 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.690
 acrylics here I am running cuticles 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.840
 removing the perigee removing the brightness 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.840
 of the nail and removing excesses of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.350
 powder with a brush for manicure with 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.600
 a gauze and alcohol this I say because 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.180
 I have been asked a lot in other videos 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.780
 that if I do these steps if I do them 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.270
 but I often fail to show them or 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.660
 put these shots in the video as to 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.270
 that the video is not made so long but 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.630
 if I always do these forms that 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 I'm using here are those of harmony 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.670
 are the ones that I have used lately and I 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.510
 they have loved they are very good they live 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.720
 very well and are very resistant at the time 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.970
 to put the acrylic does not get out of place 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.400
 just as you leave them like this they always stay 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.810
 then I recommend them now they are my 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.329
 favorites 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.200
 in this way I am showing what 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:16.320
 I will use in the design and I will 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.570
 use four colors of the collection 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.579
 organic neilson water that's one of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.979
 my favorites from those of organic has 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.830
 some beautiful colors and I'm also going to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.200
 use a few organic colors for a 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.270
 Third dimension 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 all these colors and all the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.829
 materials that I'm using in this 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.780
 I'm going to leave them in the box 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.790
 description for them to look at 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.880
 here already in the design what I'm 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.659
 doing is a reverse technique or 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.710
 then the almond and then as always 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.830
 I make the almond in two pearls one in the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.649
 area of ​​tension or in the smile and other 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.560
 in the cuticle area like these nails 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.030
 They are stiletto and I made the almond well 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.259
 very sharp and I want the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.239
 smile is very pronounced then 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.570
 here 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.540
 I'm going to just make two almonds in the USA 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.850
 rest will be in acrylic of the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.850
 Water collection in the complete nail 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.560
 here for the third dimension this is a 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.099
 I'm going to make some very basic flowers that 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.930
 I made this neon pink tone with the body 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.300
 so that it will stand out very well because as 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.810
 the acrylics that I'm using or that 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.530
 I used for the nail are 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.860
 as very soft tones far back are going to 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.650
 make you translucent tones because they are 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.800
 very transparent these colors me 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.470
 loved the idea of ​​putting something strong 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.440
 in the flowers this was the basic flower 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.959
 what I did in all the nails and then here 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.930
 and what I'm going to do is place with the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.130
 synergy this is a construction gel 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.190
 of organic nes put some stones or 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.030
 good in this case 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:11.200
 swarovski in the in the nail of the finger of 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.560
 ring this sera that is a number 16 and 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 the pink ones are a number 10 and I put it 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.060
 like making a kind of almond in 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.990
 crystals and I loved the result 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.000
 Well this is the simple design is 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.620
 a bas-relief I did not want to put more 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.050
 things over in design because I did not want 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.150
 cover what the flowers were then 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.940
 this is the result girls I hope that 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.540
