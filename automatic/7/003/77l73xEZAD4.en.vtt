waiting<00:01:20.040> years<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.090> think

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
waiting years for this one and I think

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.080 
waiting years for this one and I think
this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.549> sequel<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.580> GTA

this is going to be the sequel to GTA
san<00:01:24.330> andreas<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:25.080> GTA<00:01:25.619> 4<00:01:25.920> should<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.340> been

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
san andreas that GTA 4 should have been

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
san andreas that GTA 4 should have been
I<00:01:26.700> don't<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.330> GTA<00:01:27.720> 4<00:01:27.990> lift<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> hype

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I don't think GTA 4 lift up to the hype

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
I don't think GTA 4 lift up to the hype
really<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> obviously<00:01:30.840> has<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> recent<00:01:31.320> channel

online racing was actually quite fun and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.880 
online racing was actually quite fun and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
also the GTA races were funny as well

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.170 
also the GTA races were funny as well
because<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.340> can<00:02:01.490> get<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.760> guys<00:02:01.940> are

shooting other people which quite a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.400 
shooting other people which quite a
weird<00:02:04.220> twist<00:02:04.370> for<00:02:04.729> racing<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:06.170> yeah<00:02:06.320> i'll<00:02:06.380> be

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
because obviously that's going to be one

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.940 
because obviously that's going to be one
of<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.790> biggest<00:02:10.910> games<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.840> will<00:02:12.440> decade
