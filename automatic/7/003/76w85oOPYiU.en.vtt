it's<00:01:56.250> today<00:01:56.580> was<00:01:56.790> almost<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.900> full<00:01:58.080> gap<00:01:58.320> was

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's today was almost at full gap was

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
it's today was almost at full gap was
just<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> first<00:01:59.159> job<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.580> running<00:01:59.850> in

just from the first job and running in
the<00:02:00.390> first<00:02:00.600> group<00:02:00.869> makes<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.259> huge<00:02:01.409> difference

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the first group makes a huge difference

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.520 
the first group makes a huge difference
but<00:02:02.130> oh<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.750> looking<00:02:04.140> forward<00:02:04.380> to

Hills<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.920> tough<00:02:08.190> pill<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
Hills you know this is a tough pill to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.850 
Hills you know this is a tough pill to
make<00:02:09.179> speed<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.170> try<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.380> close<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> gap

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
make speed on it to try to close a gap

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
make speed on it to try to close a gap
so<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.580> knew<00:02:12.000> after<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> first<00:02:12.450> one<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.870> is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
so I knew after the first one that is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.470 
so I knew after the first one that is
quite<00:02:13.380> unlikely<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.550> Ted<00:02:14.940> he's<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
quite unlikely to be Ted he's just a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.180 
quite unlikely to be Ted he's just a
really<00:02:15.840> clutch<00:02:16.170> performer<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:16.800> those<00:02:16.950> kind<00:02:17.160> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
really clutch performer in those kind of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
really clutch performer in those kind of
situations<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.200> wanted<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> make<00:02:19.380> sure

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
situations but I wanted to make sure

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.960 
situations but I wanted to make sure
that<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.860> got<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> finish<00:02:20.430> line<00:02:20.580> at<00:02:20.760> least

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that what I got the finish line at least

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.640 
that what I got the finish line at least
let<00:02:21.120> him<00:02:21.209> know<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.050> was<00:02:22.200> coming<00:02:22.500> for
