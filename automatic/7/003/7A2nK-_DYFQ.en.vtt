just<00:00:20.609> sail<00:00:20.820> through<00:00:20.850> them<00:00:22.880> that's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.000> complex

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
just sail through them that's a complex

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630 
just sail through them that's a complex
question<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.619> there's<00:00:25.800> three<00:00:26.130> main

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
question but I think there's three main

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
question but I think there's three main
reasons<00:00:26.699> why<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.930> would<00:00:28.109> say<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
reasons why and I would say it's the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.339 
reasons why and I would say it's the
difference<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.699> belief<00:00:29.970> systems<00:00:30.570> the

difference in belief systems the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
difference in lifestyle and then the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
difference in belief system some of us
were<00:00:38.160> brought<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.610> thinking<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.180> okay<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
were brought up thinking it was okay to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.350 
were brought up thinking it was okay to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
display anger others were brought up

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
display anger others were brought up
that<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> wasn't<00:00:43.110> okay<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.860> perhaps

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that it wasn't okay that it was perhaps

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
that it wasn't okay that it was perhaps
one<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> seven<00:00:44.640> deadly<00:00:44.670> sins<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:46.559> we

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
one of the seven deadly sins and what we

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.760 
one of the seven deadly sins and what we
tried<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.719> often<00:00:49.140> achieve<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
tried to do we often achieve and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
tried to do we often achieve and
therefore<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> people<00:00:51.059> who've<00:00:51.210> been<00:00:51.360> trying

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
therefore and people who've been trying

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
therefore and people who've been trying
to<00:00:51.690> control<00:00:51.989> their<00:00:52.199> temper<00:00:52.559> from<00:00:53.129> nehi<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to control their temper from nehi can

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.290 
to control their temper from nehi can
perhaps<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> better<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:56.520> belief<00:00:56.789> systems

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
perhaps do it better also belief systems

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.139 
perhaps do it better also belief systems
about<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> realistic<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.670> realistic

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
about what is realistic is it realistic

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
about what is realistic is it realistic
to<00:01:00.420> expect<00:01:00.710> other<00:01:01.710> people<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.370> perfect<00:01:02.850> or

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to expect other people to be perfect or

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.080 
to expect other people to be perfect or
not<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.660> example<00:01:03.690> i<00:01:04.460> talked<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.489> lifestyle

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
not for example i talked about lifestyle

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
not for example i talked about lifestyle
stress<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.840> we're<00:01:06.990> under<00:01:07.200> stress<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.400> are

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
stress if we're under stress then we are

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
stress if we're under stress then we are
far<00:01:08.700> more<00:01:08.729> likely<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.390> explode<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.560> then

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
far more likely to explode and then

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429 
far more likely to explode and then
finally<00:01:11.729> background<00:01:12.299> i<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.780> must<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
finally background i think must not be

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.399 
finally background i think must not be
underestimated<00:01:14.119> when<00:01:15.119> people<00:01:15.659> explode<00:01:16.200> in

underestimated when people explode in

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.160 
underestimated when people explode in
anger<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.090> feel<00:01:18.420> generally

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
anger it's because they feel generally

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
anger it's because they feel generally
they<00:01:19.710> perceive<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> threat<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> fight

flight<00:01:21.900> freeze<00:01:22.290> reaction<00:01:22.890> kicks<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
flight freeze reaction kicks in and the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.230 
flight freeze reaction kicks in and the
brain<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> associative<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.610> more<00:01:26.820> trauma

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
brain is associative so the more trauma

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
brain is associative so the more trauma
