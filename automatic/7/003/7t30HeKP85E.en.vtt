00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.589
 minecraft is welcome here to one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.790
 new plugin conception of the 107 yes 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.300
 we had a long time ago 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 time the plug in trieste presented and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.570
 now just want it again 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.299
 because the tutorial namely quite 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.190
 is pretty old and yes ask that now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.369
 namely not knowing what is like it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.590
 gss is a plugin for your server 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.320
 that works roughly like that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 tempomat and I show you now as 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.570
 you have the game in part intro and after 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 the intro then comes the whole 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 installation and so on us 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.719
 let's start what do we do it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.910
 of course we need an ax and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.040
 trees is clear 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.020
 namely in the theme of fashion it is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 if we just cut down the tree now 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 collapses and it happens 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 nothing further here at the triest plugin 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 it is quite different the favorite part 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 gone but boss disappear naturally 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 after currently a seedling settles 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.799
 automatically and the ax goes 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.689
 durability just as we stop 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.920
 So breaking down the tree would be the same 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.439
 many bridges we break down 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.720
 just as much durability would be 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.549
 then go down as normal digestive worries 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.890
 Let's take the wood ax and also here 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.799
 Here and there we already see one 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 bigger piece is gone and then 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.350
 go and see the huge monster tree 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.820
 and the ax has crashed, too 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.579
 again sipplinger sat down 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.229
 and all the wood came down sometimes 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.049
 also app down and if now 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 people of st no it is completely plugin 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.110
 no that's not true because it is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 that's how clever they sit the michal 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.369
 the pests and it will be the same 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.860
 many pests or apples still down 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.590
 as well as normal drops of wine so there 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.990
 nothing comes of it and yes then of course 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.000
 also keep up and gold and diamonds 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 it's just the same and has with all 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.520
 trees and that's what I find relative 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.370
 practically because it is of course partly 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.990
 also somewhere realistic than 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.000
 so normal in minecraft then just 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.970
 so trees floating in the air small 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.660
 well I hope the intel has you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.220
 like 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.400
 then I want to say something much fun 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.620
 now with our new intro and yes 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.500
 I'm not that new anymore 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.550
 do not know when you watched the video 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.320
 still have fun with the intro 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.230
 undercutting say just see us 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.620
 both installation on your bucket 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.620
 server 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.940
 so and after that wonderful intro 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.340
 they are also on the app wiggling web 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 page on the page of tri it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.180
 yes, here are a few more 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.740
 explanations and also a few park 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.300
 you can come to you does not get in 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.860
 maybe read through this opportunity once 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.590
 But they are not really that way 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.840
 important for and in game actually out 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.220
 the form shown in troja and therefore 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.810
 the most important button on this page 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 is of course the download button 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.860
 Just have a sound and then again 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.690
 to not click on the advertisement, the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.960
 We should be here right now 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.250
 then let your file save 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.540
 The animal was downloaded then 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.980
 We do a bit of small target us 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.490
 just on the desktop i have now 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.280
 reared and then I can 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.900
 go down here yes we have here 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.120
 few things in there but we leave 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.010
 just as they are and then then 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.480
 we may open our servers 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.640
 Do you have the server synonymous with guitar duo 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.280
 then you have to keep in the web 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.900
 login interface and then stop 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.610
 just now the steps just like that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.920
 Do like you guys here now 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.540
 show it should have no idea 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.220
 rather keep your fingers away from it 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.780
 there can also be a few mistakes 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.890
 this might not be your server 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.080
 are too good 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.780
 We still go first in the plug 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.580
 into the goal just triste in and then 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.010
 it is already finished we stood 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.780
 server just new that is now 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.270
 just a home server so one 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.750
 macho server and here we see too 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.720
 beautiful 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.290
 I had to search for Trieste 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.630
 loaded in the version 5.4 points 2 the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.730
 everything is so right then we still go 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.930
 times in the sound sun in and then 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.669
 here are a few folders 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.720
 We have come to this and we are going in here 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.959
 The teams are organized 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480
 there we will the config file again 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.860
 right click open with moped + + one 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.120
 the best programs for such files 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.300
 and then we are also in the config 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.400
 file 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.050
 What does that mean exactly here? 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.260
 we set a lot of little things 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.880
 the work in the game in the game again 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.360
 German and English convey that yes 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.789
 Of course it's good too 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.409
 but the most important are simply too 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.210
 leave everything here is perfect 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.250
 but still I want it 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.849
 of course you should time again 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.439
 trees are automatically destroyed yes 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.659
 Of course first on tour is yes too 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.250
 right so if now but has not 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.469
 then want the plug-in actually 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.949
 also pointless and yes she could 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.479
 but often if no positions and then 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.500
 let's go further down 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.530
 should the prisoners be set again? 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.990
 be here should open up apples 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.909
 she is also on tour and falling down 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.039
 here mcm mu that's always one 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.090
 plug-in son no skill plugin link 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.680
 of it summer and in the video 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.330
 description and again how to 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.620
 a server makes is always and 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.870
 in the like to have the description 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.509
 we also made videos here 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.610
 to mmo should get points for it 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.349
 fell for trees yes or no you have to 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.270
 decide for yourself in this case it is 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:38.969
 set here for year then 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.669
 which trees should now automatically 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:45.849
 The trees are destroyed here 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.469
 species THAT CONDITION jungle large already built 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.629
 eicher and keeps the snow or the 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.580
 Spruce trees run this year 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.319
 could also if you say no the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.080
 big ones are better always to win 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:02.379
 destroyed by hand if then go 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.199
 we just do it in case of course that way 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:08.020
 not written fort so written 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.500
 and yes I want everything but still 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.919
 poor that start automatically too 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.319
 can 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.089
 so then we go down a bit 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.830
 the lasso was best now first 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:22.210
 everything as it is and then what for 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.270
 species should then sit down again 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.189
 So again , which tree is sitting 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.680
 should again guys their sampling 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:32.289
 sit down here it could be the same 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.469
 again and then undress with 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.589
 what tools and destroy if you do that 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:40.689
 Now with the diamond as a wood ax 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:42.879
 with the gold axle with iron ax or 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.430
 to destroy it with the battle ax 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.490
 if you say no the diamond ax 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.660
 is totally there that makes everything 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.850
 already remove so fast then and yes 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.790
 I want to leave anyway and 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.740
 this is already the case again 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.390
 you said yes with the shovel could 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.160
 that could scannell me too 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.190
 But from there would have to be quite 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.850
 know exactly how it is here 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.960
 is written so with this 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.570
 underlined etc 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.090
 best to leave and then go too 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.300
 do not save anything as bad as it does 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.250
 best off and close that afterwards 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.160
 Let's just write in the 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:24.540
 console reloaded complete as is and 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.670
 then stands again and everything is 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.800
 Perfect as it is works for you 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.110
 on the server and just say that 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.640
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.560
 if yes gives this video synonymous one 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.270
 thumbs up and me just be up 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.630
 to the next video of joint so 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.630
 so far
