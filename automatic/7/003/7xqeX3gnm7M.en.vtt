have been riding this bike for three
weeks<00:00:16.710> now<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.880> started<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.359> notice<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
weeks now and we started to notice that

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260 
weeks now and we started to notice that
the<00:00:19.230> front<00:00:19.529> brakes<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.789> starting<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> feel

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the front brakes that's starting to feel

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.040 
the front brakes that's starting to feel
a<00:00:21.330> little<00:00:21.359> spongy<00:00:22.789> this<00:00:23.789> could<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.000> due<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.300> one

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
a little spongy this could be due to one

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.339 
a little spongy this could be due to one
of<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> few<00:00:25.380> factors<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.880> Japanese<00:00:27.390> bikes<00:00:27.810> come

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
of a few factors the Japanese bikes come

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.880 
of a few factors the Japanese bikes come
stock<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.390> rubber<00:00:30.390> brake<00:00:30.990> lines<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
stock with rubber brake lines as you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.190 
stock with rubber brake lines as you can
see<00:00:32.099> down<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.520> unlike<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> European<00:00:33.989> bikes

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
see down there unlike the European bikes

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
see down there unlike the European bikes
which<00:00:34.440> come<00:00:34.739> stock<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.190> steel<00:00:36.000> braided

which come stock with steel braided
brake<00:00:36.480> lines<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.020> guess<00:00:37.710> save<00:00:38.610> money<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
brake lines I guess save money for the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.530 
brake lines I guess save money for the
Japanese<00:00:39.600> manufacturers<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:41.300> use<00:00:42.300> rubber

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
Japanese manufacturers to use rubber

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
Japanese manufacturers to use rubber
hose<00:00:42.829> usually<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.760> first

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
hose usually that's one of the first

hose usually that's one of the first
upgrades<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.989> would<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:46.680> staff

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
upgrades that we would do on our staff

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.779 
upgrades that we would do on our staff
bikes<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.329> we've<00:00:48.809> unable<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.860> source<00:00:50.309> any<00:00:50.520> as

bikes but we've unable to source any as
of<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.500> another<00:00:52.500> problem<00:00:52.739> could<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.699> air

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
of now another problem could be that air

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
of now another problem could be that air
have<00:00:54.629> gotten<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.680> brake<00:00:55.890> line<00:00:56.100> somehow

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
have gotten into the brake line somehow

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
have gotten into the brake line somehow
which<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> fairly<00:00:57.690> common<00:00:57.870> for<00:01:00.440> motorcycles

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
which is a fairly common for motorcycles

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.250 
which is a fairly common for motorcycles
in<00:01:01.559> general<00:01:01.920> another<00:01:02.789> issue<00:01:03.270> could<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
in general another issue could be that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.990 
in general another issue could be that
water<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:04.949> ending<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.580> been<00:01:05.760> raining

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
water is not ending it has been raining

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
water is not ending it has been raining
pretty<00:01:06.119> hard<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.070> condensation<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:09.500> any

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
pretty hard and condensation or any

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
pretty hard and condensation or any
leftover<00:01:11.040> rain<00:01:11.159> water<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.670> wiped<00:01:11.909> off

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
leftover rain water not wiped off

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.580 
leftover rain water not wiped off
because<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.390> somehow<00:01:12.630> made<00:01:12.930> his<00:01:13.049> way<00:01:13.200> into<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
because it somehow made his way into the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
because it somehow made his way into the
front<00:01:13.830> brakes<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> do

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
front brakes so what we're going to do

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.609 
front brakes so what we're going to do
today<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.229> try<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> fix<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:18.290> get<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.350> break

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
today to try to fix it is to get a break

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.520 
today to try to fix it is to get a break
leader<00:01:19.950> stick<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> master

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
leader stick it up here on the master

leader stick it up here on the master
cylinder<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.409> need<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> wrench

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
cylinder get that off we need a wrench

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.649 
cylinder get that off we need a wrench
to<00:01:26.040> loosen<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.000> we'll<00:01:27.270> stick<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to loosen this and we'll stick it in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.020 
to loosen this and we'll stick it in
there<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.990> try<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> pump<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> trap

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
there and try to pump some of the trap

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
there and try to pump some of the trap
air<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> hopefully<00:01:31.020> that'll<00:01:31.380> fix<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
air out and hopefully that'll fix the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859 
air out and hopefully that'll fix the
problem<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> first<00:01:33.210> thing<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> do

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
problem so the first thing we want to do

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.770 
problem so the first thing we want to do
is<00:01:34.170> shove<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.890> nozzle<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.850> pump<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
is shove this nozzle in here pump this a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
is shove this nozzle in here pump this a
couple<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.229> times<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.650> make<00:01:37.770> sure<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.159> its

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
couple of times to make sure that its

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
couple of times to make sure that its
suction<00:01:38.549> Don<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.180> we'll<00:01:39.720> need<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> second

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
suction Don and we'll need a second

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
suction Don and we'll need a second
person<00:01:40.729> power<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.210> help<00:01:42.390> me<00:01:42.450> herb<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
person power here to help me herb the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
person power here to help me herb the
front<00:01:43.350> brake<00:01:43.560> lever<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:45.799> before<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.100> open<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.790> up

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
front brake lever in before I open it up

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.290 
front brake lever in before I open it up
to<00:01:47.970> let<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> air<00:01:48.540> out

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.730 

so<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.390> turns<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.230> was<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.440> little

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so it turns out that there was a little

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.080 
so it turns out that there was a little
bit<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> air<00:01:56.130> trapped<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.760> master

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
bit of air trapped in the master

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.720 
bit of air trapped in the master
cylinder<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:58.080> top<00:01:58.350> sometimes<00:01:59.190> though<00:01:59.460> it

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
cylinder up top sometimes though it

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.880 
cylinder up top sometimes though it
could<00:01:59.910> be<00:02:00.150> there<00:02:00.750> air<00:02:01.350> bubble<00:02:01.680> could<00:02:01.800> be

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
could be there air bubble could be

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
could be there air bubble could be
actually<00:02:02.220> trapped<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> CalPERS<00:02:03.150> on<00:02:03.330> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
actually trapped in the CalPERS on the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.470 
actually trapped in the CalPERS on the
