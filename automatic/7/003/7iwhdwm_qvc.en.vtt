00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.360
 handicraft program that we have of 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.360

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.100
 title of this direct video but what 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.100
 cojones is happening here 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.649
 and then the seamstress comes back in 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.390
 in the cabin and says there will be no 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.250
 psychologist who will cure you if not the end and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.890
 you only need the first part 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.240
 will be very afraid and guys look at that the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.240
 pp have returned to faith 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.710
 we finished earlier than expected no 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.540
 you're right the apple how they go to bed 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.000
 to have apple we are left without 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.690
 words how nice 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.460
 this guy seems a little weird 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.380
 you arrive in time to take a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 milk cupcake warm 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.450
 yesterday's training 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.460
 training but everything started 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.810
 very simple I had gotten up early 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.770
 to help Isabel get her 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.439
 investors 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.750
 and I told him that there was no problem for me 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.909
 you speak to me and reached that point I decided 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.219
 stop smoking I have the free agenda 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.149
 commitments look and take a look is me 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.100
 It has happened to do a few 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.840
 prototypes when you choose your favorite 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.840
 we will design your table to scale 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.140
 and next to a box of scorpions I think 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.060
 that I wanted to bring seeing is not running and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.729
 if we already finished with this 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 Teach us the little ale but do not 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.890
 you expect too much of them what is 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.580
 what's up with them so we can go around 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.049
 to think those heads are not good 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.049
 the almonds 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.709
 it's an almond you eat now I understand 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.250
 what you say does not look like Serbian squirrels 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.250
 or is it true in Beijing and if not in little 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.590
 and now society when you see a 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.590
 person 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.560
 to me ask me and it was 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.990
 how it started on the 10th and I lost where it is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.580
 Now welcome back agent bill

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.700

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.110
 of our own existence has never 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.630
 there was a greater threat and fucking mother 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.090

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.860
 there is no shortage of peaches in tandil 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.960
 and we've found out that behind it 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.320
 is 2000 to find out what it is that 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.320
