the purpose of a pre-filter is to

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.330 
the purpose of a pre-filter is to
collect<00:00:22.090> as<00:00:22.270> much<00:00:22.450> debris<00:00:22.869> as<00:00:22.990> you<00:00:23.200> can<00:00:23.470> out<00:00:24.010> of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
collect as much debris as you can out of

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.040 
collect as much debris as you can out of
the<00:00:24.460> water<00:00:24.700> before<00:00:25.180> it<00:00:25.420> gets<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.779> your<00:00:25.930> main

the water before it gets to your main
filter<00:00:26.520> if<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.790> have<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:29.070> gravel<00:00:30.070> filter<00:00:30.250> or<00:00:30.849> a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
filter if you have a gravel filter or a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.660 
filter if you have a gravel filter or a
matte<00:00:31.300> filter<00:00:31.810> or<00:00:31.990> something<00:00:32.320> complicated

manual<00:00:33.670> filter<00:00:34.000> you<00:00:34.059> have<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.210> take<00:00:34.330> care<00:00:34.540> of

manual filter you have to take care of

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.770 
manual filter you have to take care of
sometimes<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:35.860> can<00:00:36.010> be<00:00:36.129> very<00:00:36.340> beneficial

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
sometimes that can be very beneficial

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.479 
sometimes that can be very beneficial
because<00:00:37.780> it's<00:00:38.020> if<00:00:38.470> catching<00:00:39.100> this<00:00:39.250> debris

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
because it's if catching this debris

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.970 
because it's if catching this debris
because<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:39.910> know<00:00:40.110> filter<00:00:41.110> may<00:00:41.260> take<00:00:41.470> you<00:00:41.680> and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
because you know filter may take you and

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.610 
because you know filter may take you and
all<00:00:42.070> day<00:00:42.280> long<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.699> clean<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.239> big<00:00:43.510> one<00:00:43.690> this

all day long to clean a big one this
pre-filter<00:00:45.460> will<00:00:45.670> collect<00:00:45.970> this<00:00:46.090> material

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
pre-filter will collect this material

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.390 
pre-filter will collect this material
out<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.840> there<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.440> can<00:00:47.650> clean<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.070> on<00:00:48.309> a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
out of there and you can clean that on a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.369 
out of there and you can clean that on a
more<00:00:48.550> often<00:00:48.879> basis<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.809> you<00:00:50.080> don't<00:00:50.260> have

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
more often basis so that you don't have

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.460 
more often basis so that you don't have
to<00:00:50.559> clean<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.890> big<00:00:51.040> filter<00:00:51.400> as<00:00:51.580> often<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:53.320> the

to backwash that often times will forego
a<00:00:59.470> pre-filter<00:00:59.979> just<00:01:00.790> because<00:01:01.210> it's<00:01:01.510> much

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
a pre-filter just because it's much

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.259 
a pre-filter just because it's much
easier<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:02.199> clean<00:01:02.409> a<00:01:02.549> bead<00:01:03.549> filter<00:01:03.820> twice<00:01:04.239> a

easier to clean a bead filter twice a

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.399 
easier to clean a bead filter twice a
week<00:01:04.570> than<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.409> is<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.890> clean<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:07.020> pre-filter<00:01:08.020> as

week than it is to clean a pre-filter as

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.250 
week than it is to clean a pre-filter as
off<00:01:09.130> as<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.430> might<00:01:09.580> need<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.909> be<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:11.020> there<00:01:11.170> are

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
off as it might need to be but there are

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.230 
off as it might need to be but there are
two<00:01:11.470> types<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:12.010> basically<00:01:12.700> two<00:01:12.880> types<00:01:12.909> of

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
two types of basically two types of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.910 
two types of basically two types of
pre-filters<00:01:13.840> one<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.380> just<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.770> simple

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
pre-filters one is just a simple

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.710 
pre-filters one is just a simple
settling<00:01:15.430> chamber<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.030> that's<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.299> big<00:01:16.479> box

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
settling chamber and that's a big box

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.350 
settling chamber and that's a big box
and<00:01:17.049> you'd<00:01:17.619> have<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.890> water<00:01:18.119> gravity<00:01:19.119> flow

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
and you'd have the water gravity flow

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.840 
and you'd have the water gravity flow
into<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:19.630> end<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.170> then<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.740> gets<00:01:21.340> sucked<00:01:21.670> out

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
into one end and then it gets sucked out

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.969 
into one end and then it gets sucked out
the<00:01:21.909> other<00:01:22.180> end<00:01:22.450> higher<00:01:22.780> up<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.799> allows

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
the other end higher up and it allows

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.950 
the other end higher up and it allows
the<00:01:24.189> debris<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.579> come<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.329> kind<00:01:25.539> of<00:01:25.600> settle

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
the debris to come in and kind of settle

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.319 
the debris to come in and kind of settle
to<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.170> bottom<00:01:26.460> before<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.729> gets<00:01:28.000> sucked<00:01:28.210> out

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
to the bottom before it gets sucked out

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.080 
to the bottom before it gets sucked out
the<00:01:28.390> other<00:01:28.630> end<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.649> other<00:01:29.799> one<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> vortex

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
the other end the other one is a vortex

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.179 
the other end the other one is a vortex
filter<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.810> what<00:01:32.049> it<00:01:32.140> did<00:01:32.229> it'll<00:01:32.469> be<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.680> larger

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189

it's<00:01:40.060> pulled<00:01:40.329> out<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.689> center<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.829> as<00:01:42.100> it

it's pulled out of the center so as it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.429 
it's pulled out of the center so as it

water is just sucked from the center and
as<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.240> collects<00:01:49.479> into<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.840> bottom<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.229> the

as it collects into the bottom of the
vortex<00:01:50.770> then<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.520> flush<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.759> out<00:01:52.030> at

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
vortex then you can just flush it out at

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.169 
vortex then you can just flush it out at
the<00:01:52.329> end<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:53.619> pre<00:01:53.890> filters<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
the end these pre filters the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.730 
the end these pre filters the
disadvantage<00:01:55.780> they<00:01:55.990> can<00:01:56.140> take<00:01:56.289> up<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.560> lot<00:01:56.710> of

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
disadvantage they can take up a lot of

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.609 
disadvantage they can take up a lot of
room<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.280> also<00:01:57.939> they<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.299> be<00:01:58.329> expensive<00:01:58.719> but

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
room and also they can be expensive but
