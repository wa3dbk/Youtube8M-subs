00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 good in this tutorial I'm going to teach 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.770
 how to make them wired and wireless 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.289
 what we need are the headsets of 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 these with entry 3.5 of this we are going to 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.440
 occupy a female double entry jack 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 3.5 also 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.610
 and we will take an adapter cable rsa 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.040
 of these two you do not need the cable 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.070
 we can also buy one more box 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.190
 boy who is also for the same and 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 well let's continue with this tutorial 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.490
 good 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 with these you will be able to listen to the game 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 any game that you put in the xbox what 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.370
 You will be able to hear well what it is that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.550
 we have to do 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.210
 the cable of the microphone earphones 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.100
 or whether the hearing aid that is going to be or 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.570
 you have this entry 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 are you going to put her in the chat 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.200
 compared that is well adjusted 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.920
 and the next will be the East cable 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.409
 the double entry of rca the adapter 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.590
 well this we are going to put 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.810
 and we will stay like this 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.220
 after that 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.280
 here entered the tests of the xbox there 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.259
 people who play on television and another that 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.210
 play on monitors for those who have 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.789
 adapter for the monitor we can 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.450
 use this on a normal television 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.150
 for those who play hdmi can take 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.310
 this all this plastic to be able 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 connect the two things in the xbox and so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 to be able to use them good hearing aids 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.569
 the white wire will be entered here and the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.489
 red here then the yellow will remain 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.080
 this is the one that will be connected to the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.830
 television so you can see the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.900
 image and this will make the sound you 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.160
 get to the hearing aids then here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.480
 you will hear the whole game having 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.390
 connected already all this 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.879
 well this was like making them wireframe 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.330
 Now I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:53.170
 wireless these serves you a lot for 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.549
 the games like halo because more than anything 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.180
 I did it for people who play 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.920
 halo and all that because I certainly like 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.080
 a halo 4 you hear very loud those 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.180
 steps of the person when recharging and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.790
 all that because one is a certain advantage 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.750
 to be able to hear it more easily 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.010
 Well let's continue with 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.010
 and wireless 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.420
 good 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.850
 these are the wireless ones these 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.490
 those who are here 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.320
 are the wireless this the truth is 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.000
 very simple because that is, this is the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.970
 small box that sends the signal to the room to 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.660
 the hearing aids to these is in the stool 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.540
 which is taking the signal and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.490
 you already know this one is going to be connected to 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.130
 electricity and well the truth is very 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.780
 easy on these in the wireless already 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.040
 that the pests of the xbox 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.930
 the xbox pests are connected 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.150
 the quadrille of the quartet already brings two 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.270
 white bullet tickets 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.890
 and the rock 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.720
 Finally, the yellow one is the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.050
 that is going to connect the television is very 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.950
 easy since these unlike the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.570
 wired these have for the volume 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.130
 this is the truth you hear too much 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.680
 strong and you have a certain advantage for 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.870
 the games well this as well as you 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.670
 serve with your parents they tell you low the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.070
 volume of that or something like that 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.560
 you can have these and the truth is 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.750
 they listen too loud these up 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.780
 October because they have to regulate the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.380
 sound these I made them more than anything 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.660
 because a friend wanted to enter or 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.820
 competitive in highlight birds and help you 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.130
 how to make some because these are not the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.110
 borrowed since I do not use these 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:50.080
 or anything and then I use another good 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.930
 this and then this would be all the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.780
 tutorial on how to make your own 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.350
 successes this one well as you already know how 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.280
 we put the female double entry jack 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.860
 3.5 we will occupy the connector 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.650
 of rsa 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.569
 and then this would be all the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.479
 tutorial friends I hope you have them 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.520
