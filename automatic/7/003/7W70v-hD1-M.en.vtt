over it and sanded it down but it was
still<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.900> hard<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> achieve<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.580> amount

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
still it was hard to achieve the amount

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020 
still it was hard to achieve the amount
of<00:01:09.180> bondo<00:01:09.600> stuck<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> since<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.280> lot

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
of bondo stuck on it since it was a lot

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
of bondo stuck on it since it was a lot
of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> Porsche<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.170> no<00:01:13.710> miss<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.729> the

of the Porsche was no miss it on the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
of the Porsche was no miss it on the
bottom<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.360> well<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.380> body

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
bottom as well it's not like a body

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310 
bottom as well it's not like a body
panel<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> bond<00:01:18.900> over

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740 
panel that you just put the bond over
and<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> sticks<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> lot<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> would<00:01:21.540> fall

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
