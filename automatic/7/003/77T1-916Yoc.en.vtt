when the proper temperature is reached
good<00:02:35.030> foam<00:02:35.360> will<00:02:35.630> expand<00:02:36.110> about<00:02:36.350> two<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.010> three

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
good foam will expand about two to three

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.530 
good foam will expand about two to three
times<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.940> volume<00:02:38.209> you've<00:02:38.600> sprayed

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
times the volume you've sprayed

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.670 
times the volume you've sprayed
additionally<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.840> will<00:02:41.990> not<00:02:42.230> be<00:02:42.440> easily

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
additionally it will not be easily

additionally it will not be easily
pulled<00:02:43.160> away<00:02:43.340> from<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.970> wall

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
pulled away from the wall

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.030 
pulled away from the wall
remember<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.850> foam<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.300> TAC<00:02:47.600> free<00:02:48.020> after<00:02:48.680> 30

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
remember the foam is TAC free after 30

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.729 
remember the foam is TAC free after 30
seconds

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.619 

another<00:02:56.739> helpful<00:02:57.069> technique<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.209> use<00:02:58.390> a

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
another helpful technique is to use a

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.020 
another helpful technique is to use a
flash<00:02:58.989> coat<00:02:59.409> not<00:03:00.250> everything<00:03:00.760> will<00:03:00.879> be

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
flash coat not everything will be

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.420 
flash coat not everything will be
covered<00:03:01.420> as<00:03:01.599> it's<00:03:01.900> not<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.080> full<00:03:02.500> coat<00:03:02.860> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
covered as it's not a full coat the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.580 
covered as it's not a full coat the
exothermic<00:03:04.180> reaction<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.110> foam<00:03:05.349> will

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
exothermic reaction of the foam will

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.770 
exothermic reaction of the foam will
help<00:03:05.769> heat<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.190> surface<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.420> especially

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
help heat the surface this is especially

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.630 
help heat the surface this is especially
helpful<00:03:08.230> if<00:03:08.620> you're<00:03:08.769> spreading<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.220> concrete

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
helpful if you're spreading a concrete

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.210 
helpful if you're spreading a concrete
during<00:03:10.030> colder<00:03:10.390> months<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.930> light<00:03:11.530> first<00:03:11.920> coat

during colder months a light first coat

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.830 
during colder months a light first coat
will<00:03:12.430> help<00:03:12.640> make<00:03:12.849> sure<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.209> foam<00:03:13.420> bonds

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
will help make sure the foam bonds

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.830 
will help make sure the foam bonds
correctly

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
for using spray foam in colder

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.619 
for using spray foam in colder
temperatures<00:03:23.680> you're<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:24.730> step<00:03:25.030> closer<00:03:25.300> to

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
temperatures you're one step closer to

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.839 
temperatures you're one step closer to
lower<00:03:25.840> energy<00:03:26.379> costs<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.040> more<00:03:27.250> efficient
