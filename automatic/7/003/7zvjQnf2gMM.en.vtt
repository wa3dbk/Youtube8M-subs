00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
snaps like that because there's magnets

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.800 
snaps like that because there's magnets
right<00:01:51.340> here<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.820> there's<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.030> very<00:01:52.240> very

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
right here and there's a very very

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.770 
right here and there's a very very
powerful<00:01:53.110> magnet<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.299> just<00:01:55.329> close<00:01:55.570> on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
powerful magnet so you can just close on

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.399 
powerful magnet so you can just close on
one<00:01:55.960> finger<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:58.450> snap<00:01:58.810> right<00:01:59.049> into<00:01:59.110> place

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
one finger I will snap right into place

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.889 
one finger I will snap right into place
just<00:01:59.469> like<00:01:59.799> that<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.180> case<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.479> really

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
just like that so this case is really

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.830 
just like that so this case is really
good<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.530> site<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.909> has<00:02:04.119> real<00:02:04.539> wood

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
good you to the site it has real wood

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.499 
good you to the site it has real wood
and<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.430> real<00:02:06.700> metal<00:02:06.939> if<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.240> can<00:02:07.360> hear

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
and this is real metal if you can hear

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.810 
and this is real metal if you can hear
it<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.840> real<00:02:11.080> metal<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.830> that's<00:02:12.550> why<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
it this is real metal and that's why the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.270 
it this is real metal and that's why the
price<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:13.570> high<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.470> think<00:02:14.920> this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
price is so high this is I think this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.200 
price is so high this is I think this
case<00:02:15.550> goes<00:02:15.820> for<00:02:16.120> around<00:02:16.270> 1<00:02:17.080> 95

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
case goes for around 1 95

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.000 
case goes for around 1 95
