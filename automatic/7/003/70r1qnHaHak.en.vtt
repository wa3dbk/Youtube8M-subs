but<00:00:31.489> I'm<00:00:31.609> still<00:00:31.849> were<00:00:31.970> surprised<00:00:32.390> actually

but I'm still were surprised actually

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.150 
but I'm still were surprised actually
that<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.960> difficulty<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:33.739> they've<00:00:33.920> got<00:00:34.070> an

that the difficulty that they've got an
apogee<00:00:34.550> I'll<00:00:34.700> be<00:00:34.820> interesting<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.540> see<00:00:35.720> what

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
apogee I'll be interesting to see what

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.590 
apogee I'll be interesting to see what
it's<00:00:36.050> like<00:00:36.170> not<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.410> harder<00:00:36.680> difficulty<00:00:37.600> you're

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
it's like not a harder difficulty you're

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.900 
it's like not a harder difficulty you're
not<00:00:38.720> hanging<00:00:39.080> around<00:00:39.140> but<00:00:39.710> again<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:40.640> have<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
not hanging around but again I have to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.850 
not hanging around but again I have to
see<00:00:41.060> it<00:00:41.120> as<00:00:41.360> easy<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.720> favor<00:00:41.990> to<00:00:42.140> Cole<00:00:42.320> fat<00:00:42.560> which

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
see it as easy a favor to Cole fat which

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.250 
see it as easy a favor to Cole fat which
is<00:00:42.890> playing<00:00:43.820> nice<00:00:44.060> we<00:00:44.360> hope<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.750> be<00:00:44.900> chopped

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
is playing nice we hope to be chopped

had<00:00:45.500> for<00:00:45.830> me<00:00:45.920> with<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.130> lot<00:00:46.310> easier<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.910> it

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
had for me with a lot easier and it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.910 
had for me with a lot easier and it
wasn't<00:00:47.630> the<00:00:47.750> wheel<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.450> much<00:00:50.960> much<00:00:51.470> prefer

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
wasn't the wheel so I much much prefer

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.400 
wasn't the wheel so I much much prefer
driving<00:00:52.220> these<00:00:52.550> dangers<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.150> we'll<00:00:53.330> have<00:00:54.290> to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
driving these dangers of we'll have to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.230 
driving these dangers of we'll have to
see<00:00:54.560> those<00:00:54.740> this<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.370> better<00:00:55.610> for<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.060> wheel

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
see those this is better for the wheel

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.900 
see those this is better for the wheel
and<00:00:56.450> that<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.290> little<00:00:57.440> bit<00:00:57.530> better

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910

during the faster we're not fetching
when<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.510> apply<00:01:16.720> your<00:01:16.870> nurses<00:01:17.350> like<00:01:17.470> they're

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
when you apply your nurses like they're

standing<00:01:18.040> still<00:01:18.870> how<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:19.930> gain<00:01:20.290> not<00:01:20.530> as<00:01:20.770> well

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
standing still how you gain not as well

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.320 
standing still how you gain not as well
developed<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.520> should<00:01:21.670> go<00:01:21.790> through<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.090> game

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
developed we should go through the game

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.920 
developed we should go through the game
so<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.470> know<00:01:23.560> growing<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.980> wrong<00:01:24.160> way<00:01:24.930> we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
so you know growing the wrong way we

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.930 
so you know growing the wrong way we
envision<00:01:26.710> offs<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.130> only<00:01:27.340> after<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.700> first

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
envision offs but only after the first

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.840 
envision offs but only after the first
few<00:01:28.120> races<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.650> increase<00:01:29.830> your<00:01:30.280> powers<00:01:30.700> if

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
few races so you increase your powers if

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.090 
few races so you increase your powers if
you<00:01:30.880> go<00:01:31.090> through<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.450> game<00:01:31.660> plays<00:01:32.620> with

you go through the game plays with

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.840 
you go through the game plays with

speed section here is a short cut off to
the<00:01:40.180> side<00:01:40.390> there<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.900> was<00:01:41.200> aware<00:01:41.410> of<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.740> I

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
the side there I was aware of it I

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.440 
the side there I was aware of it I
thought<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.400> myself<00:01:42.430> no<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:45.040> car<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.880> no<00:01:46.210> good

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
thought to myself no my car is no good

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.910 
thought to myself no my car is no good
on<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.690> dirt<00:01:46.870> basically<00:01:47.440> it<00:01:47.530> can't<00:01:47.710> take<00:01:47.890> a

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
on the dirt basically it can't take a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.950 
on the dirt basically it can't take a
corner<00:01:48.220> at<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.580> high<00:01:48.760> speed<00:01:49.060> slow<00:01:49.630> right<00:01:49.930> now

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
corner at that high speed slow right now

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.440 
corner at that high speed slow right now
as<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.830> happened<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.220> went<00:01:51.430> wide<00:01:51.640> anyway<00:01:52.090> but

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
as it happened to went wide anyway but

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.360 
as it happened to went wide anyway but
didn't<00:01:53.020> cost<00:01:53.140> me<00:01:53.290> too<00:01:53.470> much<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.950> still<00:01:54.190> gave

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
didn't cost me too much and still gave

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.670 
didn't cost me too much and still gave
me<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.580> good<00:01:54.700> run<00:01:54.910> on<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.210> section<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.930> as<00:01:56.530> I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
me a good run on this section so as I

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.280 
me a good run on this section so as I
figured<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.550> works<00:01:57.760> out<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.210> your<00:01:58.290> chicken

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
figured it works out in your chicken

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.270 
figured it works out in your chicken
section<00:01:59.860> here<00:02:00.160> oncoming<00:02:00.700> traffic<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:02.280> little

whole hand brake section the hand brake

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.610 
whole hand brake section the hand brake
doesn't<00:02:40.090> work<00:02:40.390> for<00:02:40.600> me<00:02:40.630> at<00:02:40.810> all<00:02:40.959> when<00:02:41.560> I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
doesn't work for me at all when I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.170 
doesn't work for me at all when I
handbrake<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.400> overseas<00:02:42.880> especially

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
handbrake it just overseas especially

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.210 
handbrake it just overseas especially
our<00:02:43.630> basically<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.500> found<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:44.830> much<00:02:44.980> easier

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
our basically so I found it much easier

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.510 
our basically so I found it much easier

God just claimed the backend just

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.380 
God just claimed the backend just
stepped<00:04:26.340> out<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> little<00:04:26.730> bit<00:04:26.910> more<00:04:27.090> than<00:04:27.210> i<00:04:27.270> was

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390

if<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.440> learned<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.740> section<00:05:38.130> 9<00:05:38.310> did<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.580> few

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
if I learned the section 9 did it few

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.220 
if I learned the section 9 did it few
more<00:05:38.880> times<00:05:39.120> obviously<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.780> would<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:40.020> too

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
more times obviously it would be too

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.770 
more times obviously it would be too
difficult<00:05:40.410> you<00:05:40.889> could<00:05:41.330> learn<00:05:42.330> some<00:05:42.660> of<00:05:42.690> the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
difficult you could learn some of the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.390 
difficult you could learn some of the
breaking<00:05:43.020> points<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.680> stuff<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:43.980> go<00:05:44.100> before

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
breaking points and stuff and go before
