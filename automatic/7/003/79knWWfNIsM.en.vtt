00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
you say you have this program there's no

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.479 
you say you have this program there's no
time<00:00:26.689> limitation<00:00:27.380> now<00:00:27.560> Stanley<00:00:27.980> mutations

so<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.500> look<00:00:31.430> more<00:00:31.669> towards<00:00:32.300> what's<00:00:32.629> important

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
so I look more towards what's important

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.009 
so I look more towards what's important
to<00:00:33.260> me<00:00:33.290> music<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:33.949> as<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.970> pianist<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.750> really

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
to me music and as a pianist I really

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.900 
to me music and as a pianist I really
cherish<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.589> fact<00:00:36.830> that<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.339> many<00:00:37.430> composers

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
cherish the fact that so many composers

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.610 
cherish the fact that so many composers
have<00:00:38.269> been<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:38.780> generous<00:00:39.019> with<00:00:39.260> their

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
have been so generous with their

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.710 
have been so generous with their
instrument<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.400> there's<00:00:40.550> music<00:00:40.820> from<00:00:41.390> all

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
history so it's a very long journey in

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.640 
history so it's a very long journey in
three<00:00:48.260> parts<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:50.210> parts<00:00:50.570> are<00:00:50.839> somehow

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
three parts and the parts are somehow

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.280 
three parts and the parts are somehow
connected<00:00:51.799> but<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:52.909> will<00:00:53.540> love<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.019> audience

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
connected but I will love the audience

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.070
