00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
think I was given the looks that they

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.700 
think I was given the looks that they
need<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.109> wasn't<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.529> there

getting my brains knocked out yet is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.840 
getting my brains knocked out yet is
because<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
because you would think they want the
best<00:00:39.149> harder<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> hardest<00:00:40.379> work<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.770> can

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
about being a sparring partner having

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.450 
about being a sparring partner having
that<00:01:25.259> mentality<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.220> ain't
