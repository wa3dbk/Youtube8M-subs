breakouts so a good way to figure this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
breakouts so a good way to figure this
out<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.710> look<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.100> where<00:00:38.309> you're

this<00:04:50.789> and<00:04:51.180> they<00:04:51.750> last<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.319> think<00:04:52.560> one<00:04:52.710> bottle

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
this and they last I think one bottle

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.469 
this and they last I think one bottle
lost<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.340> about<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.550> month<00:04:53.789> so<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.210> takes<00:04:54.389> about

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
lost you about a month so it takes about

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.089 
lost you about a month so it takes about
two<00:04:54.720> months<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:54.990> see<00:04:55.080> results<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.800> they<00:04:55.919> are<00:04:56.069> a

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
two months to see results and they are a

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.980 
two months to see results and they are a
little<00:04:56.460> pricey<00:04:56.789> I<00:04:57.120> think<00:04:57.449> this<00:04:57.569> bottle<00:04:57.870> is

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
little pricey I think this bottle is

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.670 
little pricey I think this bottle is
around<00:04:58.229> fifty<00:04:58.590> dollars<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.199> do<00:05:01.259> really

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
around fifty dollars but I do really

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.490 
around fifty dollars but I do really
think<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:02.130> worth<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:03.259> then<00:05:04.259> I've<00:05:04.380> also

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
think it's worth it and then I've also

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.670 
think it's worth it and then I've also
been<00:05:04.800> taking<00:05:05.280> borage<00:05:06.060> oil<00:05:06.599> it<00:05:07.530> was

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
been taking borage oil it was

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.129 
been taking borage oil it was
recommended<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.250> take<00:05:08.490> this<00:05:08.699> along<00:05:09.330> with

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
recommended to take this along with

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.230 
recommended to take this along with
these<00:05:10.520> apparently<00:05:11.520> this<00:05:11.669> helps<00:05:11.970> with<00:05:12.060> your

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
these apparently this helps with your

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.029 
these apparently this helps with your
skin<00:05:12.479> too<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.169> they've<00:05:13.409> also<00:05:13.590> been<00:05:13.770> taking

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
skin too and they've also been taking

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.189 
skin too and they've also been taking
the<00:05:14.130> b100<00:05:14.729> complex<00:05:15.150> which<00:05:15.719> is<00:05:15.840> pretty<00:05:16.020> much

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
the b100 complex which is pretty much

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.330 
the b100 complex which is pretty much
just<00:05:16.409> a<00:05:16.530> whole<00:05:16.680> bunch<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:17.009> B<00:05:17.190> vitamins

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
just a whole bunch of B vitamins

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.420 
just a whole bunch of B vitamins
altogether<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.479> it<00:05:19.349> says<00:05:19.530> it's<00:05:19.710> for<00:05:19.919> energy

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
altogether and it says it's for energy

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.070 
altogether and it says it's for energy
and<00:05:20.580> anti<00:05:20.969> stress<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.629> I<00:05:21.750> feel<00:05:21.900> like<00:05:21.990> I'm

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
and anti stress and I feel like I'm

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.719 
and anti stress and I feel like I'm
always<00:05:22.259> tired<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.219> gets<00:05:23.340> stressed<00:05:23.580> out

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
always tired and it gets stressed out

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.089 
always tired and it gets stressed out
really<00:05:23.879> easy<00:05:24.120> so<00:05:24.569> just<00:05:25.289> been<00:05:25.469> taking<00:05:25.770> these<00:05:25.919> as

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
really easy so just been taking these as

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.399 
really easy so just been taking these as
well<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.699> I<00:05:27.210> think<00:05:27.659> they've<00:05:27.870> been<00:05:27.900> helping

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
well and I think they've been helping

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.260 
well and I think they've been helping
having<00:05:28.979> taken<00:05:29.280> them<00:05:29.370> for<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.550> long<00:05:29.610> so<00:05:29.759> I

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
having taken them for that long so I

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.200 
having taken them for that long so I
can't<00:05:31.229> really<00:05:31.319> say<00:05:31.560> but<00:05:31.740> B<00:05:32.430> vitamins<00:05:32.909> are<00:05:33.180> good

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
can't really say but B vitamins are good

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.990 
can't really say but B vitamins are good
for<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:33.630> so<00:05:34.050> I've<00:05:34.590> been<00:05:34.740> taking<00:05:35.009> them<00:05:35.159> so<00:05:35.880> yeah
