00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 it is easy to have an approximate notion that 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.839
 a second is anyone can 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.610
 maintain this 60 beat rate per 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.179
 minute easily until with enough 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.950
 precision but often this precision 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.109
 is insufficient to meet research 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.240
 scientists to guide satellites and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.550
 gps and set the times that were 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 subject of a recent video of mine but how 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 define a second several devices already 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 were invented over the centuries 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.429
 to mark the time always a little more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.009
 advanced and modern in their accuracy 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.719
 be it using the sun sand water candles the sky 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.610
 starry and recently watches 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.079
 mechanical or even more complex devices 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.540
 involving electricity that is of 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.640
 quartz the second community had to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 be reset several times until 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.340
 what is he today? 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 for this definition to cease to be 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.059
 arbitrary as a storm that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 we have the second was initially 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 defined with a share of 86 thousand and 400 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.730
 of a day or a part of 60 that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.480
 one minute made 60 of them which form 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.949
 sometimes 24 in a day thereafter the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 was transformed into a fraction of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.229
 year as an attempt to improve 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.229
 however it was clear that the land has 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 variations in their speed of rotation 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.409
 variations that may end up causing a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.820
 loss of up to 0 points in a second is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 total duration 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.680
 so the second had to be based on 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 stable in the long run as the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.100
 vibration of the cesium atoms to be 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 exact 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 This is how the atomic clocks that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.869
 based on the billions of times that an atom 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 vibrates per second to set the time 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.290
 while a normal wristwatch to the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.509
 quartz base and traced forward in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.430
 about 15 seconds per month 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.200
 the ordinary atomic clock would take longer 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.689
 of a million years to lose or 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.970
 earn a single second and even those 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.560
 small imperfections are corrected with 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 based on data from hundreds of other 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 machines around the world 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.560
 connected via satellite 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270
 hydrogen and IDB are also used 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.180
 to mark the time in watches a little 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.390
 more still and accessible but inaccurate 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.340
 the current definition of the 2nd since 1967 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.990
 finally said that a second equals 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.689
 the duration of 9 billion 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.700
 192 million six hundred and thirty one thousand 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.530
 seven hundred and seventy 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 radiation corresponding to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.890
 two superfine levels of the state 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.950
 of the atom of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.750
 is 133 to simplify the general idea 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.910
 behind it is that like all 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 elements emit energy quickly and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.330
 regular intervals 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.209
 this frequency can be used as a 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.950
 instrument to measure the time interval 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.140
 the time required for them to be 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.090
 occurs about 9 billion times in the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.190
 cesium atom is equivalent then there 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 precisely a second 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.989
 this setting is optimal because it 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.830
 allows any scientist 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.470
 regardless of where he or she 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.320
 is in the world a universe can 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.660
 calculate the second with accuracy and 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.530
 what the second is explained up to now 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.530
 in three-minute video
