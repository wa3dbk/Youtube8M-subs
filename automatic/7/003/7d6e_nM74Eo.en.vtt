00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
first because that's always going to be

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.940

your<00:01:15.299> heaviest<00:01:15.570> ingredient<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.650> not

your heaviest ingredient or if not

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.929 
your heaviest ingredient or if not
always<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.689> good<00:01:18.689> portion<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.939> then

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
always a good portion of the time then

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.420 
always a good portion of the time then
we're<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.720> lemon<00:01:22.409> juice<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.450> was

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
we're going to put lemon juice and I was

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.260 
we're going to put lemon juice and I was
interested<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> find<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> actually

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
interested to find that this actually

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.260 
interested to find that this actually
does<00:01:27.689> layer<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.320> yes<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.130> did<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:30.030> bit

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
does layer and yes I I did a little bit

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.819 
does layer and yes I I did a little bit
of<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.420> ahead<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.750> time<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.439> wanted

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
of this ahead of time because I wanted

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
of this ahead of time because I wanted
to<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.130> sure<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.340> had<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> chance<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.299> layer<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
to make sure I had a chance to layer it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.319 
to make sure I had a chance to layer it
and<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.829> work<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.060> foggy

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and have it work it's a little foggy

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
and have it work it's a little foggy
because<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> juice<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.100> works<00:01:44.430> at

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
because it is a juice but it works at

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
because it is a juice but it works at
layers<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.149> top<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.450> grenadine<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.590> blends

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
layers on top of grenadine it blends

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.389 
layers on top of grenadine it blends
just<00:01:47.880> ever<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.479> slightly<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:50.130> trick

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
just ever so slightly and then the trick

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
just ever so slightly and then the trick
is<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.240> even<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> trach<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> was

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is I would not even a trach it was

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
is I would not even a trach it was
something<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.320> didn't<00:01:52.500> understand<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.790> could

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
something I didn't understand it could

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
something I didn't understand it could
be<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> lot<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> things<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.259> vodka<00:01:55.950> actually

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
be a lot of things but vodka actually

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.469 
be a lot of things but vodka actually
can<00:01:56.880> float<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.390> top<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:58.610> lime<00:01:59.610> juice<00:01:59.640> or<00:02:00.149> lemon

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
can float on top of lime juice or lemon

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.020 
can float on top of lime juice or lemon
juice<00:02:00.630> man<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.320> horrible<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:05.030> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
juice man I'm horrible with that so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.540 
juice man I'm horrible with that so
throw<00:02:06.509> our<00:02:06.659> vodka<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.229> here

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.350 

but<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.880> not<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.210> perfectly<00:02:13.960> clear<00:02:14.350> layering

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
but it's not a perfectly clear layering

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.510 
but it's not a perfectly clear layering
for<00:02:16.360> two<00:02:16.480> reasons<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.020> glass<00:02:17.350> is<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.650> pain<00:02:18.430> in

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
for two reasons this glass is a pain in

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.700 
for two reasons this glass is a pain in
the<00:02:18.550> neck<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.630> was<00:02:19.720> big<00:02:20.200> enough<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.560> hold

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
the neck but it was big enough to hold

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.910 
the neck but it was big enough to hold
the<00:02:20.860> layers<00:02:21.130> i<00:02:21.370> wanted<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the layers i wanted and just the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.730 
the layers i wanted and just the
ingredients<00:02:24.430> aren't<00:02:24.910> really<00:02:25.360> meant<00:02:25.740> they're

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
ingredients aren't really meant they're

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.680 
ingredients aren't really meant they're
not<00:02:26.860> really<00:02:27.220> they're<00:02:27.850> their<00:02:28.150> own<00:02:28.180> they're

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
not really they're their own they're

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.250 
not really they're their own they're
almost<00:02:28.960> close<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.740> same<00:02:29.920> weight<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:32.230> they

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
almost close to the same weight so they

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.750 
almost close to the same weight so they
kind<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.680> lend<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.040> little<00:02:33.370> bit<00:02:37.710> what<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
kind of lend a little bit what the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.680 
kind of lend a little bit what the
effect<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.300> still<00:02:40.570> pretty<00:02:40.810> friggin<00:02:41.770> cool<00:02:42.690> so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
effect is still pretty friggin cool so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.110 
effect is still pretty friggin cool so
before<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.440> last<00:02:44.770> step<00:02:45.160> I'll<00:02:45.430> let<00:02:45.910> you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
before I do the last step I'll let you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.370 
before I do the last step I'll let you
see<00:02:46.360> what<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.600> looks<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:46.960> right<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
see what it looks like right there so

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.740 
see what it looks like right there so
the<00:02:51.100> absent<00:02:51.700> layer<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.030> best<00:02:52.330> probably

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
the absent layer is the best probably

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.500 
the absent layer is the best probably
because<00:02:52.990> it's<00:02:53.140> got<00:02:53.290> such<00:02:53.560> intense<00:02:53.920> alcohol

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
because it's got such intense alcohol

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.830 
because it's got such intense alcohol
the<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:56.350> almost<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.830> polar<00:02:57.130> opposite<00:02:57.820> of<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
the it's almost a polar opposite of the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.410 
the it's almost a polar opposite of the
grenadine<00:02:59.670> we<00:03:00.670> good<00:03:00.880> oh<00:03:01.860> yeah<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.250> no<00:03:03.460> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
grenadine we good oh yeah and no the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.630 
grenadine we good oh yeah and no the
vodka<00:03:04.780> sits<00:03:04.990> in<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.170> middle<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.280> reason

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
vodka sits in the middle and the reason

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.280 
vodka sits in the middle and the reason
this<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.790> really<00:03:07.090> stupid<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.810> absent

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
this is really stupid it's just absent

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.180 
this is really stupid it's just absent
this<00:03:08.380> very<00:03:08.830> potent<00:03:10.500> there's<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.590> lot<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.860> drink

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
this very potent there's a lot of drink

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.570 
this very potent there's a lot of drink
here<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.120> definitely<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:17.140> fire<00:03:17.580> it's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
here and it is definitely on fire it's

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.580 
here and it is definitely on fire it's
probably<00:03:18.730> hard<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.120> tell<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.960> will<00:03:20.440> probably

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
probably hard to tell and will probably

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.200 
probably hard to tell and will probably
stay<00:03:20.890> lit<00:03:21.550> for<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.850> while<00:03:22.200> see<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> blurriness

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
stay lit for a while see the blurriness

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.370 
stay lit for a while see the blurriness
very<00:03:25.210> hot<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:28.780> hard<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.960> blow<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.290> out

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
very hot it's hard to blow it out

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.980 
very hot it's hard to blow it out
because<00:03:29.560> absinthe<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.950> potent<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.990> you

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
because absinthe is so so potent and you

what we've taught you today is that this

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
is really crazy and that was probably

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.890 
is really crazy and that was probably
the<00:06:35.340> first<00:06:35.400> shot<00:06:36.030> i<00:06:36.240> haven't<00:06:36.540> been<00:06:36.570> able<00:06:36.690> to

the first shot i haven't been able to
actually<00:06:37.610> physically<00:06:38.610> finish<00:06:39.120> because<00:06:39.240> i<00:06:39.420> get

a<00:06:39.930> cup<00:06:40.110> is<00:06:40.260> hard<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:40.950> that's<00:06:41.880> kind<00:06:42.180> of<00:06:42.680> that's

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
a cup is hard the that's kind of that's

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.990 
a cup is hard the that's kind of that's
kind<00:06:43.950> of<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.130> biggest<00:06:44.430> problem<00:06:44.550> I<00:06:44.790> think<00:06:44.820> with

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
kind of the biggest problem I think with

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.390 
kind of the biggest problem I think with
this<00:06:45.180> is<00:06:45.420> because<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.050> mouth<00:06:46.260> is<00:06:46.470> so<00:06:46.620> wide<00:06:46.830> it

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
this is because the mouth is so wide it

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.430 
this is because the mouth is so wide it
like<00:06:47.670> wants<00:06:48.150> you<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.330> roll<00:06:48.870> out<00:06:49.080> of<00:06:49.230> your<00:06:49.320> mouth

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
like wants you to roll out of your mouth

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.080 
like wants you to roll out of your mouth
so<00:06:49.620> you<00:06:49.650> have<00:06:50.040> to<00:06:50.130> kind<00:06:50.250> of<00:06:50.340> slow<00:06:50.640> down<00:06:50.670> and

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
so you have to kind of slow down and

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.970 
so you have to kind of slow down and
when<00:06:51.180> you<00:06:51.240> slow<00:06:51.450> down<00:06:51.630> boom<00:06:52.350> you<00:06:52.740> get<00:06:52.860> this

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
when you slow down boom you get this

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.340 
when you slow down boom you get this
huge<00:06:53.250> fire<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:53.820> sour<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:54.360> it<00:06:54.840> really

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
huge fire and sour and it really

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.040 
huge fire and sour and it really
