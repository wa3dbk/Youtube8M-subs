was a noticeable difference it turns a

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.260 
was a noticeable difference it turns a
team<00:00:04.319> work<00:00:04.589> or<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.980> way<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.819> two

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
team work or the way that the two

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.549 
team work or the way that the two
companies<00:00:06.810> teams<00:00:07.470> work<00:00:07.980> together<00:00:09.260> we<00:00:10.260> felt

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
companies teams work together we felt

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.030 
companies teams work together we felt
that<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> companies<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.990> teams<00:00:13.320> just

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
that one of the companies the teams just

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.340 
that one of the companies the teams just
didn't<00:00:14.820> quite<00:00:15.000> click<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.870> well<00:00:16.880> perhaps

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
didn't quite click as as well perhaps

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.370 
didn't quite click as as well perhaps
this<00:00:19.350> caused<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.100> second<00:00:20.609> problem<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this caused the second problem the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.920 
this caused the second problem the
second<00:00:22.830> problem<00:00:23.039> may<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.210> been<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.480> fact

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
second problem may have been the fact

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109 
second problem may have been the fact
that<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.410> wasn't<00:00:25.619> enough<00:00:26.099> emphasis<00:00:26.820> or

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that there wasn't enough emphasis or

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.330 
that there wasn't enough emphasis or
there<00:00:27.269> certain<00:00:27.599> emotions<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.199> not<00:00:28.410> done<00:00:28.890> in

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
there certain emotions are not done in

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.900 
there certain emotions are not done in
terms<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.449> total<00:00:31.289> system<00:00:32.189> testing<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:34.910> think

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
terms of total system testing I think

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.420 
terms of total system testing I think
maybe<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.200> slight<00:00:38.989> let's<00:00:39.989> say<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:41.129> just

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
maybe the slight let's say it just

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.540 
maybe the slight let's say it just
wasn't<00:00:42.420> quite<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.750> strong<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> team<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.770> total

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
wasn't quite as strong a team a total

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
wasn't quite as strong a team a total
team<00:00:44.809> maybe<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.289> caused<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> second

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
team maybe that's what caused the second

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
team maybe that's what caused the second
thing<00:00:47.489> i'm<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.789> sure<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:50.000> also<00:00:51.469> have<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
thing i'm not sure but i also have a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.330 
thing i'm not sure but i also have a
suspicion<00:00:53.570> because<00:00:54.570> i<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
suspicion because i was with you in the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.810 
suspicion because i was with you in the
last<00:00:56.520> moments<00:00:56.850> last<00:00:57.690> night<00:00:58.309> I'm<00:00:59.309> telling<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
last moments last night I'm telling to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.410 
last moments last night I'm telling to
have<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> suspicion<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:01.309> when<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.550> try<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
have a suspicion that when you try to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.859 
have a suspicion that when you try to
push<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> envelope<00:01:04.439> too<00:01:05.430> close<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.420> event

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
push the envelope too close to an event

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
push the envelope too close to an event
an<00:01:07.799> event<00:01:07.950> would<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.430> something<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.060> demo

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
an event would be something like a demo

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
an event would be something like a demo
or<00:01:09.960> something<00:01:10.560> where<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.740> bring<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
or something where you have to bring a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.550 
or something where you have to bring a
bunch<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> factors<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> can't<00:01:15.299> control

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
bunch of factors that you can't control

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
bunch of factors that you can't control
you<00:01:16.560> knew<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.159> demo<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.759> couldn't

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you knew that this demo you couldn't

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
you knew that this demo you couldn't
control<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.990> terms<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:19.650> equipment

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
control it in terms of what equipment

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.090 
control it in terms of what equipment
you<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
you are going to be a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.499 
you are going to be a
I<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.140> push<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.250> envelope<00:01:24.400> where<00:01:24.880> where

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
I so so to push the envelope where where

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.080 
I so so to push the envelope where where
you<00:01:25.689> you're<00:01:26.140> putting<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.560> lot<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:27.090> last-minute

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
you you're putting a lot of last-minute

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.950 
you you're putting a lot of last-minute
work<00:01:28.960> or<00:01:29.229> our<00:01:29.860> last<00:01:30.159> minute<00:01:30.430> adjustments<00:01:30.960> when

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
work or our last minute adjustments when

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.930 
work or our last minute adjustments when
you<00:01:32.080> push<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.500> too<00:01:32.740> close<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.369> that<00:01:33.549> kind<00:01:33.580> of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
you push it too close to that kind of

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.590 
you push it too close to that kind of
uncontrolled<00:01:34.570> situation<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:36.759> it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
uncontrolled situation actually it's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.899 
uncontrolled situation actually it's
like<00:01:37.810> holding<00:01:38.259> up<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.590> red<00:01:38.770> flag<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.549> devil

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
like holding up a red flag to the devil

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
like holding up a red flag to the devil
and<00:01:40.060> saying<00:01:40.360> screw<00:01:40.780> me<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.610> thing<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.210> that

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and saying screw me the thing is is that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.210 
and saying screw me the thing is is that
in<00:01:45.009> real<00:01:45.310> life<00:01:45.340> things<00:01:45.850> are<00:01:46.090> going<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.390> happen

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in real life things are going to happen

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.039 
in real life things are going to happen
it<00:01:48.220> bad<00:01:48.520> enough<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:49.180> you<00:01:49.330> can<00:01:49.479> control<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
it bad enough that you can control the

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.960 
it bad enough that you can control the
situation<00:01:50.259> like<00:01:50.710> princes<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.220> can<00:01:51.430> try<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
situation like princes I can try and

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.520 
situation like princes I can try and
control<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.390> time<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.930> we're<00:01:53.319> already

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
control the time in it we're already

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.279 
control the time in it we're already
almost<00:01:53.890> an<00:01:54.429> hour<00:01:54.550> late<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.810> thing<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.140> is

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
almost an hour late so the thing is is

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.260 
almost an hour late so the thing is is
that<00:01:56.640> imagine<00:01:57.640> where<00:01:57.789> it's<00:01:57.880> totally

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
that imagine where it's totally

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.230 
that imagine where it's totally
uncontrolled<00:01:58.840> for<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
uncontrolled for you so so that the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.770 
uncontrolled for you so so that the
mistake<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.200> think<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.190> believe<00:02:03.670> here<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.179> that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
mistake I think I believe here is that

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.050 
mistake I think I believe here is that
you've<00:02:05.020> got<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.380> try<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.190> separate<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:09.060> time

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
you've got to try and separate the time

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.340 
you've got to try and separate the time
of<00:02:10.239> your<00:02:10.360> project<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.959> you're<00:02:11.080> doing

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
of your project that you're doing

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.539 
of your project that you're doing
changes<00:02:12.010> try<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.700> make<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.090> really<00:02:13.600> big<00:02:13.900> buffer

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
changes try and make a really big buffer

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.120 
changes try and make a really big buffer
between<00:02:15.549> that<00:02:16.090> time<00:02:16.450> where<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.780> ends<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
between that time where it ends and the

between that time where it ends and the

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
time where that uncontrolled situation

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.690 
time where that uncontrolled situation
the<00:02:20.980> demo<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.900> product<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.310> usability<00:02:24.310> test

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
the demo the product of usability test

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.880 
the demo the product of usability test
would<00:02:24.850> never<00:02:25.000> make<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.450> nigga<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:26.200> big<00:02:26.470> buffer

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
would never make it nigga a big buffer

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.090 
would never make it nigga a big buffer
you<00:02:27.579> should<00:02:27.820> have<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:29.650> been<00:02:29.709> working

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
you should have really not been working

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.160 
you should have really not been working
so<00:02:30.489> hard<00:02:30.519> last<00:02:30.910> night<00:02:31.269> on<00:02:31.510> changes<00:02:32.019> or

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so hard last night on changes or

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.050 
so hard last night on changes or
adjustments<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:33.310> should<00:02:33.489> have<00:02:33.610> actually<00:02:33.910> had

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
adjustments we should have actually had

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.120 
adjustments we should have actually had
that<00:02:34.239> done<00:02:34.510> perhaps<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.590> couple<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.950> days

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
that done perhaps a couple of days

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.240 
that done perhaps a couple of days
before<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.000> gives<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.299> enough<00:02:37.390> time<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
before and that gives you enough time to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.599 
before and that gives you enough time to
do<00:02:39.250> then<00:02:39.430> go<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.239> days<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.709> system<00:02:42.190> testing

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
do then go and do days of system testing

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.210 
do then go and do days of system testing
or<00:02:42.760> four<00:02:42.910> days<00:02:43.329> of<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.840> basically<00:02:44.380> trying<00:02:45.070> to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
or four days of just basically trying to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.070 
or four days of just basically trying to
destroy

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
destroy

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.260 
destroy
see<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:46.740> what<00:02:47.130> ticks<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.550> what<00:02:47.670> doesn't<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
see what what ticks and what doesn't it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.000 
see what what ticks and what doesn't it
so<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:51.110> believe<00:02:52.110> you're<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.440> pretty<00:02:52.770> good

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
so I believe you're all pretty good

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.160 
so I believe you're all pretty good
peers<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.240> really<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.930> probably

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
peers and I think really you probably

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.680 
peers and I think really you probably
only<00:02:55.650> liked<00:02:56.610> each<00:02:56.820> other<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.360> work<00:02:57.510> together

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
only liked each other and work together

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.400 
only liked each other and work together
but<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.740> think<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.250> somehow<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.900> one<00:03:01.170> team

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
but but I think that somehow on one team

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.070 
but but I think that somehow on one team
the<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.430> clicking<00:03:03.150> wasn't<00:03:03.540> quite<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:03.930> as

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the the clicking wasn't quite there as

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.140 
the the clicking wasn't quite there as
much<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> other<00:03:04.710> team<00:03:04.980> secondly<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
much as the other team secondly the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150 
much as the other team secondly the
system<00:03:06.690> testing<00:03:07.080> obviously<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:07.980> my

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
system testing obviously it was my

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.830 
system testing obviously it was my
extent<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.490> got<00:03:08.760> more<00:03:08.970> testing<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.630> and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
extent that got more testing that and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
extent that got more testing that and
they<00:03:10.020> were<00:03:10.080> able<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:12.350> basically<00:03:13.350> survive

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
they were able to to basically survive

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.160 
they were able to to basically survive
the<00:03:14.130> uncontrolled<00:03:14.640> instance<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.330> third<00:03:15.960> me

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
the uncontrolled instance and third me

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.090 
the uncontrolled instance and third me
in<00:03:16.380> general<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:17.640> think<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.650> when<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.770> push<00:03:19.950> it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
in general I think that when you push it

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
in general I think that when you push it
too<00:03:20.220> close<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> event<00:03:21.060> you're<00:03:21.600> just

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
too close to the event you're just

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.840 
too close to the event you're just
asking<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.140> trouble<00:03:22.290> now<00:03:23.220> one<00:03:23.490> last<00:03:23.730> thing

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
asking for trouble now one last thing

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.380 
asking for trouble now one last thing
with<00:03:24.120> respective<00:03:24.690> priorities<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:26.209> gave<00:03:27.209> you

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
with respective priorities I gave you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.800 
with respective priorities I gave you
the<00:03:27.510> requirements<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:29.570> pick<00:03:30.570> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the requirements and you pick the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.220 
the requirements and you pick the
priorities<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.560> did<00:03:32.430> give<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.730> guidelines<00:03:33.230> but

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
priorities I did give you guidelines but

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.110 
priorities I did give you guidelines but
you<00:03:34.470> pick<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.860> priorities<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.840> think<00:03:37.170> maybe

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
you pick the priorities so I think maybe

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.510 
you pick the priorities so I think maybe
one<00:03:39.120> team<00:03:39.530> perhaps<00:03:40.970> didn't<00:03:41.970> put<00:03:42.890> an<00:03:43.890> emphasis

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
one team perhaps didn't put an emphasis

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.120 
one team perhaps didn't put an emphasis
on<00:03:45.440> what<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.490> think<00:03:47.490> were<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.330> more<00:03:49.320> important

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
on what I think were the more important

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.630 
on what I think were the more important
priorities<00:03:51.560> actually<00:03:53.209> there's<00:03:54.209> a

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
priorities actually there's a

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.309 
priorities actually there's a
it's<00:03:54.910> really<00:03:55.150> nice<00:03:55.270> that<00:03:55.330> bells<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.960> whistles

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
it's really nice that bells and whistles

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.170 
it's really nice that bells and whistles
and<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.590> really<00:03:56.860> nice<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.040> have<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.460> great

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and it's really nice to have a great

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.930 
and it's really nice to have a great
display<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:59.050> that<00:03:59.890> type<00:04:00.100> of<00:04:00.130> stuff<00:04:00.280> but<00:04:00.610> if<00:04:00.790> it

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
display and that type of stuff but if it

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.270 
display and that type of stuff but if it
doesn't<00:04:01.300> work<00:04:01.450> at<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.140> very<00:04:02.350> core<00:04:02.410> if<00:04:03.069> the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
doesn't work at the very core if the

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.370 
doesn't work at the very core if the
engine<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.760> working<00:04:04.569> properly<00:04:04.810> it's<00:04:05.260> not

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
engine is working properly it's not

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.740 
engine is working properly it's not
robust<00:04:05.830> then<00:04:06.700> maybe<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.090> doesn't<00:04:07.240> matter<00:04:07.569> how

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
robust then maybe it doesn't matter how

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.990 
robust then maybe it doesn't matter how
good<00:04:07.959> everything<00:04:08.260> else<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.880> generally<00:04:09.880> it

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
good everything else is generally it

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.250 
good everything else is generally it
takes<00:04:10.830> everyone<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:12.640> remember<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.720> when<00:04:14.110> you

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
takes everyone so remember that when you

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.319 
takes everyone so remember that when you
pick<00:04:14.500> your<00:04:14.650> priorities<00:04:15.310> especially<00:04:16.000> for<00:04:16.239> an

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
pick your priorities especially for an

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.590 
pick your priorities especially for an
iterative<00:04:16.810> project<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:18.519> must<00:04:18.820> pick<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.150> core

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
iterative project you must pick a core

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.340 
iterative project you must pick a core
that<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.200> achieve<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:22.350> achievement

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
that you can achieve and achievement

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.710 
that you can achieve and achievement
beams<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:24.010> got<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.430> survive<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.240> demo<00:04:25.510> we

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
beams is got to survive the demo we

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.440 
beams is got to survive the demo we
can't<00:04:26.020> be<00:04:26.560> good<00:04:26.890> only<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.000> devil<00:04:28.210> is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
can't be good only if the devil is

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.990 
can't be good only if the devil is
perfect<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.380> got<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.680> survive<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.370> yes<00:04:30.610> so

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
perfect it's got to survive that yes so

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.450 
perfect it's got to survive that yes so
so<00:04:31.630> when<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.380> choose<00:04:32.650> your<00:04:32.830> parties<00:04:33.220> make

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
so when you choose your parties make

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.630 
so when you choose your parties make
sure<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.730> really<00:04:34.240> choose<00:04:34.570> them<00:04:34.930> well<00:04:35.640> the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
sure you really choose them well the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.000 
sure you really choose them well the
ones<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:37.030> really<00:04:37.450> count<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.260> when<00:04:38.860> you

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
ones that really count that when you
