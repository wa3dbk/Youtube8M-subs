00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.710
 and we are going to regulate the 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.919
 floats of a carburetor of a 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.830
 kawasaki turn z400 I am this video comes out 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.299
 a bit like I 'm sorry but with a 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.059
 hand is half complicated to do this 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.760
 work and with the other sign the first 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.060
 that we have to take into account that the 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.400
 carburetor flotation level 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.260
 of these bikes 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.880
 this region over a measure 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.220
 standard that comes from factory 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.220
 that measure is from this point 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.589
 where am I dialing with this cartonero 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.680
 at the level of guerrilla voting 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:48.109
 has that in 317 millimeters or so 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.199
 17 18 16 is the standard to be able to leave 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.829
 well regulated the flowering of the crude 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.829
 for that we should not 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.150
 put a precision tool that 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.980
 in this case it would be 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.220
 metro is prevented which at this time 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.470
 is degrees 17 that we will use as support 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 to be able to level these 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.600
 carburetors 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 first we have to see how is the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.210
 leveling of the forums in this case 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.250
 we passed the perimeter and scary 17 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.570
 millimeters 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.080
 and see 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.880
 at what level is the flotation 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.760
 at this moment it is a bit high but 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.360
 that age is minimal if we look through 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.020
 example the lake float 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.030
 this is very high then you have to 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.160
 lower that flotation and leave the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.380
 miners buildings like all the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.680
 other floats are also very high 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.270
 this for example is almost in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.880
 regulation if you realize 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.549
 from the foot of the subway there is no 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 problem when going through the operation I'm 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.729
 it is essential for the vats 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.120
 do not overdo it when you enter the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.440
 boot calculation look at this is very 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 compliment 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.180
 how is the flotation of these 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.629
 loaders 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.629
 the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.880
 the float itself has a little can 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.690
 guerrilla if you will find out if 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.380
 you look at it well it is not latin in 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.570
 carburetor 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.640
 the diet here is us what we do 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.010
 we had a low or for example 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.810
 now I'm going to upload it excuse the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.150
 movement of the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.310
 rope to raise it with one hand is done 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.680
 half complicated 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.490
 so how high is it, what is it 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.750
 I'm going to go up a little 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.750
 I will not go up a bit 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.220
 after regulating the height of these 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.300
 players but be how alive I was 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.640
 very very high 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.520
 we had better 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.459
 or whether it is still very high the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.360
 bloom so let's fix it from 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.890
 new 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.010
 excuse the affirmation of returning me 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.650
 it is already complicated to do it with one hand 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.900
 right now I'm there 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.120
 I will not take the camera trying to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.760
 go up a bit more this tin can do it 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.799
 Carefully with patience in some 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.349
 moment is going to regulate we are seeing 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.860
 let's see this is a very, very, very 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.480
 delicate for example now 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.870
 it was very low 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.430
 they realize and we have a light 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.450
 very very low he 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.600
 we float a hundred 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.440
 a super environment 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.350
 the recent inverse 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.640
 is showing a life up and 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.710
 now we have to push it down 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.500
 push us in this life down 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.500
 to be able to adjust the height 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.459
 now even perfect 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.209
 the float go up and down and I 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.700
 hit against him 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.639
 against the foot of the subway 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.530
 that is the regulation of the floats 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.139
 for those who want to do it in 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.680
 their houses just have a little bit of 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.400
 patience and they will achieve it in the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.009
 next video I'm going to teach you 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.779
 regulate the romantic stake screw 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.550
 because now I'm going to finish regular 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:44.219
 this for now and then I'm going to 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.749
 teach how to verify if floating 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.749
 that I heard perfect conditions'
