00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
probably if it's a really good card I'm

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.960 
probably if it's a really good card I'm
probably<00:02:38.930> get<00:02:39.260> two<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.470> them<00:02:39.709> maybe<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.700> know<00:02:40.820> I

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
probably get two of them maybe I know I

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.490 
probably get two of them maybe I know I
said<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.240> wanted<00:02:41.480> what<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.780> want<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.050> do<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:42.320> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
said I wanted what I want to do that's a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.340 
said I wanted what I want to do that's a
lie<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:42.950> we'll<00:02:43.010> see<00:02:43.570> but<00:02:44.570> more<00:02:44.870> likely<00:02:45.110> i'm

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
lie but we'll see but more likely i'm

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.290 
lie but we'll see but more likely i'm
just<00:02:45.530> gonna<00:02:45.650> stick<00:02:45.920> with<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.030> then

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
just gonna stick with this one and then

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.280 
just gonna stick with this one and then
once<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.930> if<00:02:48.470> there<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> TI<00:02:49.580> version<00:02:50.300> maybe

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
once the if there is a TI version maybe

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.310 
once the if there is a TI version maybe
I'll<00:02:51.640> go<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.330> don't<00:02:53.570> know<00:02:53.720> we'll

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
I'll go with that I don't know we'll

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.940 
I'll go with that I don't know we'll
know<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> next<00:02:54.830> few<00:02:55.100> months<00:02:56.020> but<00:02:57.020> yeah

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
know in the next few months but yeah

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.560 
know in the next few months but yeah
math<00:02:58.160> for<00:02:58.370> anybody<00:02:58.670> else<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.940> saw<00:02:59.120> my<00:02:59.300> rent

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
math for anybody else that saw my rent

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.810 
math for anybody else that saw my rent
video<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.130> went<00:03:01.340> ahead<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.580> did<00:03:01.760> it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
video and I just went ahead and did it

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.000 
video and I just went ahead and did it
so<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.450> probably<00:03:03.290> won't<00:03:03.470> be<00:03:03.650> able<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.830> make<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
so I probably won't be able to make the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.449 
so I probably won't be able to make the
video<00:03:04.310> today<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.720> tomorrow<00:03:06.040> I'm<00:03:07.040> going<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.370> be
