the<00:00:45.809> four<00:00:46.020> batteries<00:00:46.289> doublea's<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the four batteries doublea's can be

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
the four batteries doublea's can be
charged<00:00:48.000> by<00:00:48.149> USB<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.010> that's<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> key<00:00:50.340> now

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
charged by USB and that's the key now

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.060 
charged by USB and that's the key now
with<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:50.910> lights<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.360> USB<00:00:51.600> charging

with all these lights it's USB charging

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.229 
with all these lights it's USB charging
and<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.280> reason<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> look

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and the reason is you don't have to look

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.840 
and the reason is you don't have to look
for<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.570> charger<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> light<00:00:55.770> any<00:00:56.370> USB

seen and then I'm not sure if you can
see<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.549> normally<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> look<00:01:23.880> into

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
see this but normally when you look into

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
see this but normally when you look into
a<00:01:24.090> flashlight<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.659> any<00:01:24.930> bike<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> can

see the the bulbs or the LEDs over here
you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.360> seeing<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.720> reflectors

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you can all you're seeing is reflectors

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
you can all you're seeing is reflectors
and<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:32.310> Phillips<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.729> doing<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.570> they're

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and what Phillips is doing is they're

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.540 
and what Phillips is doing is they're
not<00:01:33.990> letting<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.409> light<00:01:34.619> shine<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.159> directly

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
not letting the light shine out directly

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.740 
not letting the light shine out directly
into<00:01:36.649> into<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.740> road<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> trail<00:01:38.750> they're

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
into into the road or the trail they're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.389 
into into the road or the trail they're
letting<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> shine<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> reflectors<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
letting it shine on the reflectors and

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.460 
letting it shine on the reflectors and
they<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.240> sure<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> only<00:01:43.140> thing<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
they make sure that the only thing you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.499 
they make sure that the only thing you
see<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> reflection<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.580> light<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> why

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
see is a reflection of the light and why

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
see is a reflection of the light and why
that's<00:01:45.659> important<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.710> control<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that's important is they can control the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.770 
that's important is they can control the
beam<00:01:47.550> pattern<00:01:49.850> normally<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:50.970> bike<00:01:51.210> light<00:01:51.450> or

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
beam pattern normally on a bike light or

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.130 
beam pattern normally on a bike light or
a<00:01:52.110> flashlight<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:54.179> beam<00:01:54.420> pattern<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.840> round

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
a flashlight the beam pattern is round

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.710 
a flashlight the beam pattern is round
and<00:01:55.759> light<00:01:56.759> when<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.060> doesn't<00:01:57.360> hit<00:01:57.509> anything

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
and light when it doesn't hit anything

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.499 
and light when it doesn't hit anything
is<00:01:57.929> gone<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.340> bunch<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.789> is<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.030> wasted

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
is gone so a bunch of it is just wasted

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
is gone so a bunch of it is just wasted
you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> upper<00:02:01.860> half<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.789> other

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you know the upper half the other

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.529 
you know the upper half the other
problem<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.550> drivers<00:02:06.030> your

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
problem of that is with drivers your

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.300 
problem of that is with drivers your

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.840 
light on on the on the ground so you can
see<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.259> road<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:11.130> half<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.370> light<00:02:11.670> is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
see the road but half the light is

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.809 
see the road but half the light is
shining<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.269> driver's<00:02:12.600> eyes<00:02:12.750> or<00:02:13.819> thirty

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
shining on the driver's eyes or thirty

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.670 
shining on the driver's eyes or thirty
percent<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.330> light<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.050> Phillip<00:02:16.350> tries<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
percent of the light so Phillip tries to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.170 
percent of the light so Phillip tries to
solve<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.980> by<00:02:17.040> cutting<00:02:17.430> off<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> light<00:02:17.970> up

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
solve that by cutting off the light up

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.050 
solve that by cutting off the light up
top<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.260> let<00:02:19.380> me<00:02:19.440> show<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.650> let<00:02:19.829> me<00:02:19.890> turn<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> on

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.759 

so<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.420> when<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> shot<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.350> priceline

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
so there it is when a shot on priceline

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.460 
so there it is when a shot on priceline
is<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.130> tree<00:02:26.400> over<00:02:26.610> here

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.220 

and<00:02:31.460> what<00:02:31.700> what's<00:02:32.420> really<00:02:32.660> unique<00:02:32.690> about<00:02:32.960> this

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
and what what's really unique about this

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.430 
and what what's really unique about this
light<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.490> just<00:02:34.670> flat<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:36.110> we've<00:02:36.230> proven

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
light this is just flat and we've proven

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.100 
light this is just flat and we've proven
it<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.740> all<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:37.070> our<00:02:37.160> beam<00:02:37.370> pattern<00:02:37.670> charts

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it and all in our beam pattern charts

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.960 
it and all in our beam pattern charts
once<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.290> cut<00:02:39.410> off<00:02:39.520> there's<00:02:40.520> virtually<00:02:40.940> zero

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
once it's cut off there's virtually zero

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.420 
once it's cut off there's virtually zero
light<00:02:41.360> above<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.960> can<00:02:42.110> aim<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.430> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
light above it so you can aim it you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.370 
light above it so you can aim it you
know<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.700> my<00:02:43.880> neck<00:02:44.120> here<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.660> I'm<00:02:45.050> not<00:02:45.080> see

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
know on my neck here and I'm not see

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.570 
know on my neck here and I'm not see
it's<00:02:45.590> not<00:02:45.740> hurting<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.100> eyes<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:48.490> that's<00:02:49.490> the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
it's not hurting my eyes so that's the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.040 
it's not hurting my eyes so that's the
advantage<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.390> know<00:02:50.450> they're<00:02:50.660> putting<00:02:50.960> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
advantage you know they're putting the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.710 
advantage you know they're putting the
light<00:02:51.730> right<00:02:52.730> where<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.030> need<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.240> just

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
light right where you need it just

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.300 
light right where you need it just
aiming<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.230> right<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.650> road<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.040> not<00:02:55.190> on

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
aiming it right on the road and not on

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.740 
aiming it right on the road and not on
driver's<00:02:55.640> eyes<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.530> there<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:58.840> the<00:03:01.750> couple

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
driver's eyes so there it is the couple

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.490

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
it's double a batteries the big

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.050 
it's double a batteries the big
advantage<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.400> he<00:04:43.520> kidding<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.970> are

not

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360 
not
batteries<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:45.710> could<00:04:45.889> just<00:04:45.919> go<00:04:46.159> to<00:04:46.189> the<00:04:46.340> store

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
batteries you could just go to the store

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.839 
batteries you could just go to the store
and<00:04:46.580> replace<00:04:47.240> these<00:04:47.449> but<00:04:48.520> in<00:04:49.520> this<00:04:49.639> day<00:04:49.699> and

and replace these but in this day and
age<00:04:50.030> that's<00:04:50.870> actually<00:04:51.020> pretty<00:04:51.319> rare<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:52.340> know

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
age that's actually pretty rare you know

age that's actually pretty rare you know
you<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:52.669> plug<00:04:52.969> this<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.270> your<00:04:53.479> USB<00:04:53.870> port<00:04:54.110> it's

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
you just plug this in your USB port it's

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.439 
you just plug this in your USB port it's
always<00:04:54.590> charged<00:04:54.979> it's<00:04:55.819> not<00:04:56.000> really<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.270> concern

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
always charged it's not really a concern

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.119 
always charged it's not really a concern
to<00:04:56.689> run<00:04:56.810> out<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.139> bigger<00:04:57.530> concern<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.949> that

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
to run out the bigger concern is that

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.550 
to run out the bigger concern is that
the<00:04:58.430> form<00:04:58.669> factor<00:04:58.849> is<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.509> little<00:04:59.780> bit<00:04:59.900> big<00:05:00.080> you

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
the form factor is a little bit big you

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.869 
the form factor is a little bit big you
know<00:05:00.650> with<00:05:00.800> lithium<00:05:01.189> this<00:05:01.310> can<00:05:01.460> probably<00:05:01.759> be

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
know with lithium this can probably be

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.709 
know with lithium this can probably be
this<00:05:02.599> big<00:05:02.870> so<00:05:03.969> it's<00:05:04.969> it's<00:05:05.389> a<00:05:05.479> great

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
this big so it's it's a great
